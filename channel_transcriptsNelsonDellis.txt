=== I Memorized Every Super Bowl Winner Ever… Here’s How ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliX-VaG6FI

[00:00:00] Every year, like clockwork, the Super
[00:00:02] Bowl happens. Now, the majority of you
[00:00:04] watching this video probably don't care
[00:00:06] all that much about football. And every
[00:00:08] year, you're probably surrounded by
[00:00:10] friends who know a ton more about
[00:00:12] football than you do. And it makes you
[00:00:14] think to yourself, damn, should I be
[00:00:17] watching more
[00:00:19] football? The answer to that is no, by
[00:00:21] the way, because with this video, I'm
[00:00:23] about to teach you something no other
[00:00:24] football afficionado would ever know. At
[00:00:27] least not like you will after this
[00:00:28] video. And that thing is all of the
[00:00:30] Super Bowl winners in history in order.
[00:00:34] Whoa. Now, there are many ways to go
[00:00:36] about memorizing a list like this. I
[00:00:38] have tons of videos outlining the memory
[00:00:40] palace, the peg system, all these other
[00:00:42] things. In this video, we're going to
[00:00:43] talk about how to do it in what I think
[00:00:44] is the fastest way possible. Okay,
[00:00:46] that's the goal here. Let's get started,
[00:00:48] shall we? Here's how it's going to work.
[00:00:49] There are 50 plus Super Bowls that we
[00:00:51] have to learn. Wow. And of all the 32
[00:00:54] teams in the NFL, only 20 of them have
[00:00:57] won over the years. And a lot of them
[00:00:59] are repeats. Pat six, Steelers 6, 49ers
[00:01:02] five, Cowboys five, Bills
[00:01:07] [Music]
[00:01:10] zero. So, the first thing we need to do
[00:01:12] is have kind of a go-to image for each
[00:01:15] of these teams. Now, the wonderful thing
[00:01:17] about organized sports teams in America
[00:01:19] is they have mascots. And usually those
[00:01:21] mascots are a really simple thing to
[00:01:23] picture. Things like the patriots could
[00:01:25] be like a patriot or a soldier-like
[00:01:28] dude. Could also be an action like the
[00:01:31] action of patting something someone on
[00:01:33] the back or patting something dry.
[00:01:35] Raiders could be kind of like pirates.
[00:01:37] Dolphins can be dolphin. Bengals could
[00:01:39] be Ben. Well, they've never won the
[00:01:41] Super Bowl. Bills, well, they've never
[00:01:42] won the Super Bowl. What is a Buffalo
[00:01:44] Bill, by the way? Is it a buffalo named
[00:01:47] Bill? Is a Bill a type of Buffalo? I'm
[00:01:49] so confused. Isn't Buffalo Bill a guy
[00:01:51] like an old western cowboy dude?
[00:01:54] Steelers could be a bunch of robbers
[00:01:56] with masks on or it could be steel
[00:01:58] beams. Packers is a cheese wheel. Bears
[00:02:01] would be the Bears. The 49ers might be
[00:02:03] like an ice axe. Not an ice axe, an ice
[00:02:06] pick. No, not an ice pick. A a gold
[00:02:08] mining pickaxe. That's what I mean. Or
[00:02:11] it could be the Golden Gate Bridge. Who
[00:02:12] knows? You get the idea. Which leads me
[00:02:14] to the next point. What is the
[00:02:15] technique? Well, the quickest way is to
[00:02:18] come up with a story. a long story that
[00:02:20] connects a series of images that help
[00:02:22] you remember the names of the teams as
[00:02:25] they won in a certain order. Now, there
[00:02:27] are 50 plus Super Bowl winners, but I
[00:02:29] thought it would be a good idea to split
[00:02:31] the story into sections of 10. So, I'll
[00:02:34] have Super Bowl 1 to 10, the first part
[00:02:36] of the story, Super Bowl 11 to 20 is the
[00:02:39] second part, and so on until it takes us
[00:02:41] through where we currently are now,
[00:02:43] which I think is 58, or is this one 59?
[00:02:45] Whatever. We'll figure it out as we get
[00:02:47] there. Now, without babbling anymore,
[00:02:49] let's start the
[00:02:52] story. All right, so our first story,
[00:02:54] and these are going to be weird, okay?
[00:02:55] So, just go along with me. We start with
[00:02:57] two cheese wheels rolling down the hill,
[00:03:00] and it crashes into a jet that's parked
[00:03:03] there. It just explodes into flames. Out
[00:03:06] of the flames, suddenly appears a Indian
[00:03:09] chief with a big headdress. And he's
[00:03:11] pulling along or leading a horse. It's a
[00:03:14] bald cult bald in no hair and on the
[00:03:18] horse is a cowboy and they are walking
[00:03:20] along out of the flames. They make it
[00:03:22] all the way to the shore and then out of
[00:03:24] the shore in the water you see two
[00:03:26] dolphins jumping out and they're both
[00:03:28] holding steel beans. Two steel beans. So
[00:03:32] what do we got? We got packers. Packers.
[00:03:34] Those are the cheese wheels. Jets
[00:03:36] crashing to the jets. The Chiefs coming
[00:03:39] out of the fire pulling along a colt. So
[00:03:41] that's actually the Baltimore bald
[00:03:44] Baltimore Colts. There was a Cowboy
[00:03:46] Dallas Cowboys. They go to the shore.
[00:03:48] Two Dolphins, Miami Dolphins, Miami
[00:03:50] Dolphins, and then two Steel Beams,
[00:03:52] Steelers, Steelers. So that takes you
[00:03:53] through Super Bowl
[00:03:56] 10. Moving on in the next 10 from Super
[00:03:59] Bowl 11 to 20, here's the story. So a
[00:04:01] raider or let's call him a pirate, okay?
[00:04:04] He's got an oak leg, like one peg leg
[00:04:07] made of oak. And he fights a cowboy
[00:04:09] who's got two steel beams, kind of like
[00:04:11] the dolphins did, but this cowboy is
[00:04:13] holding two steel beams, one in each
[00:04:15] hand. Then another oaklegged pirate
[00:04:17] comes onto the scene carrying a pickaxe.
[00:04:20] He's dripping in red paint. Then another
[00:04:23] raider joins the scene except his leg is
[00:04:26] normal. No oak there, just a leg. And
[00:04:28] he's got another pickaxe in his hands
[00:04:30] and he's fighting a bear. Now, we have a
[00:04:32] lot of repeat winners and it goes back
[00:04:33] and forth and all that business. So,
[00:04:35] some of these images may sound totally
[00:04:37] random and they appear and disappear or
[00:04:39] join the party and there's a lot of
[00:04:40] these repeats, so you just have to
[00:04:42] account for it in your story. So, that's
[00:04:43] Super Bowl 11 through 20 that takes you
[00:04:46] from 1977 to 1986. So, to recap, we have
[00:04:50] a Raider with an oak leg. That's the
[00:04:52] Oakland Raiders. And he's fighting a
[00:04:55] Cowboy, Dallas Cowboys with two steel
[00:04:57] beams. Again, Steelers, Steelers. Then
[00:04:59] another Raider with an oak leg. That's
[00:05:01] the Oakland Raiders again. Has a
[00:05:02] pickaxe. That's the 49ers. He's pouring
[00:05:04] red paint on it. That's the Redskins.
[00:05:07] Then one more Raider joins in. He's got
[00:05:09] a regular leg-l leg. Look at me.
[00:05:13] Supposed to help you remember that it's
[00:05:14] the LA Raiders. He's also got a pickaxe.
[00:05:17] That's the 49ers yet again. And they're
[00:05:19] fighting a bear. That is the Chicago
[00:05:21] Bears.
[00:05:22] [Music]
[00:05:24] We're going to start with a giant, a
[00:05:26] massive giant covered in red paint. He's
[00:05:29] dripping red and he's holding two
[00:05:31] pickaxes and he's fighting this other
[00:05:34] giant who's also covered in red paint.
[00:05:36] No pickaxes. So that battle is going on
[00:05:38] when suddenly two cowboys show up and
[00:05:41] they start pickaxing another cowboy. So
[00:05:43] that's Super Bowl 21 through 30. That
[00:05:45] takes you from 1987 to 1996. So to
[00:05:49] recap, we have a Giant, that's the
[00:05:51] Giants, covered in red paint. That's the
[00:05:53] Redskins with two pickaxes. 49ers 49ers
[00:05:56] fighting another Giant covered in red
[00:05:58] paint. That's the Giants and the
[00:06:00] Redskins again. Then there's two Cowboys
[00:06:02] next to them. Dallas Cowboys. Dallas
[00:06:04] Cowboys. Pickaxing 49ers. Another
[00:06:07] cowboy. Dallas Cowboys. Now, time for a
[00:06:10] short intermission pause. At this point,
[00:06:12] I've shared about half the images for
[00:06:13] all the Super Bowl winners. So, what
[00:06:15] might be helpful, although you don't
[00:06:16] have to do this, is I'd encourage you to
[00:06:18] mentally recap what we've covered so
[00:06:20] far. So, pause the video, close your
[00:06:22] eyes, take your time, set the mood,
[00:06:25] whatever, and see if you can remember
[00:06:26] the three many stories I just told you.
[00:06:28] And now, whenever you're ready, let's
[00:06:31] continue. Hey, one more thing. My
[00:06:33] Everest Memory Master Class is going
[00:06:35] live very soon, and you can sign up for
[00:06:36] the weight lists to get notifications
[00:06:38] when you can register. I mentioned this
[00:06:40] cuz you're here learning how to do
[00:06:41] something with your memory. And this
[00:06:43] course is chalk full of stuff like this.
[00:06:45] How to maximize your memory, how to
[00:06:47] learn all the memory techniques to do
[00:06:48] stuff like this and more. way more. This
[00:06:51] is just but a taste, my friend. But
[00:06:53] anyways, quick plug for my course. If
[00:06:54] you're interested, I'll put the link in
[00:06:56] the description below or up here
[00:06:57] somewhere. And uh yeah, anyways, that's
[00:06:59] it.
[00:07:01] Bye. There's a single cheese wheel that
[00:07:04] rolls down and crashes into two Broncos,
[00:07:07] like the car, OJ Simpson's car. And
[00:07:08] who's driving them? Well, some Rams.
[00:07:11] Now, the cars keeps driving and suddenly
[00:07:13] it crashes into a bunch of Ravens. As
[00:07:15] they fly everywhere to avoid this car,
[00:07:17] they fly into a Patriot. So, a soldier,
[00:07:20] this soldier has a buck in his hand, a
[00:07:23] single buck, and he's patting it twice,
[00:07:26] just like that. And as he pats it twice,
[00:07:28] almost like a magic trick, that buck
[00:07:29] turns into steel. So, there you go. That
[00:07:32] goes through all the way Super Bowl 40
[00:07:34] from 1997. These were the years where I
[00:07:37] really remember 1997 all the way to
[00:07:39] 2006. All right, the recap. This time,
[00:07:41] we have a cheese wheel. That's the
[00:07:43] Packers rolling into two Broncos this
[00:07:45] time, the Denver Broncos. And the
[00:07:47] Broncos are being driven by Rams, the
[00:07:49] St. Louis Rams. As it drives along, it
[00:07:51] explodes into a bunch of Ravens,
[00:07:54] Baltimore Ravens. That's in the year
[00:07:55] 2000. Then they fly into a Patriot
[00:07:58] Patriots who is holding a buck like a
[00:08:01] dollar bill. That's the Buccaneers. He
[00:08:03] pats it twice. So, I'm using the verb
[00:08:05] here, but that's Patriots Patriots. And
[00:08:07] then it turns into steel. Pittsburgh
[00:08:09] Steelers
[00:08:10] [Music]
[00:08:11] again. All right, we're almost in the
[00:08:13] home stretch here. So, you can imagine
[00:08:14] that there's a Colt 45, a gun that
[00:08:17] shoots down a Giant. So imagine you have
[00:08:19] a cold 45 and just shoot at this big
[00:08:21] giant and he falls down and he happens
[00:08:24] to fall down and crush a steel sculpture
[00:08:28] of a saint eating some cheese. Obviously
[00:08:31] the sculpture gets crushed and a giant
[00:08:34] raven swoops in to eat the cheese. When
[00:08:36] it swoops in, the seahawk swoops in and
[00:08:39] snatches the cheese from the raven and
[00:08:41] then it tosses that cheese to a patriot
[00:08:44] who's driving another Bronco off into
[00:08:46] the sunset. That's 41 to 50. That's 2007
[00:08:50] to 2016. Okay. So, we have a Colt 45,
[00:08:53] that's the Indianapolis Colts, shooting
[00:08:55] a giant, that's the Giants again. That
[00:08:57] giant topples over on top of a steel
[00:08:59] sculpture of a Saint eating cheese.
[00:09:02] That's the Steelers, the Saints, and the
[00:09:04] Packers again. A giant raven, that's the
[00:09:06] Giants, and the Ravens, swoops in to eat
[00:09:08] the cheese. Then, a Seahawk, the Seattle
[00:09:11] Seahawks, swoops in to steal the cheese
[00:09:12] from it and then tosses that cheese to a
[00:09:15] Patriot. the Patriots who are driving in
[00:09:17] a Bronco, the Denver
[00:09:21] Broncos. So, there's a patriot or a
[00:09:23] soldier with a huge eagle tattoo on its
[00:09:26] back. So, this soldier with the eagle
[00:09:28] tattoo pats a chief who's holding a buck
[00:09:31] and then he rams two chiefs and then
[00:09:33] flies away like an eagle. All right, we
[00:09:36] have the final recap. There's a soldier
[00:09:38] or a patriot. That's the Pats with an
[00:09:40] eagle tattoo on its back. The Eagles.
[00:09:42] And he pats a Chief on the back who's
[00:09:45] holding a buck. That's the Patriots, the
[00:09:47] Chiefs, and the Bucks. Again, the Tom
[00:09:49] Brady. And then they ram two Chiefs. So,
[00:09:52] the LA Rams, Chiefs, Chiefs, and then
[00:09:54] they fly away like an eagle, the
[00:09:58] Eagles. There you go. That That's it.
[00:10:01] Super Bowl one all the way to 59. from
[00:10:04] 1967 all the way to 2025.
[00:10:10] Nice. Now, you have these six different
[00:10:12] stories. It would be the easiest to say
[00:10:15] them all in order, but with a bit of
[00:10:17] practice, if somebody were to say, "Hey,
[00:10:19] who won Super Bowl 13 or Super Bowl 25
[00:10:22] or Super Bowl 51?" What you would do is
[00:10:24] go to that specific story for that
[00:10:26] decade. And then count through the ones.
[00:10:28] You know, they all start on the one. So,
[00:10:31] if they say, "What's the 13th one?" go
[00:10:33] to the second story which starts at 11
[00:10:36] and go to two images down. Right? So we
[00:10:38] have the Raider with the oak leg that
[00:10:39] was 11 fighting a cowboy that had two
[00:10:42] steel beams. Right? Those were the two
[00:10:44] Steelers. So the 13th Super Bowl winner,
[00:10:46] Super Bowl 13 were the Pittsburgh
[00:10:48] Steelers. Now another trick you can do
[00:10:50] is for every fifth Super Bowl winner in
[00:10:52] each of the stories, you can add a
[00:10:54] little pneummonic device to help you
[00:10:55] remember that that was the middle one,
[00:10:57] right? So for example, in the first set
[00:10:59] 1 through 10, the middle one was the
[00:11:01] bald colt. That was number five, Super
[00:11:04] Bowl five. So, you could imagine maybe
[00:11:06] this bald colt actually had just five
[00:11:08] little hairs sprouting on the back of
[00:11:10] his head. That way, if I said, "Hey, who
[00:11:11] won Super Bowl six?" You'd know that
[00:11:13] it's just the image that was right after
[00:11:15] the bald colt, which was the Dallas
[00:11:17] Cowboys. And just so you don't forget,
[00:11:20] Super Bowl 7 and 8 went to these guys.
[00:11:23] All right, that's probably the only time
[00:11:24] they're ever going to win this damn
[00:11:26] thing.
[00:11:28] I am trainer Abdul. Now, I know that
[00:11:31] there are better ways to store this
[00:11:33] information, but again, this is the
[00:11:34] quick and dirty way. You can even change
[00:11:36] some of these images if you don't like
[00:11:37] them or you think of something more
[00:11:39] creative. The goal is to say, "Hey,
[00:11:41] people at this Super Bowl party, look
[00:11:43] what I can do. Look what I can do." I
[00:11:45] bet you don't know all the Super Bowl
[00:11:46] winners, but I can recite them and I can
[00:11:48] tell you the years. 1967, we had the
[00:11:51] Packers. Then we had the Packers. Then
[00:11:53] we had the Jets, the Chiefs, Baltimore
[00:11:55] Colts. Did you know they were the
[00:11:56] Baltimore Colts back then? Probably not.
[00:11:58] Then we have the Dallas Cowboys, Miami
[00:12:00] Dolphins, Miami Dolphins, the Pittsburgh
[00:12:01] Steelers, Pittsburgh Steelers, and so
[00:12:03] on. And you look like a genius. Genius.
[00:12:09] Mic drop, grab a chip, watch the game,
[00:12:12] continue to not understand what's going
[00:12:14] on, and then go home as a legend. You
[00:12:16] are a legend, sir. All right, guys.
[00:12:18] That's the end of this video. I hope
[00:12:19] that was interesting. Try it. See how it
[00:12:21] goes for you. If you manage to pull this
[00:12:22] off and show it off, please let me know

[00:12:27] please consider subscribing to this
[00:12:29] wonderful channel. I have many other
[00:12:31] videos that teach awesome memory
[00:12:32] techniques, not necessarily for sports,
[00:12:34] but all sorts of things that teach you
[00:12:36] how to memorize the alphabet backwards
[00:12:38] or how to learn Braille, how to learn
[00:12:40] Morse code, how to learn all the state
[00:12:43] capitals. All right, enough talking. You
[00:12:45] got a game to watch. I'll see you in the
[00:12:46] next video. I'm out.

=== The Feynman Point #piday ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1g1EDFHTdSA

[00:00:00] one of the coolest things hidden inside
[00:00:01] Pi is the Fineman Point Pi is supposed
[00:00:04] to be this random never-ending
[00:00:05] irrational number which just means its
[00:00:07] decimal expansion is infinite and non-re
[00:00:09] repeating but at exactly the 762 decimal
[00:00:12] place something really cool happens
[00:00:14] there are six nines in a row
[00:00:17] 999999 just sitting there as if Pi
[00:00:19] glitched out for a second now out of the
[00:00:21] 10,000 digits that I know from memory I
[00:00:23] love just going up to this point because
[00:00:26] as the famous physicist Richard fan
[00:00:28] joked he said if you memorize p to this
[00:00:30] point you could just start saying
[00:00:33] 999999 and so on and pretend like you
[00:00:35] knew the whole thing but no Pi doesn't
[00:00:37] actually stop there so why does this
[00:00:38] happen well it's just luck in an
[00:00:40] infinite patternless sequence like Pi
[00:00:42] stuff like this is bound to show up
[00:00:43] somewhere in fact later on in pi you'll
[00:00:45] find even longer stretches of repeated
[00:00:46] numbers for example at position 24,
[00:00:49] 658619561

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWXMc1nsFk

[00:00:00] all right another one of these videos
[00:00:02] and I found myself again in Orlando
[00:00:05] Florida at the 2024 USA memory
[00:00:08] championship and guess what I caved in
[00:00:12] welcome to the 2024 USA memory
[00:00:16] Championship we're in the same location
[00:00:18] as last year but something is very
[00:00:20] different this year I can't believe I'm
[00:00:21] saying this but I'm competing this year
[00:00:24] it's foggy out here in the Orlando
[00:00:27] humidity let me clean this off but yeah
[00:00:29] I'm back uh I don't know what I'm
[00:00:30] thinking but uh I'm out of retirement
[00:00:33] from this brief retirement of 3 years
[00:00:35] and I am going to compete today in the
[00:00:37] finals that's very commendable of you
[00:00:38] Nelson and throw my hat in the ring to
[00:00:40] win and defend I'm still defending the
[00:00:43] championship I won in 2021 nobody ever
[00:00:45] took that away from me so I'm
[00:00:46] technically defending my title do one
[00:00:48] more here but I'm also trying to win my
[00:00:50] sixth title am I in over my head at the
[00:00:53] age of 40 we'll find out
[00:00:56] [Music]
[00:01:11] now before we dive into the nitty-gritty
[00:01:13] of how the competition went down let's
[00:01:14] meet some of the competitors first we
[00:01:16] had Bry Lewis he was the first one to
[00:01:18] show up at the venue I had never seen
[00:01:20] this guy before and man did he undersell
[00:01:22] himself hey my name is Bry Lewis I'm
[00:01:25] from witw Kansas originally I'm here to
[00:01:27] compete in the USA memory Championship
[00:01:29] love this gu to me he was very calm and
[00:01:31] collected but very quickly into the
[00:01:33] competition you saw that he was there
[00:01:34] and he meant business nervous super
[00:01:36] nervous but we'll see how it goes this
[00:01:38] was Ian Leu he was there last year and
[00:01:41] he qualified yet again I'm very nervous
[00:01:44] uh but yeah I mean it's exciting I've
[00:01:45] been here one time uh did like
[00:01:47] absolutely awful but you know hopefully
[00:01:49] this time goes better excited to see
[00:01:51] what progress he's made this year and
[00:01:53] Matthew I'm from Richmond Virginia or I
[00:01:55] guess it's my sixth year he's one of the
[00:01:58] top contenders this year and I'm just
[00:01:59] hoping that I Cann outl him this is
[00:02:01] Patricia Lee a newcomer no idea what
[00:02:03] she's capable of but her qualifying
[00:02:06] scores were absolutely wild yeah so I
[00:02:09] actually knew about this for about a
[00:02:11] decade now um because when I was younger
[00:02:13] my teachers used to tell me that I
[00:02:15] should probably compete in something
[00:02:17] like this that teacher is correct and so
[00:02:20] what ended up happening though once I
[00:02:21] came of age I kind of just made excuses
[00:02:23] every single year as to not um I really
[00:02:26] was just very lazy but I finally got
[00:02:28] into it this summer and even as
[00:02:31] unprepared as I felt every year even
[00:02:33] with this being the busiest year of my
[00:02:34] life I was kind of just like I think I
[00:02:36] just need to start at some point and I
[00:02:37] don't have to aim to win necessarily and
[00:02:39] so I decided to just finally start and
[00:02:41] she later told me that she really
[00:02:42] doesn't have any memory technique so
[00:02:43] what the f is that then we had Annabella
[00:02:46] Kang she was a newcomer too I just
[00:02:48] really wanted to find ways to help um
[00:02:50] improve my ability to focus and um I
[00:02:54] just really want to challenge myself and
[00:02:55] see how far I can get did great in the
[00:02:56] qualifiers I'm not sure what she's
[00:02:58] capable of so we'll see Jason Smith a
[00:03:01] veteran by this point and I'd say I was
[00:03:03] probably the most visibly worried about
[00:03:05] him here for the memory competition
[00:03:08] feeling good trying to uh do better than
[00:03:10] I did last year this would be my third
[00:03:12] uh final eram was here last year he was
[00:03:15] great competitor I'm here because I
[00:03:16] wanted to come back after competing last
[00:03:18] year I first started when my I saw my
[00:03:21] mom reading Moon walking with Einstein
[00:03:24] and I kind of stole away from the book
[00:03:26] from her that I started last year I made
[00:03:29] it to the final
[00:03:30] and I'm coming back this year to see if
[00:03:32] I can do better hey erum give the book
[00:03:34] back to your mom come on my name is
[00:03:35] Amanda Zang and I'm from New York City
[00:03:37] she had great qualifying scores and this
[00:03:40] was her first time competing I'm feeling
[00:03:42] very nervous definitely but I'm also
[00:03:44] very excited and happy that I have an
[00:03:45] opportunity to be here my name is
[00:03:47] McKenna good and I'm from Richmond
[00:03:49] Virginia now McKenna was the 2020 winner
[00:03:52] when we had a virtual event I started
[00:03:54] when I was about 10 and I started
[00:03:55] memorizing pie just for fun with no
[00:03:57] techniques and then I saw John grandma
[00:03:59] on a TV show and decided that I could
[00:04:02] try the techniques out and ever since
[00:04:04] then I've been just working hard to get
[00:04:06] better at the actual techniques and I
[00:04:08] already have like a natural Talent so
[00:04:10] that helps into it so may sha he was
[00:04:12] there last year and I think the year
[00:04:13] before that I started with the online
[00:04:16] competition in 2020 I got like 50th
[00:04:19] which is not great but then I competed
[00:04:21] the years after and I've been a finalist
[00:04:23] for 4 years feel all right I'm not too
[00:04:25] confident in the long term I haven't had
[00:04:27] much time to memorize all of it but feel
[00:04:29] pretty good about the other events uh-oh
[00:04:31] that's not going to help you get past
[00:04:32] the first round Bud AI chavda well I
[00:04:34] first competed in 2018 which was the
[00:04:36] competition which I think introduced the
[00:04:38] long-term memory event and it was held
[00:04:41] at MIT I play second at that competition
[00:04:43] and then life medical training uh a
[00:04:46] couple of moves got in the way this is
[00:04:48] my first time back in about six years
[00:04:50] and it's been a been a fun run so far
[00:04:53] now as you know this competition I've
[00:04:55] said it many a time it's basically a
[00:04:58] dayong event where we just mem Miz a
[00:05:00] bunch of stuff and whoever memorizes the
[00:05:02] most and is the most accurate ends up
[00:05:04] being the champion back in the day the
[00:05:06] competition used to literally be a full
[00:05:07] day the morning was filled with
[00:05:09] different events memorizing cards
[00:05:11] numbers faces poems and the top 8 to 10
[00:05:16] would go into the afternoon qualifier
[00:05:17] events since Co they've gotten rid of
[00:05:19] the qualifiers and done it online a
[00:05:21] month before and the finals the
[00:05:24] afternoon rounds the elimination rounds
[00:05:26] are now done live on stage at full sale
[00:05:29] univers unity in Orlando which is known
[00:05:31] for its production abilities and yeah
[00:05:33] that's it now let's see what happened
[00:05:35] and how the competition went down
[00:05:36] welcome to the 25th USA memory
[00:05:39] Championship starting with round one we
[00:05:42] had long-term memory this year we had to
[00:05:44] memorize all 63 US National Parks and a
[00:05:47] ton of data about them now it was paired
[00:05:49] down in terms of the amount of
[00:05:50] information that was given compared to
[00:05:51] years past so I was anticipating this
[00:05:53] round would go quite far because a lot
[00:05:55] of people probably found it easier to
[00:05:58] prepare let's studying I was right it
[00:06:01] went down to the last round where they
[00:06:02] were allowed to ask us pretty much any
[00:06:04] complicated question they could come up
[00:06:06] with and it got pretty hard pretty fast
[00:06:08] what national parks are larger than
[00:06:11] 10,000 square miles and where are they
[00:06:17] located oh my God and that wasn't even
[00:06:20] the hardest one this round you could get
[00:06:21] three strikes before you were out and
[00:06:23] three people were going to be eliminated
[00:06:24] I was a bit shaky in this round for
[00:06:26] whatever reason I made a silly mistake
[00:06:28] on one of the earlier questions I just
[00:06:29] flubbed a number for no apparent reason
[00:06:32] the square mileage would be
[00:06:35] 52 thankfully Ian got out Sam got out
[00:06:38] and then Annabella got out just before
[00:06:40] me and so I made it through to the next
[00:06:42] round on to round two words to remember
[00:06:44] you get 15 minutes backstage to memorize
[00:06:46] as many words as you can from a random
[00:06:48] 300w list you get two strikes in this
[00:06:50] event and then you're out unfortunately
[00:06:52] Amanda got out Makenna got out and then
[00:06:55] Patricia got out on the word rack damn I
[00:06:57] was hoping she would go further
[00:06:59] round three was the Tea Party event this
[00:07:01] is when we're shown videos of random
[00:07:03] people saying their names where they're
[00:07:04] from their favorite food favorite sport
[00:07:07] they're all Moder their birthday all
[00:07:09] sorts of stuff and we get three strikes
[00:07:11] and this decides who's going to be the
[00:07:12] three finalists in The Final Round going
[00:07:15] into this was bryley Avi Matt erom me
[00:07:18] and Jason I got a strike early but then
[00:07:20] I was perfect from then on and erom Matt
[00:07:22] and Jason got their three strikes they
[00:07:24] were
[00:07:26] out the final round two decks of cards s
[00:07:29] you have to memorize these in 5 minutes
[00:07:31] on stage with all the pressure on you
[00:07:33] all the lights and then one mistake and
[00:07:35] you're out from what I understood we all
[00:07:37] went for two complete decks the problem
[00:07:39] was they memorized it in reverse order
[00:07:42] this often happens at memory
[00:07:43] championships people choose the wrong
[00:07:45] direction and Javi was out super quick
[00:07:47] on card number eight three of hearts
[00:07:50] that is incorrect and Then bryley
[00:07:52] followed on card number 10 it was wild
[00:07:55] four diamonds that is incorrect so there
[00:07:58] it was champ before even knew it the
[00:08:00] 2024 USA memory
[00:08:04] Champion now let let let's address the
[00:08:06] elephant in the room I've been saying
[00:08:08] all this time that I probably never
[00:08:09] going to compete again and we'll look at
[00:08:11] the video but last year I was kind of
[00:08:14] opening the door a crack a smidge if you
[00:08:17] will and it all depended on John Graham
[00:08:18] who was the current champion uh he's a
[00:08:21] three-time champion and you know I was
[00:08:23] thinking well if he competed and
[00:08:24] probably won this year he'd be a
[00:08:26] four-time champ and then you know if I
[00:08:28] let him compete next year year he could
[00:08:30] potentially get that fifth title and I
[00:08:31] didn't want him to tie how many titles I
[00:08:33] had which was five so I thought to
[00:08:36] myself well maybe I preemptively compete
[00:08:40] this year you know not assuming
[00:08:42] necessarily that I win but give him a
[00:08:44] run for his money and hopefully I can
[00:08:46] block him from getting that fourth and I
[00:08:48] get a sixth and then I kind of pull some
[00:08:50] distance away from him that was like a a
[00:08:52] dream or a thought in my head I wasn't
[00:08:54] saying that I was going to do that but
[00:08:55] at least I had opened my mind to maybe
[00:08:57] competing it was more realis istic that
[00:09:00] if he won this year I would come back
[00:09:02] next year and we'd have this great
[00:09:04] [Music]
[00:09:05] Showdown what is he doing he's beginning
[00:09:09] to
[00:09:13] believe but one thing that I remember
[00:09:16] last year very clearly and I said it I
[00:09:18] know I said it at the beginning of the
[00:09:19] video is I felt like I was missing out I
[00:09:22] know the year before that I remember
[00:09:23] watching and commentating and being like
[00:09:25] I so glad I'm not on that stage I do not
[00:09:28] miss the nerves but last year I was like
[00:09:31] man I should be up on that stage I miss
[00:09:33] that I want that
[00:09:35] like that hunger and that feeling of
[00:09:38] maybe going to win and then winning and
[00:09:40] so this
[00:09:41] year I don't know what happened I had a
[00:09:44] bunch of crazy stuff happened to me this
[00:09:46] summer and I've been really in touch
[00:09:48] with kind of my inner intuition and my
[00:09:51] inner voice and and kind of the thoughts
[00:09:53] that come in my head I recognize him and
[00:09:54] one that kept coming up was that I'm not
[00:09:57] done yet not done yet I'm not done yet
[00:10:01] and so literally the the day before I
[00:10:03] needed to tell the organizers whether I
[00:10:05] was in or out I talked with my wife a
[00:10:07] lot I I thought about it a lot I was
[00:10:09] like well you know if I lose it's going
[00:10:12] to suck right because I like how I went
[00:10:15] out in 2021 I won at the top of my game
[00:10:18] I got my fifth win and I I went out as a
[00:10:22] winner I didn't want to go out as a
[00:10:24] loser I never like that in sports I like
[00:10:26] when they go out when they're at the top
[00:10:28] you know and and I did that so why mess
[00:10:31] with that so I needed to be sure that I
[00:10:32] would be in contention to win this thing
[00:10:35] and I felt good something in me said
[00:10:39] that I was going to win it and I don't
[00:10:41] mean it like I was the best and I'm
[00:10:44] better than anybody I just saw the path
[00:10:46] and I saw that I was going to be there
[00:10:48] at the end I saw myself holding this at
[00:10:50] the end I saw it and I felt it and it
[00:10:51] felt real so I had this confidence that
[00:10:53] yeah I'm going to do it it's it'll be
[00:10:55] good for me it'll satisfy this need that
[00:10:57] I have and then it'll also you know help
[00:10:59] me out with some of the projects I have
[00:11:01] coming up I think it will fit very
[00:11:02] nicely with that fresh title so I called
[00:11:05] up Karen and Tony and said hey make room
[00:11:08] for me I'm going to be in this
[00:11:09] competition first thing after that that
[00:11:11] I did was I actually messaged John
[00:11:12] Graham and I said hey I know you're
[00:11:15] retired because he actually recently
[00:11:17] announced that he was retiring surprise
[00:11:19] I didn't expect that um I said listen
[00:11:22] I'm going to compete I would love it if
[00:11:24] you unretired and competed with me one
[00:11:27] last time you know I wanted to open that
[00:11:28] door to him I didn't want him to think
[00:11:30] that I was diving in because he had said
[00:11:32] he was out I didn't want it to be like
[00:11:34] that and honestly I want to win in an
[00:11:36] honorable fashion I don't want to win
[00:11:38] just because it's like an easy year or
[00:11:39] something like that which it wasn't by
[00:11:41] the way but he stuck to his guns he
[00:11:42] wasn't going to back on his word at
[00:11:44] least for now you know I'm 40 I've got
[00:11:46] four kids on six and under and I don't
[00:11:48] really have much time to give to this
[00:11:51] anymore um but I made time my wife made
[00:11:54] a comment also that like she's never
[00:11:56] seen me so dedicated to something in a
[00:11:58] long time so that was a really really
[00:11:59] cool feeling and yeah I won Hell Yeah
[00:12:02] feels awesome to win again at six time
[00:12:05] champ now am I competing next year I can
[00:12:09] say 100% I'm done competing I'm done I
[00:12:13] really am I'm happy I don't need a
[00:12:15] seventh I don't need anym that's a
[00:12:18] beautiful thing I'm happy with the way I
[00:12:19] wrap this up
[00:12:21] truly
[00:12:25] truly I'm serious I'm serious all right
[00:12:27] next thing we got to do it's very
[00:12:29] customary is we're going to watch last
[00:12:30] year's video and uh make fun of what
[00:12:33] Nelson from 2023 was talking about here
[00:12:37] competition is basically a bunch of
[00:12:38] people getting together to memorize a
[00:12:40] bunch of random stuff and seeing who has
[00:12:42] the best memory I used to have the best
[00:12:44] memory I no longer in the mix so other
[00:12:46] people are coming up rising up from out
[00:12:48] of nowhere becoming the new best
[00:12:51] memorizers in the United States that's
[00:12:53] true you know I definitely wasn't the
[00:12:54] best person there I don't think maybe
[00:12:56] the most experienced that's for sure but
[00:12:59] man I'm excited for where the sport is
[00:13:01] going to go without me or John there's
[00:13:03] some real Gunners there like if they
[00:13:06] keep at it and I think that's the big
[00:13:08] thing is like who's going to keep
[00:13:10] training some of these people in the
[00:13:12] past year they've looked really
[00:13:13] impressive and they've kind of dipped
[00:13:14] their toe and then we never see them
[00:13:16] again but I think if some of these
[00:13:18] people that came this year last year if
[00:13:20] they come back and they train I think
[00:13:23] it's going to be pretty exciting we have
[00:13:24] this kind of ongoing joke now it was
[00:13:26] more of a joke last year but now it's
[00:13:28] getting not so funny but basically as
[00:13:30] soon as he gets close to beating my
[00:13:32] record of five titles which is the most
[00:13:34] winningest uh amount of titles um in
[00:13:37] history of the competition I'm going to
[00:13:39] have to come back right because I can't
[00:13:41] let him take that record you understand
[00:13:42] that that's my record and he's got three
[00:13:45] so I can afford one more and then I have
[00:13:48] to come back he still has three I shook
[00:13:50] things up uh now I have six and he has
[00:13:53] three he's got a big gap to jump and um
[00:13:55] listen if anybody can do it he can do it
[00:13:57] but uh I made the task purposefully a
[00:14:00] little harder for him now I can't even
[00:14:02] let him tie my record I don't want that
[00:14:03] to happen
[00:14:05] so I don't know I'm almost thinking
[00:14:08] maybe uh maybe next year I got to do
[00:14:10] something about it and uh uh deter him
[00:14:13] from from going for for more that's
[00:14:16] funny cuz you can kind of see a glimmer
[00:14:18] in my eye that uh I maybe already had a
[00:14:21] serious inkling that I was going to do
[00:14:23] this although I will say I did not have
[00:14:25] that decided maybe deep down my Deeper
[00:14:28] Self knew that again the goal wasn't to
[00:14:30] fully deter John um I think I maybe did
[00:14:33] a little bit of that but as a
[00:14:34] consequence but it was really purely for
[00:14:36] me and just going with what my gut said
[00:14:38] to do all right as is customary in past
[00:14:41] uh videos like this I usually take a
[00:14:43] portion of last year's video and I react
[00:14:45] to it it's usually me reacting to a
[00:14:49] video where I was reacting but now we're
[00:14:50] so deep down the Inception Rabbit Hole
[00:14:52] deer that I think that this technically
[00:14:54] will be me reacting to me reacting to me
[00:14:57] reacting to me reacting reacting to me
[00:14:59] reacting and now I'm reacting to that
[00:15:02] really reacting to last year's video but
[00:15:04] my other reactions happen to be nested
[00:15:06] within that video
[00:15:09] yeah I wonder how many years I'm going
[00:15:11] to do this because eventually I'm going
[00:15:12] to have a reaction to reaction to a
[00:15:14] reaction to a reaction to reaction how
[00:15:17] many explosions can I do in a
[00:15:24] video I mean I I'm keeping the tradition
[00:15:27] going I don't know much how much longer
[00:15:28] I'm going to make these uh nested videos
[00:15:31] but um here I am doing another one after
[00:15:33] a while my little box within a box
[00:15:35] within a box is going to be ever so
[00:15:41] tiny
[00:15:51] 1 now he joins the two-time champion
[00:15:53] Club so we got we got John Graham we got
[00:15:57] uh RAM Coley we got joh white we got me
[00:16:00] we got Scott hagwood and we got ta taana
[00:16:05] Kuli I think there I got to say a little
[00:16:07] story about Scott hagwood since that
[00:16:09] comes up here I've never met the guy
[00:16:11] he's maybe the one memory champion this
[00:16:13] historical legendary memory champion
[00:16:15] from the early years he won four
[00:16:17] straight it was Tatiana kulie she won
[00:16:19] the first three years and Scott hagwood
[00:16:21] took it all four years in a row after
[00:16:23] that and I've never met him I've heard
[00:16:25] so many things about him I've tried to
[00:16:27] reach out to him I didn't even know if I
[00:16:28] had his write email I've been to events
[00:16:31] thinking he was going to be there or
[00:16:32] hoping he was going to be there so I
[00:16:33] could meet him never worked out I've
[00:16:35] never been able to reach out to him you
[00:16:37] know I'm flying back through Charlotte
[00:16:39] the next day after the Championship and
[00:16:41] I have some time to kill I'm at a
[00:16:43] communal table working on an edit
[00:16:45] actually editing the memory
[00:16:46] championships related um content and
[00:16:50] somebody sits opposite me on the table
[00:16:52] and I'm not really noticing them but
[00:16:54] after a while the guy goes excuse me sir
[00:16:56] um is your name Nelson dallis
[00:16:59] and I go yes and I think he's going to
[00:17:01] be like oh you know I've heard about you
[00:17:03] you know I've read your book or
[00:17:04] something like that seen you on YouTube
[00:17:07] he was like I'm Scott hagwood I almost
[00:17:10] flipped out of my chair I I I got up I
[00:17:13] walked around I was like you have got to
[00:17:15] be kidding me are you serious right now
[00:17:18] at this table and he didn't do it on
[00:17:20] purpose I mean he recognized me but he
[00:17:21] didn't sit down cuz he recognized me he
[00:17:23] sat down he told me this just randomly
[00:17:26] he wanted to get breakfast or something
[00:17:27] and then he noticed it was me how Wild
[00:17:29] is that the day after the Championship
[00:17:31] while I'm editing the championship
[00:17:33] content and we had a moment and I was so
[00:17:35] excited to meet him one of my heroes
[00:17:37] that I've never met what a nice guy that
[00:17:39] was absolutely wild anyways let's keep
[00:17:42] going man I still remember winning that
[00:17:44] championship and how meaningful it was
[00:17:47] to me at the time that feeling has not
[00:17:49] gone away yet this is the trophy for the
[00:17:51] championship know it is not a I will say
[00:17:54] that I do remember how it felt in 2021
[00:17:58] it was such a sad satisfying win and I
[00:17:59] think the reason it felt that way is
[00:18:01] because I had lost a few times over the
[00:18:03] years before that right I had lost in
[00:18:05] 2018 and 19 and 20 so I was like come on
[00:18:08] let me just get that win and I can stop
[00:18:10] and then be happy so there was this
[00:18:12] sense of relief when I won this time
[00:18:15] while I was very
[00:18:17] happy there wasn't this sense of relief
[00:18:20] there also wasn't a sense of emptiness
[00:18:21] that usually follows which is
[00:18:23] interesting and there wasn't kind of the
[00:18:25] sense of like I got to get the next one
[00:18:27] I was just like cool I got it it felt
[00:18:29] very matter of fact I I wonder if it's
[00:18:32] because I had felt that it was going to
[00:18:35] be mine like I had seen it so clearly so
[00:18:38] many times in my head that when I got it
[00:18:40] in my hands it was like well yeah that's
[00:18:42] where it belongs sorry I know that
[00:18:44] sounds again bad but that's truly how I
[00:18:47] felt and the come down or the come off
[00:18:50] of that win was one of the I'd say
[00:18:53] weaker reactions you can even see me
[00:18:55] when I win um it seemed like a very like
[00:18:58] BL
[00:18:59] reaction granted the the the event
[00:19:02] itself stopped very quickly I didn't
[00:19:03] expect that but I didn't fist pump I
[00:19:05] didn't like dance around I I almost had
[00:19:08] like a very plain look on my face and
[00:19:10] that's kind of how I felt inside you
[00:19:12] know I was very appreciative very happy
[00:19:13] but it was like cool yeah nice I knew
[00:19:16] that and and it happened and and great
[00:19:18] you know no it is not a bong and yes it
[00:19:22] is a seahorse why is it a seahorse well
[00:19:25] because I have so many of these now this
[00:19:26] is my fifth one the sixth one the first
[00:19:29] year was actually an eagle that was uh I
[00:19:32] I accidentally broke had a very fine
[00:19:34] point attached to the mantle and um I
[00:19:36] think I put it in the box and it just
[00:19:38] snapped okay I lost again again and I
[00:19:43] lost again and again now I can say I won
[00:19:46] again again again again again and now I
[00:19:49] can say I didn't either same thing here
[00:19:53] I did not win I did not lose I just did
[00:19:56] the same damn thing and it feels kind of
[00:19:58] nice but also kind of feels like I'm
[00:20:00] really missing out I got that that fomo
[00:20:02] was building and I could say I won again
[00:20:04] again again again again again but
[00:20:06] there's a bunch of losses in the middle
[00:20:08] there but you get the idea nice nice and
[00:20:13] I won this time mind you with kids which
[00:20:16] you can hear crying in the yard and now
[00:20:19] I have even more kids and now I have
[00:20:22] even more kids and now I have even more
[00:20:23] kids seriously Help Me Maybe it's cuz I
[00:20:26] didn't have to compete um but I
[00:20:28] definitely felt like I would have put up
[00:20:29] a good fight against John had I been
[00:20:31] there I wish I had now with regards to
[00:20:34] that I have not trained very much in the
[00:20:36] last year I've worked on very specific
[00:20:38] memory projects some for my YouTube
[00:20:39] videos some for other things um but
[00:20:42] cards while I still do them for
[00:20:44] demonstrations are not at my Peak right
[00:20:47] now I did trade a lot once I decided I
[00:20:50] was going to compete which is basically
[00:20:51] a month before the competition I was
[00:20:53] training double deck of cards every
[00:20:54] single day and at first it was pretty
[00:20:57] Rusty and I was like like o I don't know
[00:21:00] if I should be even competing but after
[00:21:02] the first week I was back in business he
[00:21:04] came back very quick you know I was as
[00:21:06] good as I ever was at the two decks of
[00:21:08] cards so that was really exciting to see
[00:21:10] that that that came back pretty quickly
[00:21:12] I actually had to re- remember some of
[00:21:14] the memory palaces I used for that I I
[00:21:17] felt very well trained wasn't better
[00:21:19] than any past years but I'd say I was
[00:21:21] close or if not the same which was cool
[00:21:24] at 40 years old right and retired like I
[00:21:27] was able to come back you know and get
[00:21:28] back that was that was pretty cool I a
[00:21:30] twinkle in my my thoughts twink but now
[00:21:34] it's like uh I can almost see it right
[00:21:37] you could see it there and uh you could
[00:21:39] see it growing let's get going you know
[00:21:41] 10 years later from my first win and you
[00:21:45] know here I am I I I won again and 2009
[00:21:48] was my first competition so 2013 eight
[00:21:51] years later I'm still here although I
[00:21:53] think this is it I I really do I say
[00:21:56] that now but I I really believe five is
[00:21:58] was the number I was looking for I got
[00:22:00] it I don't know five still feels really
[00:22:03] good you know what five does not feel
[00:22:05] that good anymore you know I can put it
[00:22:07] on one
[00:22:08] hand but man can you imagine having to
[00:22:11] use two hands it's it's so funny the
[00:22:14] perspectives right like it's funny
[00:22:18] because I didn't know that I forgot that
[00:22:20] I said that um that you know I would
[00:22:22] want to hold two hands to do it Michael
[00:22:25] Jordan style I kind of know this is so
[00:22:28] stupid to say but like five felt cool I
[00:22:31] think like it's very easy like five time
[00:22:32] Champion six it's almost starting to get
[00:22:35] to the point where it's like the person
[00:22:36] hearing that might question like well
[00:22:38] how easy is this competition you know
[00:22:40] like if you're winning against like
[00:22:43] 5-year-olds at some stupid skill and
[00:22:45] you're like I'm a 17 times Champion well
[00:22:48] you think well maybe you should try
[00:22:49] something a little harder or something
[00:22:51] like that I promise that these
[00:22:52] competitions are very hard a lot of
[00:22:54] people can vouch for them to be
[00:22:55] challenging okay I don't know but that's
[00:22:57] funny that I I I thought at this point
[00:22:59] that six would sound good I definitely
[00:23:01] don't think seven would sound much
[00:23:03] better although no I'm just kidding well
[00:23:06] no I'm serious I
[00:23:09] will I feel very like sure in all of
[00:23:13] these videos here but in a year you know
[00:23:16] I I I knew this would happen I would
[00:23:19] change and feel like maybe one more
[00:23:22] right but the thing that terrifies me
[00:23:24] still is if I go and compete and I lose
[00:23:27] right what do I do with that do I go
[00:23:29] slink back to the Shadows never to
[00:23:31] compete again just got my hands swapped
[00:23:35] yeah you can't compete anymore or then
[00:23:37] do I just have to keep competing until I
[00:23:39] win another one right and that was my
[00:23:41] fear right uh that was really what was
[00:23:44] decision maker was like how do I deal
[00:23:46] with it if I lose and I toil back and
[00:23:48] forth and I realized you know what it's
[00:23:50] not the end of the world I had a good
[00:23:51] run and who can blame me for wanting to
[00:23:54] go back to a sport that I love and it's
[00:23:55] not that shameful to to give it another
[00:23:57] shot you know does it taint my story
[00:24:00] maybe but ultimately who am I trying to
[00:24:02] impress here right like I'm doing this
[00:24:04] because I love it and I want to
[00:24:06] challenge myself and I did ended up on
[00:24:07] the right side of things with a wind but
[00:24:09] I was okay I prepared myself you know to
[00:24:12] deal with not having an Ending Story
[00:24:14] where I I won not that I like that but I
[00:24:17] knew what I was getting myself into and
[00:24:20] I think I would have been okay with that
[00:24:22] yeah luckily it it went all right
[00:24:24] anyways let's see what else I say here
[00:24:26] you know from that perspective now it's
[00:24:28] still feels like I'm So Satisfied by it
[00:24:30] very proud of myself back then um that's
[00:24:33] not going to change yeah I still feel
[00:24:36] that way that 2021 Nelson did an awesome
[00:24:39] thing that was a really good win and I'm
[00:24:42] I'm pretty sure like in the future I'll
[00:24:43] look back at this competition and feel
[00:24:45] very proud of it I do feel proud of it
[00:24:47] another thing I can hang up on my shelf
[00:24:50] and and just say like yeah did that at
[00:24:53] 40 years old in the situation the busy
[00:24:55] life that I lead the Crazy Life that
[00:24:57] doesn't allow for much
[00:25:00] anymore yeah
[00:25:03] awesome yeah with that you know maybe we
[00:25:06] don't need to watch the rest here we
[00:25:08] know what
[00:25:09] happens anyways not much else to say
[00:25:12] here other than thanks for watching and
[00:25:14] if you haven't seen the entire
[00:25:16] Championship streamed you can go check
[00:25:18] it out on the link in the description or

[00:25:24] coming hopefully I can get back to my
[00:25:26] little role of helping create a better
[00:25:29] event and uh making it a bigger sport
[00:25:31] for the for the world and the community

=== MEMORIZING 2718 DIGITS OF e 🤓 (LIVE) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmlhAAbniOA

[00:00:08] are we live I think we are live let's
[00:00:10] just double
[00:00:21] check nice here we
[00:00:28] are all right well welcome
[00:00:32] everybody let me close
[00:00:41] that
[00:00:43] nice welcome to a live stream uh I don't
[00:00:47] do many of these but uh decided after
[00:00:50] watching a stream a few weeks back uh
[00:00:53] extra Emily memorizing a thousand digits
[00:00:55] live and she's not even a memory person
[00:00:59] uh spent 11 hours encoding and
[00:01:02] memorizing a thousand digits of pi I was
[00:01:04] like I do stuff like that all the time I
[00:01:06] just never do it live uh or or I make a
[00:01:09] video about it and it's highly edited
[00:01:12] down for you know entertainment's sake
[00:01:15] so it seemed like a lot of you out there
[00:01:17] wanted to see me do this live with
[00:01:20] something that I've never touched before
[00:01:23] um and many of you know that I memorized
[00:01:25] pi to many many digits uh 10,000 digits
[00:01:28] to be exact actually a little bit more
[00:01:30] now um so I didn't want to do the same
[00:01:33] old thing I wanted to do something a
[00:01:34] little bit different I come from a math
[00:01:36] background so the first thing I thought
[00:01:38] about was memorizing the mathematical
[00:01:41] constant e which many people use all the
[00:01:45] time but maybe aren't familiar with it
[00:01:48] definitely doesn't have the
[00:01:49] 3.1415 ETC um uh obvious recognition to
[00:01:54] it um but we see e all the time
[00:01:58] everywhere so today we're going to start
[00:02:01] with a few things first I'm going to
[00:02:03] talk about what this thing is just to
[00:02:05] refresh your memory then I'm going to
[00:02:06] talk about why I'm doing it
[00:02:09] and kind of a deeper reason for going
[00:02:12] about it then we're going to kind of get
[00:02:14] into the nitty-gritty all right so I
[00:02:15] literally know
[00:02:19] 2.718 I kind of know a little more just
[00:02:21] because I've seen it and the first few
[00:02:22] digits are aren't that hard um but I
[00:02:25] don't know very many digits of this
[00:02:27] thing and it is a number that goes on
[00:02:30] forever and ever and ever just like Pi
[00:02:32] so there's an opportunity to memorize
[00:02:34] thousands and thousands millions and
[00:02:36] millions of digits um I'm not going to
[00:02:38] do that but um the first three digits of
[00:02:42] the number it's
[00:02:43] 2.718 so the point of today is to
[00:02:46] memorize
[00:02:49] 2,718 digits of that thought that would
[00:02:51] be kind of poetic a lot of people when
[00:02:53] they do PI they try to memorize 3,141
[00:02:56] digits of pi uh Sabrina Cruz from answer
[00:03:00] in progress another YouTube channel did
[00:03:02] that with my training that was really
[00:03:04] cool so I'm going to kind of do the same
[00:03:06] thing but with uh uh e and uh all in one
[00:03:10] session so I'll talk to you about how I
[00:03:12] go about memorizing numbers in general
[00:03:15] um how I would go about memorizing such
[00:03:17] a large number in one
[00:03:19] sitting then I will go through the
[00:03:22] Memory Palace that I build through the
[00:03:24] images that I create for all the numbers
[00:03:26] and then the boring part I have to
[00:03:29] memorize it but hopefully I can do that
[00:03:31] FAS is um and then the recall right so
[00:03:35] there's a few ways we can do the
[00:03:36] recall I want it to be as honest with
[00:03:39] you as possible so I think the best is
[00:03:41] to do it blindfolded and say it um I
[00:03:43] have a website that I created so that
[00:03:45] you guys can follow along and or the
[00:03:48] other way is there's another software
[00:03:50] that I can just type them in but I can
[00:03:52] see obviously so I don't want anybody to
[00:03:53] think that I'm cheating I do have uh
[00:03:56] earphones in but that's only so I uh can
[00:03:59] hear
[00:04:00] um myself making sure that this stream
[00:04:02] is going well but I can take those out
[00:04:04] when I do the recall um let's see have
[00:04:06] some chats here so if you want to ask
[00:04:08] questions as this happens uh please
[00:04:11] share and I will get to them as I can um
[00:04:15] but yeah a lot of the stuff I'm going to
[00:04:16] go
[00:04:17] over uh already who gave me this idea
[00:04:20] yeah I was inspired by extra Emily
[00:04:22] another content creator on Twitch she
[00:04:25] did something with pi
[00:04:27] um and uh yeah
[00:04:30] I guess let's get started the thing I
[00:04:34] want to show is this so there is many of
[00:04:40] you don't maybe even know this um hold
[00:04:43] on one second where is
[00:04:46] that
[00:04:48] um shoot all right well that's fine we
[00:04:51] can open it up here I'm G to switch
[00:04:53] views
[00:04:56] here how's that all right so you should
[00:05:00] be able to still see me and now you can
[00:05:01] also see my screen
[00:05:03] here um first of all I created this
[00:05:08] website 27.
[00:05:11] Uno uh it's literally the numbers that
[00:05:13] we're memorizing today just so that it's
[00:05:15] very easy and there's a counter at the
[00:05:17] top here so I can go through and it
[00:05:19] shows me where I am so as I'm maybe
[00:05:22] reciting these blindfolded I can tap
[00:05:25] through them and you can know where I am
[00:05:27] and verify that I'm saying these
[00:05:28] correctly all right right this is just a
[00:05:30] little website I designed and this is
[00:05:33] the last digit I probably should have
[00:05:35] done 2720 to clean that margin up but uh
[00:05:41] the point is to make this mirror the
[00:05:43] first few digits of uh e all right so
[00:05:48] the first thing we should go over is
[00:05:49] what the freak is this thing okay um let
[00:05:53] me just make sure that you can now see
[00:05:57] this perpose perfect y oh somebody asked
[00:06:00] how long was the preparation for this so
[00:06:02] I try to do uh very little preparation
[00:06:06] that's the whole point is I wanted to do
[00:06:08] this on the stream now obviously I made
[00:06:10] this website um I did find the digits
[00:06:13] that I need to memorize so I've seen
[00:06:14] them uh you know I but I haven't
[00:06:17] memorized them so um it's essentially a
[00:06:20] lot of planning for the stream but not
[00:06:22] necessarily any planning for the actual
[00:06:24] memorizing today I wanted to keep that
[00:06:26] as raw as possible so you can see the
[00:06:28] process as if I were doing it without
[00:06:31] you all watching you know all right so
[00:06:34] that's the the the page we're going to
[00:06:36] use for reference those digits are
[00:06:37] correct I've pulled them from a bunch of
[00:06:39] resources it's actually not as easy to
[00:06:41] find uh so many digits as it is for pi
[00:06:44] um but I pull these from Mathematica
[00:06:47] which is accurate to however many digits
[00:06:49] you want it to be and um let's see yeah
[00:06:54] you guys can come in and out I'm going
[00:06:55] to be doing this for a few hours I
[00:06:57] presume so you don't have to sit here
[00:06:58] and watch this whole thing um but come
[00:07:00] in and check out how I'm doing and uh
[00:07:04] yeah now let's talk about uh I can't
[00:07:10] spell let's talk about this constant
[00:07:13] here uh here we go so this is oil's
[00:07:17] number okay famous mathematician and you
[00:07:21] know oil's number um was based after
[00:07:24] Swiss mathematician Leonard oer um and
[00:07:29] da du the thing that I love about this
[00:07:32] number is this famous relation we used
[00:07:34] it in uh the higher level maths that I
[00:07:37] took back in the day where is it should
[00:07:39] be here
[00:07:42] um and it's just I think the most
[00:07:45] elegant equation in all of math to be
[00:07:48] honest and here it
[00:07:49] is uh e to the I Pi + 1 equal zero I
[00:07:54] love this because of course it relates e
[00:07:58] to Pi which are the two things that I uh
[00:08:02] well after today the two things I have
[00:08:04] memorized a lot of um yeah so e is what
[00:08:08] you might see in things related to
[00:08:10] exponents um uh there's probably a
[00:08:13] better way to explain this here the
[00:08:14] number e is mathematical constant
[00:08:16] approximately equal to
[00:08:18] 2.71828 we'll get that much further down
[00:08:21] uh and and precise today uh that can be
[00:08:24] characterized in many ways it's the base
[00:08:25] of the natural logarithm function right
[00:08:28] so if you've ever done it the math
[00:08:29] problems where you had a natural log Ln
[00:08:33] and you had to get rid of it on one side
[00:08:35] of the equation you usually had to uh
[00:08:37] involve e in some way U right so um it's
[00:08:42] the base of natural logarithm function
[00:08:44] it's also the limit of 1 + 1 / n to the
[00:08:47] n as n tends to Infinity not that that
[00:08:49] should mean anything to you but you
[00:08:51] probably have seen it in the issue of
[00:08:53] compound interest um in the equation
[00:08:57] uh uh yeah what else
[00:09:02] here yeah there there's so much with
[00:09:04] this um you can write it as the sum of
[00:09:07] this infinite series here of one over n
[00:09:09] to the um n
[00:09:11] factorial uh what
[00:09:14] else yeah just a very curious number and
[00:09:18] uh there are many digits to it
[00:09:20] now there is a pi
[00:09:24] world record ranking list
[00:09:29] in case y all didn't
[00:09:30] know and the pi ranking right says you
[00:09:34] know who's memorized the most digits
[00:09:36] this is shesh Kumar Sharma did 70,000
[00:09:39] digits of pi that's the current verified
[00:09:42] record there is an unverified record of
[00:09:46] um just over 100,000 digits all right
[00:09:49] and then you know there's many many many
[00:09:53] people on this list I'm on this list
[00:09:55] somewhere nothing impressive I haven't
[00:09:57] performed this is saying all the digits
[00:09:59] from the first one to the end um so I've
[00:10:02] done other stuff with pi I just haven't
[00:10:04] recited much there I am I need to update
[00:10:07] that because I could easily do a lot
[00:10:09] more but anyways I did this back in
[00:10:11] covid times all right but notice that at
[00:10:14] the top here there's actually an E
[00:10:15] ranking and even a square root of two
[00:10:18] ranking and so if you look on this list
[00:10:21] uh actually if I were to memorize what
[00:10:23] I'm going to memorize today that would
[00:10:24] put me at eighth place here pretty cool
[00:10:28] in the world and even cooler is if we go
[00:10:31] by continent here it would be a North
[00:10:34] American record all right so 1636 isn't
[00:10:38] that many digits uh so um this is
[00:10:42] something that uh I hope to beat today
[00:10:45] all right so I'm reing e uh to break a
[00:10:50] record I'm doing it also to share with
[00:10:52] you guys how I do this process so
[00:10:55] instructional but also um there is some
[00:10:57] kind of motivation here
[00:10:59] okay all right what else um before we
[00:11:02] start I think that's kind of
[00:11:05] it yeah I'll maybe go over just the the
[00:11:08] the general approach here
[00:11:11] so um and maybe we want a little
[00:11:13] calculator on here just so you can see
[00:11:16] what uh needs to happen here and this is
[00:11:17] what I will do uh whenever I have to
[00:11:19] memorize anything is I look at what I
[00:11:22] have in front of me uh first I see what
[00:11:24] do I know and in this case I know
[00:11:27] nothing except for the 2.7
[00:11:29] 718 um or so so I'm assuming I know
[00:11:34] nothing I'm going to use my number
[00:11:36] system okay so you notice here that
[00:11:38] these have been partitioned in groups of
[00:11:40] eight on purpose uh my number system is
[00:11:45] uh eight digits grouping all right and
[00:11:48] it's a Pao if you've ever heard of that
[00:11:50] before which is a person action object
[00:11:52] so the way I do it is the first three is
[00:11:55] a person the second uh two digits in the
[00:11:58] middle whoops
[00:12:00] um are the action some kind of verb that
[00:12:03] the first person is doing and then uh
[00:12:05] the last three are an object so it's
[00:12:07] always a person doing something with an
[00:12:11] object okay and I do that over and over
[00:12:13] again for each chunk of eight all right
[00:12:16] and this is a system that I've built
[00:12:17] many years ago in fact I'm more
[00:12:19] comfortable honestly with a seven-digit
[00:12:21] system where it's three digits for the
[00:12:23] person two for an action two for an
[00:12:25] object but I I did develop an
[00:12:27] eight-digit uh system I I used it for
[00:12:30] quite a while like around 2015 16 then I
[00:12:34] kind of stopped cuz it was a lot to
[00:12:36] maintain um but for today is I kind of
[00:12:38] relearned it a little bit so that I
[00:12:40] could cover more ground uh with each
[00:12:43] image that's the idea here so um I may
[00:12:46] be a little bit Rusty on some of my
[00:12:48] images here and I may have to look them
[00:12:50] up in my uh big spreadsheet um so bear
[00:12:55] with me that's just because I'm not in
[00:12:57] competition form these days
[00:13:00] uh but yeah anyway so if we
[00:13:03] do where is my
[00:13:08] calculator
[00:13:11] 2718 ID by
[00:13:13] 8 we have 3 essentially
[00:13:17] 40 um different groupings of eight right
[00:13:21] so today if I want to remember this
[00:13:23] number I need to remember
[00:13:25] 340 scenes or images or paos okay
[00:13:29] and that will be um me needing 340
[00:13:35] Memory Palace locations okay so each of
[00:13:38] these images you might think well how do
[00:13:40] you memorize all of those in order right
[00:13:43] 340 distinct little stories right well
[00:13:46] each of them are going to go into a
[00:13:48] location in a Memory Palace I have tons
[00:13:51] of videos on memory palaces but
[00:13:52] essentially what it is is you choose a
[00:13:55] place a real place that you can think of
[00:13:57] in your mind that you're familiar with
[00:13:59] and you mentally walk through it and
[00:14:01] along the way at different spots or
[00:14:04] distinct anchor locations uh along this
[00:14:06] route you can place each of these images
[00:14:09] and the idea is that uh we remember
[00:14:11] spatial information better so when you
[00:14:13] recall it and you go back through the
[00:14:14] route it's easy to pick up the images
[00:14:16] that you left there which you then
[00:14:18] translate back to these numbers okay so
[00:14:21] that means I need a Memory Palace that
[00:14:23] has 340 locations okay that's a lot but
[00:14:27] it's not that bad um especially if it's
[00:14:31] a quite a large place that you can go
[00:14:34] through quite some distance so I have
[00:14:37] pre-thought about this I'm going to use
[00:14:39] a Memory Palace um from a mountain climb
[00:14:44] that I recently did uh and that I do
[00:14:46] often which is Kil majara I run a trip
[00:14:49] there basically every year I have a
[00:14:50] company that does that um I've been up
[00:14:53] there five or six times and uh yeah so
[00:14:57] it's going to I'm going to build this
[00:14:58] memory pth Palace starting in you know
[00:15:02] thinking of the whole trip we start in
[00:15:03] the hotel then we go to the mountain we
[00:15:05] go to the summit then we come back try
[00:15:07] travel all the way back home so I'm
[00:15:08] going to build My Memory Palace out of
[00:15:10] that and I have an idea for it in my
[00:15:12] head I've actually gone through those
[00:15:13] 340 locations so um that I guess is some
[00:15:16] of the preparation I've done beforehand
[00:15:18] because otherwise it'll be boring and
[00:15:19] you don't know this place so me going
[00:15:21] through it here isn't really you to make
[00:15:24] much sense um and even when I write it
[00:15:26] out as you'll see in a moment uh you may
[00:15:29] not understand what I'm thinking but uh
[00:15:32] just know it is a place and it is a
[00:15:34] location that I know okay so I need 340
[00:15:38] of
[00:15:38] those that's still a lot so I think what
[00:15:41] I might do is kind of break it up into
[00:15:43] thousands so I'll do the first thousand
[00:15:46] um kind of study that then I'll do the
[00:15:49] next thousand study that and then I'll
[00:15:50] do the remaining 700 or
[00:15:52] so what I need to do in my document is
[00:15:56] write out the 340 locations that's what
[00:15:59] I'm going to do first so that they're
[00:16:01] there and then I'm going to go through
[00:16:02] these numbers and translate them to the
[00:16:06] image and I'm going to write the image
[00:16:09] next to the location on my document
[00:16:11] because that's what I'm going to study
[00:16:13] all right and if I can get that then the
[00:16:16] translation to the numbers should more
[00:16:18] or less be there there may be some
[00:16:20] mistakes I make just because I'm a bit
[00:16:22] Rusty with the numbers um but I can
[00:16:25] always learn from my mistakes and then
[00:16:27] attempt again okay then the final thing
[00:16:30] hopefully that we do here is I recite
[00:16:32] all of them we're all happy you guys
[00:16:34] confirm it uh and then uh we're done for
[00:16:38] today right let me see what people are
[00:16:41] saying in the chat
[00:16:44] here on the spot yes doing this on the
[00:16:47] spot
[00:16:50] uh great idea to live stream it it'll be
[00:16:53] loving to see how you go about it thank
[00:16:54] you yeah will I be using the major
[00:16:56] system and the Pao system all right so
[00:16:58] again I said I'm using the Pao system as
[00:17:01] you'll learn when I start saying some of
[00:17:03] my images for these
[00:17:05] numbers it it's quite a unique system
[00:17:08] nobody really does this that I know of
[00:17:11] um my persons and objects are three
[00:17:15] digits so there's a thousand of them
[00:17:16] that I know and they're based on kind of
[00:17:18] like a originally um Dominic system to
[00:17:22] translate them I'll go over that in a
[00:17:23] bit and then also a little bit of major
[00:17:25] system involved um but at this point I
[00:17:27] usually just know the number so I don't
[00:17:29] have to think about any of that stuff I
[00:17:32] just know 718 for example this first one
[00:17:34] is Joe pesi just is um and if you want
[00:17:38] to know a little more why uh
[00:17:41] 18 so the second two digits is always
[00:17:44] kind of like the category so 18 is um uh
[00:17:48] what's his name Kevin mallister from
[00:17:50] Home Alone if you've ever seen that
[00:17:51] movie and so all the 18s 118 218 318 all
[00:17:55] the way to 9 18 are all characters from
[00:17:58] from that movie or that those two movies
[00:18:01] Home Alone or Home Alone 2 and so 718 is
[00:18:05] Joe pesi from that movie and the Seven
[00:18:08] uh which is a
[00:18:11] j sound
[00:18:15] uh that is incorrect why did I do that
[00:18:18] that should be a hard G this just tells
[00:18:21] you that my my the way I did this
[00:18:23] sometimes isn't correct but I don't even
[00:18:24] remember because I just know the number
[00:18:27] I I look at this number 78 and I I just
[00:18:29] see Joe pesi but the original idea
[00:18:32] should have been that the seven should
[00:18:33] have been a hard G sound um Joe peshi is
[00:18:38] not that um was there another see some
[00:18:41] of these I can't even remember what the
[00:18:43] reason was why it was maybe there was
[00:18:44] some other reason what is the
[00:18:46] character's name in Home Alone let me
[00:18:49] just check Joe
[00:18:51] pesi home
[00:18:56] alone uh
[00:19:04] hold on Home
[00:19:06] Alone going off on the tangent here but
[00:19:08] I got to figure this out
[00:19:14] um [ __ ] his name is Harry okay so yeah
[00:19:17] this just was uh honestly it was an
[00:19:19] encoding mistake years ago but it
[00:19:22] doesn't matter okay uh what's another
[00:19:24] example so 182 is um uh some of these I
[00:19:29] don't even know the character name but I
[00:19:30] just know what they look like it's the
[00:19:33] is it the the the the from Marvel the
[00:19:37] the the the guy that shoots ice streams
[00:19:40] um what's his name
[00:19:43] goddamn
[00:19:54] Marvel is it Iceman man I don't even
[00:19:57] know
[00:20:00] either way some of these you just have
[00:20:03] to accept that I just came up with them
[00:20:05] one day and I learned them for what they
[00:20:06] are but all the 82s are Marvel
[00:20:10] characters um like 082 is Hal Berry um
[00:20:15] 982 is
[00:20:17] um oh my God I don't even know the names
[00:20:20] of these characters I just see them I I
[00:20:22] really apologize uh this is a better one
[00:20:24] 845 is Zakir Hussein who's a too player
[00:20:27] and uh 4 5 uh are all musicians so 045
[00:20:33] is uh Duke Ellington um 145 is yoyo Ma
[00:20:38] and then 845 is Zakir Hussein and this
[00:20:40] one makes sense because the eight is an
[00:20:42] H in the Dominic system so Hussein helps
[00:20:45] me remember oh of the grouping of 45s
[00:20:48] the eighth one is Hussein Zakir Hussein
[00:20:51] but again I just see 8:45 and I know
[00:20:53] it's that um 90 is playing the base uh
[00:20:58] the action of playing the Bas and then
[00:21:00] 452 is a DeLorean all the five tws have
[00:21:04] to do with Back to the Future um
[00:21:07] 452 is Doc Brown the four is a D in The
[00:21:12] Dominic system in this case like I said
[00:21:14] before sometimes I use Dominic system
[00:21:16] sometimes I use major system sounds
[00:21:18] depends um but his object is a DeLorean
[00:21:22] naturally okay so just to give you a
[00:21:24] taste this first uh image of my number
[00:21:28] is Joe peshi angry like squeezing uh an
[00:21:32] ice Stream So a stream of ice he's just
[00:21:34] like crushing it with his hands um the
[00:21:36] next one is Zakir Hussein too player
[00:21:39] Indian too player and he's playing bass
[00:21:42] guitar with a DeLorean as his pick so
[00:21:45] he's like slapping the Basse and he's
[00:21:47] got a little mini DeLorean in his
[00:21:49] hand uh this is uh John Mayor 353 he is
[00:21:54] ripping like a piece of paper kind of
[00:21:56] action uh a sliver of butter okay so 287
[00:22:00] is actually Butters from South Park so
[00:22:04] his object is uh butter makes sense so
[00:22:07] it's John Mayor ripping butter in half
[00:22:11] let's say uh this is Dexter from
[00:22:13] Dexter's Lab the cartoon uh he's pulling
[00:22:16] a gun pulling a gun on uh the Adam's
[00:22:19] Family baby from Adam's Family
[00:22:22] Values yeah I'm old I'm 40 so a lot of
[00:22:27] these references might age me quite a
[00:22:30] bit
[00:22:31] so apologize for that um but that's the
[00:22:36] thing all right hold on Silver Surfer is
[00:22:38] that it is it he yeah thank you okay
[00:22:41] Silver Surfer yeah um
[00:22:46] anyways someone asked why do I only use
[00:22:48] 99 digits for the actions great question
[00:22:51] so I could have easily instead of just
[00:22:53] eight digits here done nine right three
[00:22:56] three and three but
[00:22:59] originally when I started this I used
[00:23:01] 222 okay I had a 100 people 100 actions
[00:23:06] 100 objects that was a lot easier to
[00:23:08] learn back then and actually it's it's
[00:23:10] very powerful system many people still
[00:23:12] use it and can do way more numbers than
[00:23:13] I can uh very fast but at some point I
[00:23:17] was like I need more I need to expand my
[00:23:20] system to three digits right so coming
[00:23:22] up with three digigit uh people three
[00:23:25] digigit action three digigit objects
[00:23:27] seemed very daunting so I did in stages
[00:23:29] I first said okay I'm just going to
[00:23:31] create three digigit people so a
[00:23:33] thousand people and that's why I use the
[00:23:35] category system because I already had
[00:23:37] the two digits and then adding the one
[00:23:39] digit I just used the original and then
[00:23:42] found 10 others in that
[00:23:44] category so I learn that and then I
[00:23:46] would just do three-digit person
[00:23:49] two-digit action two-digit object and
[00:23:51] then the next phase was to uh come up
[00:23:53] with a thousand objects for each of
[00:23:55] those thousand people and then that was
[00:23:57] going to make my three to three
[00:24:00] three-digit person two-digit action
[00:24:01] three-digit object and then I never got
[00:24:04] around to making thousand actions and I
[00:24:07] kind of had this feeling that it might
[00:24:09] be really hard to come up with a
[00:24:11] thousand different unique actions
[00:24:14] probably is possible but um I'm really
[00:24:17] tight and comfortable with the ones that
[00:24:18] I have for the 100 so I just kept it
[00:24:21] like that and there's enough variety
[00:24:23] here in a massive number like this that
[00:24:26] yes I'll get a lot of um these
[00:24:29] actions uh repeating potentially but um
[00:24:33] mixed with the variety of thousand
[00:24:35] people thousand actions it's going to be
[00:24:37] next to Impossible uh to have a repeat
[00:24:41] chunk of eight um at least in this first
[00:24:44] I'm I'm sure somewhere uh in the never
[00:24:47] ending number of uh e it will reappear
[00:24:51] but here it does not and at least
[00:24:53] partition in the way I have it uh make
[00:24:55] it harder for it to repeat
[00:24:59] okay uh we've been talking for half hour
[00:25:02] [ __ ] okay we got to get started so the
[00:25:04] first thing I'm going to do is figure
[00:25:08] out uh
[00:25:11] my uh what do you call it uh memory
[00:25:17] pal and this should be relatively quick
[00:25:19] because I already have it kind of mapped
[00:25:21] in my head
[00:25:27] um well I don't even need to write these
[00:25:29] out okay
[00:25:30] so I'm going to start and this may not
[00:25:34] even make sense because I'm going to use
[00:25:36] it's hard to describe everything every
[00:25:38] location as something that will be
[00:25:40] meaningful to you so um I will just
[00:25:43] write down kind of like a little cue
[00:25:45] about what this
[00:25:48] um is to me and you'll just have to
[00:25:52] trust me here so um this is the entry
[00:25:55] gate to the hotel
[00:25:58] then we have the guard is sitting next
[00:26:01] to there there's a um parking lot
[00:26:05] there's a I'm in the bus then the front
[00:26:10] seat of
[00:26:11] Hotel uh the entryway of
[00:26:15] Hotel
[00:26:16] um like I said we'll do this for the
[00:26:19] first thousand which I believe I need
[00:26:23] 125 locations for the first thousand so
[00:26:25] we'll do that first um and then we'll
[00:26:27] move on to the second
[00:26:30] one again this is uh this is a long
[00:26:33] process so I uh you know you can watch
[00:26:36] you can leave and come back but I'm
[00:26:37] going to keep doing this because I am
[00:26:39] going to
[00:26:41] um uh learn this somebody says isn't it
[00:26:44] a p a system no because the the third
[00:26:47] grouping is um actually objects I mean
[00:26:51] some of them are uh animate things so
[00:26:55] there may be another some are papap but
[00:26:58] uh technically it's
[00:27:00] Pao uh do I have a list of mental images
[00:27:02] to
[00:27:03] download um I do not um I have them up
[00:27:08] here um but I do have a reference sheet
[00:27:10] somewhere if I forget um somebody asking
[00:27:13] what am I doing I am memorizing
[00:27:15] 2700 plus digits of e and right now I'm
[00:27:18] creating My Memory Palace to store them
[00:27:20] all um let's see entry W of Hotel
[00:27:24] um uh there's a store on the side then
[00:27:27] there's some side seats there then
[00:27:31] there's another set of
[00:27:33] seats uh front
[00:27:36] desk behind front
[00:27:39] desk uh side
[00:27:41] room side room side side room front side
[00:27:47] room other side these aren't the most
[00:27:49] descriptive things but I know what they
[00:27:50] are um base of
[00:27:53] stairs um board on wall
[00:27:58] open
[00:27:59] area back hallway storage room so when
[00:28:04] I'm coming up with a Memory Palace um I
[00:28:08] use you know sometimes some people just
[00:28:10] use rooms uh that's effective but I need
[00:28:13] to make use of my space really well
[00:28:15] because I have so many so this was
[00:28:17] technically just a couple rooms but I
[00:28:19] used a lot of pieces of them um for
[00:28:23] example this room uh there's you know
[00:28:27] basically I use four sides of the
[00:28:29] room
[00:28:31] uh and uh yeah that gave me four
[00:28:34] locations instead of just using the one
[00:28:35] room oh yeah I should also say that this
[00:28:38] uh video is sponsored by mind lab Pro
[00:28:42] all right uh this is my uh neut Tropic
[00:28:45] that I take every day it gives me a
[00:28:47] sharp edge uh when I memorize and I've
[00:28:51] definitely taken my dose this morning uh
[00:28:53] so I can stay a little sharper today but
[00:28:55] if you want to learn more about them uh
[00:28:57] just Google Google mindlab Pro or look
[00:28:59] in the Des description and you can check
[00:29:01] their stuff out I highly recommend
[00:29:05] them uh let's see are you writing the
[00:29:07] memory pales for us surely you know
[00:29:09] these already good question so I'm
[00:29:11] writing them out for a couple reasons
[00:29:13] one to show you and later because I'm
[00:29:15] going to write out my images next to
[00:29:17] them just so it's very clear uh but
[00:29:20] secondly this is relatively new Memory
[00:29:23] Palace I have thought about it roughly
[00:29:25] um but writing it down is especially for
[00:29:27] a big project like this is super
[00:29:29] important because it
[00:29:31] solidifies
[00:29:33] the it just like makes it firm in my
[00:29:36] mind sometimes when I think about a
[00:29:37] Memory Palace and I say like oh I'm
[00:29:38] going to go here blah blah blah blah
[00:29:40] blah it's good but it's still not like
[00:29:44] doesn't seem definite until I write it
[00:29:46] down so I always write down my memory
[00:29:47] pales not necessarily as a way to
[00:29:49] reference it but just as a way to almost
[00:29:51] say to myself this is what it is and it
[00:29:54] will not change okay and I can see all
[00:29:56] the numbers because I need a lot here um
[00:29:58] and like I said the first thousand are
[00:30:00] going to be 125 locations so I want to
[00:30:02] make sure I have 125 you know if I'm
[00:30:04] counting through it in my head I might
[00:30:06] miss one or something so anyways um so
[00:30:11] uh dining
[00:30:14] table uh small um
[00:30:18] serving uh table side
[00:30:22] table um
[00:30:24] toaster this is in a dining area um um
[00:30:29] other small
[00:30:31] table uh other side table I know these
[00:30:35] are generic names but they they work for
[00:30:37] me um outside table right side outside
[00:30:42] table left uh
[00:30:46] pool side under tent so now we're
[00:30:50] outside in the back of this place um uh
[00:30:56] layout uh uh
[00:30:59] chair um back of pool chair so I'm going
[00:31:05] around the pool here other side of
[00:31:07] [Music]
[00:31:09] chair uh there was a table where I was
[00:31:12] conducting business so let's call that
[00:31:14] business table um walkway there's a
[00:31:17] walkway in between then there was a tent
[00:31:20] set up on a little
[00:31:22] yard um then I was doing some exercises
[00:31:26] on that yard at one point
[00:31:28] then end of
[00:31:30] walkway uh high top there's a bar
[00:31:33] here um the bar itself behind the bar
[00:31:39] and then there was a pool
[00:31:41] table that kind of exhaust that area and
[00:31:44] if you want to know I'm in this is like
[00:31:46] my uh this is a hotel I stay in when I
[00:31:49] go to climb or run a trip up Kil minaro
[00:31:52] so I'm actually in a town called Moshi
[00:31:55] and this is a very specific Hotel I'm
[00:31:57] just going through through this hotel
[00:31:59] and obviously when I'm done with the
[00:32:00] hotel I'm probably going to go around
[00:32:01] the town and then eventually end up at
[00:32:04] the Gate of the park and then we're
[00:32:05] going to start climbing the mountain I'm
[00:32:07] going to be climbing the mountain
[00:32:08] placing my images
[00:32:10] there all right so the pool table let's
[00:32:12] see um up the
[00:32:15] stairs um first floor
[00:32:19] platform
[00:32:21] side of that oh no let's do um room
[00:32:26] front uh side of floor
[00:32:30] platform
[00:32:32] um front of my room uh inside my
[00:32:38] room
[00:32:43] uh outside a balcony
[00:32:46] door on the balcony um bedside table bed
[00:32:52] other bedside table bathroom
[00:32:58] then uh
[00:33:01] upstairs door
[00:33:04] bathroom upstairs this is a different
[00:33:06] floor a different room I stayed in um my
[00:33:10] bed Trevor's bed it was my roommate um
[00:33:16] balcony up there and then uh computer
[00:33:22] table all right so then we want to go
[00:33:24] back
[00:33:25] downstairs um back walkway
[00:33:28] front
[00:33:31] of uh Lisa's
[00:33:33] room um inside
[00:33:37] room bed there then front of Tom
[00:33:44] room I never went in there so next um
[00:33:48] outside the
[00:33:50] gate um front of convenience
[00:33:56] store that's the parking
[00:34:01] lot uh front of
[00:34:03] store uh aisle in store
[00:34:07] checkout of
[00:34:10] store um other outside
[00:34:15] part side gate there was a gate there
[00:34:18] front gate to
[00:34:21] restaurant uh
[00:34:24] table right side table left side ins
[00:34:28] side um high top
[00:34:33] table uh inside
[00:34:37] seating food serving
[00:34:41] bar kitchen and then the bar
[00:34:46] itself let's pause here for a
[00:34:49] second
[00:34:52] um what are your best practices to Sol
[00:34:54] solidify a mind Palace what attributes
[00:34:57] aspects of the pal is an object help you
[00:34:58] remember things the most I always call A
[00:35:01] Memory Palace a journey that's my the
[00:35:03] journey method because you know yes I'm
[00:35:06] using a place a palace um but to me it's
[00:35:09] really about the journey that I'm
[00:35:11] remembering so this is from a a few
[00:35:13] trips that I do I mean it's kind of a
[00:35:15] combination of multiple trips but the
[00:35:17] journey is the same you know start in
[00:35:19] the town make our way to the mountain
[00:35:21] yada Yad yada so a lot of these places
[00:35:24] I'm thinking of are tinged with memory
[00:35:27] of being
[00:35:28] and you know working with clients and
[00:35:30] preparing for the trip and stuff like
[00:35:31] that so um I like to choose memory
[00:35:33] palaces that have a lot of that uh
[00:35:37] already built-in meaning uh it adds to
[00:35:40] the stickiness of
[00:35:41] it um I've heard people using almost an
[00:35:44] algorithm for the creation of memory
[00:35:45] palaces like using nine images per wall
[00:35:47] like a diarama what do you think about
[00:35:49] this I'm going to go on what I just said
[00:35:52] I've seen people do that and that's fine
[00:35:53] I don't like it because if you just have
[00:35:56] a generic room and every room has is
[00:35:58] like a diarama with nine locations like
[00:36:00] a very grid-like structure it doesn't
[00:36:02] make it so memorable it's easy to forget
[00:36:04] or get confused with other rooms let's
[00:36:06] say so some of these you know it seems
[00:36:09] like I go into a room and I choose a lot
[00:36:11] of things and then another room it's not
[00:36:13] as plentiful um but that's that's just a
[00:36:16] feeling I just do what feels right um
[00:36:19] and that's kind of it I go with what is
[00:36:22] Meaningful I think how long do I think
[00:36:24] this challenge is going to take well
[00:36:26] considering I've I haven't even started
[00:36:28] memorizing um I hope to have everything
[00:36:30] set up or at least start memorizing uh
[00:36:32] once I have 125 locations we can
[00:36:34] memorize the first
[00:36:36] thousand in reality if I were to do this
[00:36:38] on my
[00:36:39] own um I would set up my memory Palace
[00:36:42] first but then I would just go and start
[00:36:45] memorizing you know I'd go silently in
[00:36:48] my head and that would be it but because
[00:36:50] I'm doing this to share with you um and
[00:36:52] because I want it to be more uh taking
[00:36:56] my time I'm going to write out the
[00:36:58] images I usually wouldn't do that but it
[00:37:00] is helpful for reference and for
[00:37:02] review
[00:37:06] um what else
[00:37:11] here I'm curious about my one-on-one
[00:37:14] coaching is it mostly for people without
[00:37:15] much
[00:37:16] experience um or people who are
[00:37:19] proficient no it's for everybody some
[00:37:20] people come to me who are very
[00:37:21] proficient and need help with whatever
[00:37:24] they're working on they're kind of stuck
[00:37:26] let's say or they want to advance
[00:37:28] other people come with me and they have
[00:37:29] come to me and they have no idea how to
[00:37:30] do anything and um I can work with
[00:37:34] either
[00:37:38] uh all right I'll come back to some of
[00:37:40] these questions let me just keep getting
[00:37:41] through this I don't want to get too far
[00:37:43] behind here so hang on the bar um after
[00:37:47] that let's go to we went to this
[00:37:50] barbecue place so front of BBQ
[00:37:54] Place uh inside BBQ place um side of
[00:38:01] Grill other side of
[00:38:05] Grill uh bathroom
[00:38:09] entrance um inside bathroom there was a
[00:38:13] stage where they were blasting music
[00:38:15] side of stage people were chilling um
[00:38:18] the table we were eating at there was a
[00:38:20] right side and a left side then there
[00:38:23] was a bar and then the parking
[00:38:26] lot yes I think that's that's good give
[00:38:30] me one second
[00:38:37] here yeah all right now let's do front
[00:38:41] of a gear store so I'm jumping around
[00:38:44] the town actually a little bit here
[00:38:45] because I don't know the whole town I
[00:38:47] haven't been everywhere so I'm just
[00:38:48] using places that are familiar and
[00:38:50] obviously they're not necessarily
[00:38:53] contiguous but in my mind in terms of
[00:38:56] the journey you know after we went to
[00:38:57] this barbecue spot we did go to the gear
[00:38:59] shop some people needed to get some
[00:39:01] extra gear for the the the hike um it
[00:39:04] was a tiny gear store uh and then nearby
[00:39:06] there was like a um uh what do you call
[00:39:11] it um souvenir store so we went there so
[00:39:15] that would be next here outside of
[00:39:17] souvenir store inside there was a
[00:39:21] counter then to the right of the counter
[00:39:24] it's kind of the edge of the store then
[00:39:27] in inside
[00:39:30] um cashier area then inside back corner
[00:39:35] and then back around
[00:39:38] front of the
[00:39:40] store other side okay so that's 100 25
[00:39:44] more um so now after this we want to go
[00:39:48] to I think we went to the orphanage
[00:39:51] there in the local town to the gate of
[00:39:52] the
[00:39:53] orphanage then there's our bus park
[00:39:56] there the stairs
[00:39:59] entryway side outside there's a
[00:40:03] classroom and outside performance the
[00:40:06] kids there did a performance for
[00:40:08] us uh area side some guy was doing some
[00:40:12] crazy balancing
[00:40:14] stuff this is a um orphanage it's not an
[00:40:18] orphanage well it is it's in in the town
[00:40:21] of Moshi in Tanzania um there are many
[00:40:25] kids who run away or are are abandoned
[00:40:28] uh from two to three to four 5 years old
[00:40:31] it's really sad um so the school kind of
[00:40:34] collects them or has a place for them to
[00:40:36] go uh and raises them uh and teaches
[00:40:41] them and all that stuff it's it's really
[00:40:43] a beautiful thing um I will share the
[00:40:46] link if anybody's
[00:40:48] interested uh in donating they love
[00:40:50] playing soccer anything if you want to
[00:40:52] donate that's a beautiful thing all
[00:40:54] right side um
[00:40:58] performance
[00:40:59] area then before basketball
[00:41:04] court then hoop one hoop two then soccer
[00:41:11] goal side of soccer
[00:41:13] field Midfield other soccer
[00:41:19] goal okay so we're almost there we need
[00:41:22] 10
[00:41:23] more um I'm going to jump to another
[00:41:25] hotel that we've stayed in before this
[00:41:27] is called the keys Hotel gate of the
[00:41:29] keys
[00:41:31] entryway front desk back
[00:41:35] room front area chairs dining table
[00:41:42] outside pool
[00:41:44] table uh sofa bar and outside eating
[00:41:50] area cool all right so this will cover
[00:41:54] uh a thousand digits right and if you
[00:41:57] don't don't believe me let's do the math
[00:41:59] here 125 *
[00:42:03] 8 voila all right so we're going to do
[00:42:06] two two chunks of this um and then we
[00:42:09] will have just 700 digits after that all
[00:42:11] right so let's start converting and
[00:42:13] listen I could do this for all
[00:42:16] 340 locations I don't need to because I
[00:42:20] want to get started right after I have a
[00:42:22] thousand digits that will feel better
[00:42:24] and you know even if we fail there or
[00:42:26] stop there at least we have a th digits
[00:42:27] all right so now uh one thing I need to
[00:42:31] do is pull all these numbers in um let's
[00:42:36] see one two three four five six seven
[00:42:39] eight nine
[00:42:41] 10 um so 10 of these will be a thousand
[00:42:46] right so one two three four five no what
[00:42:49] am I saying this is 80 right I need 125
[00:42:52] of these so let me just take the whole
[00:42:54] number
[00:43:00] and dump it in
[00:43:07] here
[00:43:09] oops all right there we
[00:43:15] go all right I'm trying to think what's
[00:43:18] the best way to do this um maybe let
[00:43:24] me create a new
[00:43:28] document I will put those
[00:43:31] numbers
[00:43:35] there
[00:43:42] shoot now I have an IT computer science
[00:43:45] programming background so in the past
[00:43:48] I've done stuff to uh automate this a
[00:43:50] bit better um but again when you
[00:43:53] automate things a lot you remove the
[00:43:55] work right which can sometimes help make
[00:43:58] this more memorable as a process so I'm
[00:44:00] really trying to do the raw Bare Bones
[00:44:03] way that I would do this without any
[00:44:05] extra I mean I'm already using computers
[00:44:08] to to kind of help this along but uh you
[00:44:10] get the
[00:44:12] idea um let's see
[00:44:16] so um I might make this a separate
[00:44:19] screen here so I
[00:44:25] can let me see that looks for you
[00:44:33] guys okay cool so we're going to start
[00:44:36] going through this and uh if this is
[00:44:40] 80 um let's see one two three four five
[00:44:44] six seven eight nine 10 that's
[00:44:55] 800 oh wait no this is doesn't split up
[00:44:57] the same
[00:44:59] unfortunately all right one two three
[00:45:01] four five six seven eight nine one two
[00:45:04] three four five six eight nine 10 so
[00:45:08] that's
[00:45:09] 900
[00:45:12] um one two three four five six seven
[00:45:16] eight
[00:45:17] nine 10 that's 80
[00:45:29] whatever it's somewhere around here um
[00:45:32] but let's just start okay so
[00:45:37] 718 I'm gonna
[00:45:48] this all right so we're starting there
[00:45:50] uh 718 that is Joe pesi um Joe pesi um
[00:45:56] and
[00:45:57] angry at an ice stream all right I'm
[00:46:00] going to try to do this faster next one
[00:46:02] is going to be Zakir
[00:46:06] Hussein um playing
[00:46:09] base with uh
[00:46:12] DeLorean all right next we have John
[00:46:16] Mayor and don't mind my spelling uh yeah
[00:46:20] that's not important here is ripping uh
[00:46:23] butter even sometimes my shorthand
[00:46:25] notation here
[00:46:27] um also some of these may be an
[00:46:29] inappropriate I don't want to offend
[00:46:30] anybody so I may use
[00:46:33] replacement words that aren't actually
[00:46:35] what they are but uh I'm just trying to
[00:46:39] you know get it uh out there for you to
[00:46:42] see but also something that um I'll have
[00:46:45] it in my head my other way so Dexter is
[00:46:48] pulling a
[00:46:50] gun on baby
[00:46:55] Adams and I'm not memor izing now I'm
[00:46:57] just writing this out so that's
[00:47:00] TBO opening a fridge and there's a radio
[00:47:05] inside entryway Hotel here that's
[00:47:09] Frieza um face is a
[00:47:14] rat um store that's
[00:47:18] Venom is zapping and
[00:47:22] yelling um this is Grandma
[00:47:27] sheer friend of mine well friend of
[00:47:29] mine's grandma is
[00:47:32] teaching how to play
[00:47:35] marbles then we have Ben Pridmore yeah
[00:47:39] he is
[00:47:41] teaching how to [ __ ]
[00:47:44] diarrhea cool all right then we have
[00:47:47] John Mayor
[00:47:50] again uh
[00:47:52] writing uh Green
[00:47:55] Lantern then behind the desk we have
[00:47:58] William
[00:48:00] defo uh he is shaking his butt on a
[00:48:06] thumb then we have Soup Nazi guy from uh
[00:48:13] Seinfeld he
[00:48:15] is uh shopping for Cousin It Like
[00:48:21] stuffing him in a
[00:48:23] bag side room side uh
[00:48:28] that is a Native
[00:48:32] American uh
[00:48:34] smoking Goomba from
[00:48:38] Mario uh then we have M bison from
[00:48:41] Street Fighter he is
[00:48:48] kaying uh
[00:48:50] notepad as a paddle then we have Conan
[00:48:55] O'Brien is is mopping up some
[00:48:59] salami then we have Tony
[00:49:03] Hawk uh is
[00:49:06] signing what is that that is
[00:49:09] 359 that is
[00:49:15] um Captain America shield
[00:49:24] oops cool all right then we have
[00:49:28] Sentinel that robot thing from The
[00:49:30] Matrix is uh playing base with a
[00:49:36] veil and we
[00:49:39] have
[00:49:42] Georgina uh she is
[00:49:44] sucking while grooving whatever that
[00:49:48] means so some of these you may notice
[00:49:50] like it's not like a perfect
[00:49:53] formulaic like some of my actions
[00:49:56] are I don't know how to describe them
[00:49:58] they're not necessarily verbs right
[00:50:00] they're a little more complex than that
[00:50:01] sometimes even the objects are other
[00:50:04] actions it's it's it's really a hodg
[00:50:06] Podge sometimes um you know when you
[00:50:08] come up with thousands different things
[00:50:10] you kind of have to be a little more
[00:50:11] creative so I apologize if that isn't
[00:50:14] fully clear here but ultimately it
[00:50:17] doesn't matter right whatever system you
[00:50:19] come up with and you learn that is your
[00:50:21] system and if you're consistent in
[00:50:23] learning that and you know it doesn't
[00:50:25] matter right because whatever numbers
[00:50:26] you're face with you um you know what
[00:50:29] they
[00:50:31] are
[00:50:34] um yeah hang let me
[00:50:36] see is he really doing
[00:50:43] this L notice that you use an object
[00:50:45] with your action opening a fridge do you
[00:50:47] do that with another like teaching yeah
[00:50:49] good question so L Angel asks you know
[00:50:52] sometimes I had opening a fridge right
[00:50:54] so that kind of involves an object in
[00:50:55] the action but it doesn't necessarily
[00:50:57] mean I'm seeing a fridge although
[00:50:59] sometimes I do because that one for
[00:51:02] example what was it a radio so I was
[00:51:03] opening a fridge and there was a radio
[00:51:05] inside right but I could have also had
[00:51:08] the verb like opening a radio right um
[00:51:11] and honestly sometimes I do stuff like
[00:51:13] that um other times it's you know the
[00:51:17] action involves an object and then the
[00:51:19] object after that is kind of a result or
[00:51:23] is is part of a sequence that involved
[00:51:24] the action to the first object if that
[00:51:26] makes sense
[00:51:28] um are these associations completely
[00:51:30] random no there is a r there is a system
[00:51:33] that I learned um and actually it might
[00:51:36] be helpful to to pull these up for you
[00:51:40] honestly um look for example this is my
[00:51:46] whole list all right
[00:51:48] um all my persons and action and objects
[00:51:52] all right and then my
[00:51:54] actions are here
[00:51:59] these are just 100 all
[00:52:02] right if anybody ever wants to see those
[00:52:05] I'd be happy to share them with you
[00:52:06] they're they're not necessarily secret
[00:52:09] or anything like that all right so over
[00:52:11] here we are here so that
[00:52:14] is um baseball
[00:52:19] player uh saying
[00:52:23] oops or like dropping something uh to a

[01:02:08] uh Emmit Smith football
[01:02:12] player buying a down
[01:02:16] suit all right let me look at the thing
[01:02:21] here fun fact the Catholic Church began
[01:02:24] to disapprove the use of method of Loi
[01:02:26] because of the lewed images priests were
[01:02:27] using to memorize the Bible I I don't
[01:02:29] know how true that is but I I wouldn't
[01:02:31] be surprised I love that
[01:02:35] um yeah limiting yourself to PG images
[01:02:39] uh does reduce a lot of possibilities
[01:02:41] for memorable limit uh situations that's
[01:02:46] sure um
[01:02:57] all right
[01:02:59] cool all right let's keep going this is
[01:03:01] going to take a while I feel like at
[01:03:03] some point you'll get the idea I might
[01:03:06] just revert to using uh a script that I
[01:03:08] wrote to generate the text here so I
[01:03:11] don't have to spend the the the time
[01:03:14] writing all 340 out um and then I can
[01:03:17] just start memorizing so maybe let me
[01:03:19] just finish this chunk and then for the
[01:03:22] other two chunks I will um zip along a
[01:03:25] bit faster we're already an hour in here
[01:03:29] um I don't want to I was hoping to
[01:03:31] finish by lunchtime but let's see all
[01:03:34] right so where were we this
[01:03:38] was we've done that okay so let's keep
[01:03:42] going so this is a
[01:03:45] mime funnily enough I don't think the
[01:03:47] memorization part is gonna take long uh
[01:03:51] I know that's kind of funny to say but
[01:03:54] this is the hard part like being able to
[01:03:56] recognize and be like okay that's my
[01:03:57] image then the actual memorization not
[01:04:00] hard that first pass I'll probably have
[01:04:03] 90% of it uh and then it's just a matter
[01:04:06] of review just going through it a couple
[01:04:08] times um active recall so a review by
[01:04:11] looking at what I have but also trying
[01:04:13] to recall it without looking is also
[01:04:15] very effective and then yeah we just
[01:04:18] build from
[01:04:19] there so mime is
[01:04:23] at at a desk with
[01:04:27] shampoo uh then we have a nun sucking on
[01:04:32] a down suit could have been a better
[01:04:35] image there uh we have a mime doing BG's

[01:16:55] uh putting a
[01:17:00] bulletproof
[01:17:02] vest on a
[01:17:05] chicken okay so that takes me through
[01:17:08] here this is the
[01:17:10] first
[01:17:15] thousand let me clean this up a little
[01:17:23] bit let me answer some your questions
[01:17:26] and then we are going to memorize
[01:17:31] this let me highlight this because we
[01:17:33] are done encoding this
[01:17:37] stuff nice all right let me look all
[01:17:41] right what's going on in the chat here
[01:17:43] uh what is this for great question I
[01:17:45] don't know for you guys uh for me I I
[01:17:49] like these challenges it's a number that
[01:17:51] I think is cool and it's different and I
[01:17:52] can get uh myself on a potentially a
[01:17:55] little bit of a record
[01:17:58] here uh yeah Mark asking here about how
[01:18:02] I may have uncomfortable images because
[01:18:05] I have family in here that's for sure
[01:18:07] but they're memorable
[01:18:11] um uh Rachel madow I don't even know why
[01:18:13] she's in there
[01:18:17] um all right cool so let's let's let's
[01:18:20] memorize this so now I got to actually
[01:18:23] go through this and and picture it on my
[01:18:28] location so I'm going to switch over to
[01:18:32] here and yeah I'm just going to go
[01:18:35] through this and maybe I'll I'll do this
[01:18:36] somewhat aloud so Jo pes's angry ice
[01:18:42] cream base with
[01:18:45] lauran is ripping
[01:18:48] butter de on
[01:18:55] uh baby Adams FR radio face is
[01:19:01] rat zapping
[01:19:05] yelling teaching marbles teacher
[01:19:08] [ __ ] horse maping
[01:19:26] me
[01:19:29] um might be easier doing it this way
[01:19:33] actually where was I
[01:19:37] here
[01:19:45] this so I'm actively memorizing these
[01:19:48] images not necessarily the numbers
[01:20:19] sorry for the silence I'm just trying to
[01:20:21] focus and and create these images in my
[01:20:23] mind
[01:20:24] attached to the
[01:20:53] location
[01:21:23] e e
[01:22:47] all right almost
[01:22:53] there e
[01:23:39] all right one thing I should note here
[01:23:43] is I'm not
[01:23:46] memorizing the like sentence I'm
[01:23:49] visualizing the thing I'm seeing the
[01:23:52] picture so lot of this is very quick cuz
[01:23:54] I'm really just seeing you know my dad
[01:23:57] my dad dragging a spoon let's say like
[01:23:59] that is a very quick image that
[01:24:01] just pops up in my head it's not like I
[01:24:04] have to memorize the words my dad is
[01:24:07] dragging a spoon I could do that but
[01:24:10] it's it's much faster to go to the
[01:24:12] direct source right which is the image
[01:24:14] uh and it's more powerful too all right
[01:24:17] so um and yes this is a fast first pass
[01:24:22] um but honestly
[01:24:24] what usually happens is I will memorize
[01:24:28] by looking at this right uh without
[01:24:31] having to write everything out so as I'm
[01:24:34] kind of going through this silently by
[01:24:36] myself without an audience um you know I
[01:24:38] have to do the encoding and the
[01:24:40] memorization all at once which takes
[01:24:42] maybe a couple more I don't depends how
[01:24:45] well trained I am but it takes a little
[01:24:46] longer um and I will do a review
[01:24:48] immediately after here because I've
[01:24:51] written them out I've already kind of V
[01:24:53] envisioned them and and what I just did
[01:24:55] there is so fast because all I'm doing
[01:24:57] is seeing a picture and it's so powerful
[01:24:59] to just associate to the location which
[01:25:02] I've already gone through the location
[01:25:03] so the Memory Palace I know very not
[01:25:06] very well but well enough I know the
[01:25:07] general um pathway through it so now I'm
[01:25:12] going to try to recall it okay um I plan
[01:25:17] well I don't plan to but I I'm
[01:25:19] anticipating mistakes and that's part of
[01:25:21] the process right but this active recall
[01:25:23] is going to be super powerful in how it
[01:25:26] advances me here so I think for this
[01:25:30] round I think at the end I'm going to
[01:25:31] say it verbally um but for this round so
[01:25:34] I can get more feedback I'm going to use
[01:25:36] some software
[01:25:39] here uh let me pull this onto the screen
[01:25:42] here
[01:25:47] uh so memoriad uh is a pretty cool
[01:25:51] software it's kind of old and only works
[01:25:53] on PC so I've got a virtual um PC here
[01:25:57] um but it allows you to recall digits of
[01:26:01] e and pi and all that she is okay so
[01:26:07] um let's go I think it stops me if I
[01:26:10] wait too long to try to recall a digit
[01:26:13] so hopefully that doesn't
[01:26:14] happen
[01:26:16] but let's
[01:26:18] go um so 718 um Joe pesi is angry at an

[01:41:46] see couple mistakes
[01:41:49] here yes is on TV 998 not9 989 and then
[01:41:54] here Mel's playing is
[01:41:56] driving oh I meant to type a
[01:42:00] three okay cool riveting stuff I know um
[01:42:05] but that's the first thousand okay so
[01:42:08] I'm happy with that that feels pretty
[01:42:10] good the mistakes I made were some just
[01:42:14] typing errors that's nice uh and then
[01:42:17] some others I will have learned from
[01:42:20] okay
[01:42:21] so I am going
[01:42:23] [Music]
[01:42:26] to write out the next 125 locations and
[01:42:31] then um work on adding my
[01:42:36] images which I'm going to maybe do
[01:42:40] automatically for this round all right
[01:42:44] so give me a second
[01:42:47] here entering into the Dallas Wonderland
[01:42:49] yeah this is a bit strange um just quick
[01:42:52] questions here
[01:42:54] um Nelson do you use memory as a way to
[01:42:56] improve mindset do you visualize to
[01:42:58] improve outcomes I do I do yeah um you
[01:43:01] know this is a lot of visualization it's
[01:43:04] very intense visualization so obviously
[01:43:07] it's fictional um but it helps me in a
[01:43:10] way get a desired result which is to
[01:43:12] memorize something but I also do it for
[01:43:15] just kind of trying to manifest things
[01:43:17] in my own life um and you know before I
[01:43:19] try to perform uh or go on stage or or
[01:43:23] whatever you know I try to visualize the
[01:43:25] outcome that I want and um that really
[01:43:29] helps okay so 126 where are we going
[01:43:33] next we
[01:43:35] are uh so we're going to go up to 250
[01:43:41] here yeah let's see um let me see what I
[01:43:45] can do with
[01:43:47] my
[01:43:48] uh scripts that I've written here hold
[01:43:51] on one second
[01:44:20] all right hold on I'm going to run this
[01:44:22] um
[01:44:23] um and attach it
[01:44:26] to the rest of my images here of my
[01:44:30] locations which
[01:44:33] I've uh written out in another document
[01:44:39] here give me one second
[01:44:53] yeah if anyone's curious I'm taking
[01:44:57] um what I showed you before these
[01:45:02] files right these are all my numbers and
[01:45:05] I've just written a script that
[01:45:07] will um open up that file um split up
[01:45:14] the number from
[01:45:17] here and
[01:45:19] then uh just export it to another
[01:45:22] document
[01:45:23] all right I just have to run that right
[01:45:25] now give me one
[01:45:35] second this is the script by the
[01:45:40] way any
[01:45:43] cares nothing too fancy um all right
[01:45:47] hold on I'm just going to run that
[01:46:08] all right
[01:46:24] cool all right so hang on I only want
[01:46:28] after 125 here so I'm gonna copy and
[01:46:32] paste everything over here this is going
[01:46:33] to save so much time oh my
[01:46:35] god
[01:46:39] um all
[01:46:43] right look at
[01:46:48] that I even have more than I need Okay
[01:46:51] so
[01:46:53] cool um so these are the locations that
[01:46:57] uh I had from my other document and I
[01:46:59] spliced them with the images that were
[01:47:01] generated for um here based on those
[01:47:03] spreadsheets now the they're a little
[01:47:06] less
[01:47:07] descriptive um like ooso laughing double
[01:47:11] bun here so it's not as written out here
[01:47:14] but I know what these mean um so I think
[01:47:18] the next thing I want to do is look
[01:47:20] at the next th000 which if it was 125
[01:47:25] that should be up to 250
[01:47:29] here so this will take me to 2,000
[01:47:32] digits and then the rest here up to
[01:47:40] 340
[01:47:42] yeah this stuff I don't need even though
[01:47:46] that's digits
[01:47:48] passed um I did a few more just to be
[01:47:50] safe but um
[01:47:53] here we um let's
[01:47:57] see I think this one we only the last
[01:48:00] one only needs six digits of it right
[01:48:05] because it goes up
[01:48:06] to here but it doesn't matter I'm just
[01:48:09] going to memorize technically 2,720 all
[01:48:13] right but anyway so uh what this memory
[01:48:16] pal then goes to after going all through
[01:48:19] the town there is there's a little bit
[01:48:21] more of the town there's a couple like
[01:48:23] we go to a mall to shop for some last
[01:48:25] minute items then we go to the bank and
[01:48:27] then we go to the park gate of
[01:48:29] kilamanjaro the machame route if
[01:48:32] anybody's
[01:48:33] interested and then um yeah basically
[01:48:37] going through each Camp so this is going
[01:48:40] through the porter huts and the first
[01:48:42] gates to walk through the park the start
[01:48:45] of the route some spots where we ate
[01:48:48] lunch uh the first camp see1
[01:48:53] uh What It's Like on day two going up to
[01:48:55] Camp
[01:48:56] two
[01:48:57] um and so on and so
[01:49:01] on
[01:49:08] yeah cool all right so the thing I'm
[01:49:11] going to do here which is not the most
[01:49:13] exciting is I'm going to start
[01:49:14] memorizing these because they're already
[01:49:16] written for me um I just have to
[01:49:19] visualize them I don't even know the
[01:49:20] numbers I haven't looked at the numbers
[01:49:22] for these so um uh it may be a little
[01:49:25] trickier
[01:49:26] to encode because it's not us um I
[01:49:30] haven't seen it yet but um with my
[01:49:32] system I should be able to go back to it
[01:49:34] let me just make sure everybody's doing
[01:49:36] okay here in the
[01:49:38] chat
[01:49:42] um must have breaks yeah yeah it's
[01:49:46] tiring um what am I it's it's been
[01:49:49] almost two hours right um I may take a
[01:49:52] break in a little bit let me just try to
[01:49:54] encode this chunk and so we'll be
[01:49:57] sitting at 2,000
[01:49:58] digits that would be nice
[01:50:03] um am I Frozen
[01:50:07] Here how am I
[01:50:13] doing let me just make sure that
[01:50:15] everything is good in the
[01:50:16] chat in the
[01:50:19] Stream yeah okay I'm good all right um
[01:50:22] so I'm going to do this uh I am tired
[01:50:24] but um let's let's pull through man
[01:50:27] we're not halfway there but we're almost
[01:50:29] halfway there okay so I'm just going
[01:50:31] to um should I put some some tunes maybe
[01:50:35] I should put some tunes I'm gonna put
[01:50:36] some
[01:50:39] tunes give me a
[01:50:43] second some royaltyfree tunes otherwise
[01:50:47] I get in
[01:50:49] trouble um
[01:50:54] do Sunny Day jazz how about
[01:50:58] that no no
[01:51:02] thanks um let's do I want some like oh
[01:51:05] you know what I'll just find some um Loi
[01:51:08] study Beats
[01:51:24] perfect now it's not going to be super
[01:51:26] loud because it's through the Audio
[01:51:28] Mic but
[01:51:34] anyways all right so here I
[01:51:51] go for
[01:52:51] SC e
[01:53:51] Che e
[01:54:51] for
[01:55:21] e for
[01:56:21] feel for
[01:57:06] statue
[01:57:34] all right let me go through this one
[01:57:36] more
[01:57:37] time bit faster here
[01:58:14] this a very light-hearted zip through of
[01:58:17] a
[01:58:18] review I think I'm going to look at the
[01:58:20] numbers just to kind of connect them all
[01:58:22] a bit
[01:58:43] better all right so I need to go to a
[01:58:46] thousand so let me
[01:58:50] just script isn't perfect I got to go
[01:58:52] through all these digits just by holding
[01:58:54] the right arrow I can't just select one
[01:58:57] or jump down unfortunately but that's a
[01:59:00] feature I need to add later this website
[01:59:01] is just really created for today it's
[01:59:04] purpose
[01:59:09] only hi Alonso debella how are
[01:59:13] you thanks for those watching right now
[01:59:16] I know this is the most thrilling part
[01:59:17] the probably the most exciting part will
[01:59:19] be when I actually recite all of it or
[01:59:21] as many as I can
[01:59:23] um but we're getting there in theory I
[01:59:26] have 2,000 digits
[01:59:29] um pretty much there the first thousand
[01:59:31] I had mostly there a few mistakes um I'm
[01:59:35] in the process of encoding the next
[01:59:37] thousand so uh once we have the 2,000
[01:59:40] the last
[01:59:42] 700 not too daunting I don't
[01:59:47] think one thing that does happen though
[01:59:49] obviously the beginning is easy because
[01:59:50] everything's fresh there's nothing
[01:59:51] you've memorize so it's all novel but as
[01:59:54] you start to add more and more and more
[01:59:56] uh it does get harder naturally because
[01:59:59] you know that's a lot of
[02:00:03] information okay so this is starting
[02:00:05] from what we just uh looked at the
[02:00:07] second chunk here so I'm just trying to
[02:00:11] visualize the images that go with these
[02:00:13] numbers not that I don't know them but
[02:00:14] it'll some of
[02:00:16] them I don't know I just need to see the
[02:00:18] number just uh to make sense of it and
[02:00:20] it's also a way to review because I can
[02:00:21] say the image as I read it so Brian's
[02:00:23] being crucified by a scar oinko is

[02:01:29] um flare
[02:01:33] dribbling ice creams wrestling
[02:01:42] mop guitar with
[02:01:56] someone's asking uh is it possible to
[02:01:57] memorize 100 plus digits in a short span
[02:01:59] of time without any memory techniques
[02:02:01] just Brute Force I saw one of my friends
[02:02:03] do it for sure yeah I mean um it really
[02:02:07] depends how you go about it
[02:02:08] but you know you can make a song out of
[02:02:11] it you can try to look at the numbers
[02:02:12] and see if they have some kind of
[02:02:14] meaningful pattern you know it's hard to
[02:02:16] say without memory techniques because
[02:02:19] whatever your friend is doing is a
[02:02:21] memory technique you know just by
[02:02:23] definition but it's not maybe a number
[02:02:26] system or like a Memory Palace you can
[02:02:28] totally do that um the idea though with
[02:02:30] this is
[02:02:31] that while it may take longer to set up
[02:02:34] it will last longer um you know
[02:02:37] potentially the technique your friend
[02:02:39] used you know if you ask him in a year
[02:02:41] from now if you remember the numbers
[02:02:42] maybe he doesn't I don't maybe he does I
[02:02:44] don't know um but stuff like this using
[02:02:46] Memory Palace will lend itself to being
[02:02:49] easier to review and to keep forever
[02:02:54] potentially all right uh let me keep

[02:26:12] 2,000 in the bag more or less all right
[02:26:16] so to answer elr's carbon question here
[02:26:18] I suspect my friend visualized as 100
[02:26:20] plus digits as he can recite any nth
[02:26:23] digit from the sequence and can tell
[02:26:25] them backwards maybe just good
[02:26:29] visualization um
[02:26:31] honestly I would bet quite a lot of
[02:26:35] money that he actually is using a system
[02:26:37] even if he says he isn't um because to
[02:26:40] say well it depends how quickly he can
[02:26:43] access the position digit if he has to
[02:26:46] think about it then he might just be
[02:26:48] counting and then doing it backwards if
[02:26:50] he does it slowly it's possible but if
[02:26:53] it's fast like what's the 45th number if
[02:26:56] you can do that real quick that's a very
[02:26:58] Telltale sign that he is using a system
[02:27:01] but hey man uh some people can do stuff
[02:27:04] like this uh it's very rare but it is
[02:27:08] possible thanks for sharing that I
[02:27:10] appreciate that I'll like that um next
[02:27:12] video on solving 25 differential
[02:27:15] equations yeah
[02:27:17] sure all right cool uh so we sit at
[02:27:20] 2,000 numbers I think the next thing
[02:27:23] I'll do is let's let me try to just
[02:27:27] finish up and
[02:27:28] memorize or at least get these
[02:27:31] encoded these last ones
[02:27:34] here and
[02:27:37] uh and then we'll just go for it um you
[02:27:41] know I want to finish this up by
[02:27:43] one uh something like that so let me
[02:27:47] just put my head down and try to rec uh
[02:27:51] memorize these ones these last
[02:27:57] 718 RVA asks did you make a new set of
[02:28:00] people action places no these are not
[02:28:03] new these are ones I've had for a long
[02:28:06] time um up here somebody asks when you
[02:28:09] memorize your images do you shorten your
[02:28:11] images names syllables in your head like
[02:28:13] Sylvester the cat yeah that's a good
[02:28:16] point um I write it out longer here but
[02:28:19] in my head um um I'm really saying Sly
[02:28:23] yeah or sill yeah but honestly even
[02:28:26] faster than that is just to picture the
[02:28:27] picture right don't even say the thing
[02:28:30] um I'm not great at that but people who
[02:28:31] are faster than I they do that they get
[02:28:34] rid of the sub vocalization and they
[02:28:36] just see the
[02:28:41] picture all right so let's do this and
[02:28:43] then maybe I'll take a little break uh
[02:28:45] for a few minutes and then I'll come
[02:28:47] back and and we'll pound this out
[02:28:50] all right so here I go
[02:29:38] I like this
[02:29:49] song
[02:30:18] for
[02:30:48] e
[02:31:18] for
[02:31:48] for
[02:32:18] e for
[02:33:48] for
[02:34:18] e
[02:34:48] for
[02:35:18] for
[02:35:48] for
[02:36:18] for e
[02:37:09] okay all right so first pass I can feel
[02:37:13] the stuff adding up so this this wasn't
[02:37:15] my best pass um I think I might go go
[02:37:20] here and try
[02:37:22] to doesn't look like much it's almost
[02:37:25] there okay but let me go through this
[02:37:27] now then I think I'll take a
[02:37:30] break yeah and then we'll come back and
[02:37:32] Hammer out the recital of it
[02:37:36] all hopefully I can get it
[02:37:38] perfect um all right

[03:07:23] so looking at some of these uh in the
[03:07:25] comments less people watching now that's
[03:07:28] understandable this has been very
[03:07:30] slow um incredible endurance though I
[03:07:33] can barely practice for more than 20
[03:07:34] minutes before I get distracted yeah I
[03:07:35] mean I'm deep into this does not feel
[03:07:37] like I started three and a quarter hours
[03:07:42] ago um but yeah um
[03:07:48] distracted you know what I
[03:07:50] um I think I'm just going to go for it
[03:07:53] um I need to get my
[03:07:56] blindfold we're going to turn off the
[03:07:58] music and then I'm just going to go
[03:08:00] through the site here and do the magic
[03:08:03] and see how far we get and if we [ __ ] up
[03:08:06] we [ __ ] up you know the goal let me
[03:08:08] reset this
[03:08:10] actually the goal is to obviously break
[03:08:13] the record um we'll see how I feel if I
[03:08:17] fail um obviously it's going to be up to
[03:08:19] the chat here to tell me if I made a
[03:08:21] mistake um I'm going to be blindfolded
[03:08:24] so I won't know that for sure um but the
[03:08:27] point of being blindfolded is and no ear
[03:08:30] pieces anything uh is so that it's clear
[03:08:33] that I'm actually doing this with no
[03:08:46] help for
[03:09:39] um I am trying to find
[03:09:44] my blindfold
[03:09:55] um I will be right back okay I'm going
[03:09:57] to take a small break and
[03:10:03] uh yeah I will be right back let me up
[03:10:06] update this for a
[03:10:16] second e
[03:10:50] testing testing all right yeah so uh I'm
[03:10:53] going to take a break uh five minutes
[03:10:55] and I'll be right back I got to find I
[03:10:57] got to take a p and then um uh yeah I'll
[03:11:01] be right
[03:11:03] back and find my uh what do you call it
[03:11:16] blindfold
[03:11:46] e
[03:12:16] e
[03:12:17] [Music]
[03:12:46] for
[03:13:16] e
[03:13:46] for e
[03:14:36] all right we are back I found the
[03:14:40] blindfold so
[03:14:44] um yeah I think uh before I actually
[03:14:47] physically really finally do this um I'm
[03:14:51] gonna take a quick review of everything
[03:14:54] real quick um again I want to thanks my
[03:14:57] thank my sponsor mind lab Pro um I use
[03:15:00] this product every day honestly um I've
[03:15:03] always taken a supplement for my brain
[03:15:05] um used to be specifically uh DHA
[03:15:09] omega3 um which is great uh and that is
[03:15:12] in there but uh I was introduced to this
[03:15:16] product a few years ago
[03:15:17] and fell in love with it and um it
[03:15:19] really helps me uh feel sharper when I'm
[03:15:23] on it and uh I highly recommend it now
[03:15:25] there are plenty of other neut Tropics
[03:15:28] out there so um what I recommend is not
[03:15:31] to just blindly take my advice but um do
[03:15:34] your research um because neut Tropics is
[03:15:37] a blend of things that are there to help
[03:15:42] your memory your focus your attention
[03:15:44] span whatever your sex drive whatever
[03:15:47] some have different mixtures or
[03:15:49] concoctions so uh and the research on
[03:15:52] some of them is kind of up in the air
[03:15:55] right um You don't know what kind of
[03:15:57] stimulants or whatever you're putting in
[03:15:59] your body so do your own research thing
[03:16:02] I like about mind lab Pro is they do a
[03:16:04] lot of um they're very honest uh I
[03:16:07] believe in my opinion with what they put
[03:16:10] in there um there's some research
[03:16:13] backing to what they have in there um
[03:16:16] you know some people people might fight
[03:16:17] me on that that it's not uh valid but I
[03:16:21] I believe it's it's valid enough I mean
[03:16:23] in this day and age what what is real uh
[03:16:26] when it comes to that stuff anyways um
[03:16:29] but I've done a lot of research over the
[03:16:31] years of each individual ingredient and
[03:16:34] I believe in it and I've had experience
[03:16:36] individually with each each of those so
[03:16:38] mixing them together in this neut Tropic
[03:16:40] stack makes sense to me and anyways it's
[03:16:43] a bit pricier than some of the others
[03:16:45] although some others are even more
[03:16:47] expensive but I think it's at the right
[03:16:48] spot um so yeah give it a check out and
[03:16:53] uh I will shut up about the
[03:16:55] sponsor um what else here all right
[03:17:01] so let's see it's
[03:17:04] 12:20 here I hope to wrap up I don't
[03:17:08] think I'm going to get this on the first
[03:17:09] try I'm gonna be honest I'm probably
[03:17:11] going to make a mistake a digit or an
[03:17:13] image I miscon convert um especially at
[03:17:16] the end was a bit
[03:17:20] um a bit not fuzzy I don't want to say
[03:17:23] but like
[03:17:26] um not as clear I think because I'm just
[03:17:30] kind of exhausted honestly
[03:17:33] um so let me um go through all of this
[03:17:37] one last time just kind of
[03:17:43] quickly this first one I feel really
[03:17:45] good about the first thousand honestly
[03:17:46] honestly that one doesn't bother me at
[03:17:49] all again the mistakes are probably
[03:17:51] going to come if I just accidentally say
[03:17:53] the wrong image uh
[03:18:00] translation speak louder okay sorry I
[03:18:03] will speak louder
[03:18:09] um is my I feel like my levels
[03:18:13] are yeah I mean I don't know
[03:18:45] anyways
[03:19:15] e
[03:19:45] for
[03:20:15] for
[03:20:45] e for
[03:22:08] sorry just going through this uh making
[03:22:11] sure I have it and then we're going to
[03:22:12] go it's go time almost done
[03:22:15] here
[03:22:45] for e
[03:23:41] all right okay so let me turn off this
[03:23:45] hip hop although maybe it's helpful I
[03:23:46] don't know I'll put a
[03:23:50] lower all right so the way this is going
[03:23:52] to work is I have
[03:23:56] this at some point why I should maybe
[03:23:58] make this smaller yes so all can be seen
[03:24:01] here in one can I make this full screen
[03:24:04] no I
[03:24:06] cannot all right so I'm going to put my
[03:24:09] blindfold on
[03:24:22] the idea is if I can find my place
[03:24:26] here so I'm on the first digit here so
[03:24:29] as I say the digits so
[03:24:34] um so
[03:24:38] 78 uh
[03:24:42] 2882 right so you get the idea
[03:24:46] so you guys can follow along all right
[03:24:49] so let's just go into it all right um I
[03:24:52] won't be able to see anything so if I
[03:24:54] make a mistake I won't even know until
[03:24:57] the end so um wish me
[03:25:02] luck and uh yeah we'll see what happens
[03:25:04] when I'm through this um whatever let's
[03:25:09] just go for
[03:25:10] it all right you Oilers number actually
[03:25:14] let me turn turn off the music
[03:25:23] all right here we
[03:25:25] go I yes the arrow key okay all right so
[03:25:29] Oilers number

[03:54:04] 61085 and then uh
[03:54:08] 263
[03:54:11] 98139 I believe that's 2000 hopefully I
[03:54:13] didn't skip anything or get anything
[03:54:15] wrong feels good but of course you know
[03:54:19] we'll see after okay the final 718 let's
[03:54:22] see if I can get there these were the
[03:54:23] tricky
[03:54:24] ones uh for me for whatever reason um
[03:54:27] and if I [ __ ] up or get stuck then
[03:54:30] that's the end okay all right so
[03:54:32] continuing on we
[03:54:39] have 5 five9

[03:56:10] Juggernaut there's three digits and then
[03:56:13] there's
[03:56:16] 97482 all right I gotta think about this
[03:56:19] because I I'm not it's not coming to me
[03:56:20] but I gotta search my numbers for
[03:56:23] it
[03:56:28] um who's dragging them up there
[03:56:56] I keep seeing Joe pesi which is 718 but
[03:56:58] that's what I said last time and it was
[03:57:00] wrong um and I tried to correct
[03:57:05] myself um
[03:57:36] just going through the numbers in my
[03:57:37] head see if it jogs my
[03:57:43] memory for
[03:58:25] brother

[03:59:32] is
[03:59:33] it one of the Seinfeld characters
[03:59:42] no have to skip this and make maybe
[03:59:44] it'll come back but I'm going to have a
[03:59:45] hole there at least I made it past 2,000

[04:56:03] two um
[04:56:06] yeah let me see if I can remember
[04:56:10] what was he opening the fridge to and
[04:56:12] then what was that I missed two images
[04:56:14] completely
[04:56:18] there opening
[04:56:24] fridge I don't know it's not going to
[04:56:26] come to me let's just stop
[04:56:31] there all right
[04:56:41] all right so I'll have to watch back um
[04:56:46] I don't know if I skipped some
[04:56:48] images but
[04:56:50] uh last two columns of row 17 last two
[04:56:53] columns of row 17 were Miss let me see 1
[04:56:58] two three four five six seven8 nine 10
[04:57:02] 11 12 13 14 15 16
[04:57:06] 17 uh
[04:57:12] oh yeah oh
[04:57:14] man
[04:57:18] yep I believe I said these but then I
[04:57:20] forgot I forgot those yeah
[04:57:24] [ __ ] all right
[04:57:29] so let me see 0 five Z
[04:57:38] 57 oh yeah
[04:57:59] okay I want to see the ones that I got
[04:58:03] incorrect here let's see
[04:58:13] oh and this was supposed to be 50 come
[04:58:15] on
[04:58:17] now yeah I said 850 there it's 050 for
[04:58:21] this
[04:58:22] one um and then this one was space
[04:58:25] walking with MTO so it should have been
[04:58:29] 239 91 490 and then what was the opening
[04:58:33] of the fridge here a
[04:58:36] rhino 799 dang
[04:58:41] and then of course I missed those two
[04:58:43] locations which I can tell you what they
[04:58:44] are now it's nine uh
[04:58:47] 092
[04:58:50] 62 264 and then
[04:58:54] 832
[04:58:58] uh
[04:59:00] 62 779
[04:59:07] damn all right what do you guys think
[04:59:10] should I should I try this again should
[04:59:12] I just accept my losses and maybe come
[04:59:14] back from
[04:59:15] another
[04:59:18] um do it another time what do you
[04:59:23] think I don't want to fail
[04:59:26] right
[04:59:28] uh did I make any other
[04:59:30] mistakes let me
[04:59:38] see two lines got got
[04:59:46] skipped I think he means the two
[04:59:49] columns
[04:59:54] uh yeah yeah okay I just missed these
[04:59:56] two got it uh 092 yeah yeah those two
[05:00:01] columns were missed 16
[05:00:03] digits that makes sense because I was 16
[05:00:05] behind right
[05:00:08] um okay
[05:00:13] and then I made the mistake later on I
[05:00:15] skip i w I missed the one where he's
[05:00:17] opening the fridge to a
[05:00:20] rhino
[05:00:29] uh
[05:00:34] yeah I should use your demonstration for
[05:00:37] something meaningful and useful instead
[05:00:39] of memorizing in some numbers honestly
[05:00:41] to me this is uh meaningful and useful
[05:00:43] so um I'd be curious what you uh find
[05:00:48] meaningful and useful um
[05:00:53] 953
[05:00:54] 74 yeah yeah yeah but I corrected myself
[05:00:57] on that one um
[05:00:59] 953 74152 yeah I said it was
[05:01:04] 780 uh 361 192 but that came
[05:01:08] later um
[05:01:15] all
[05:01:19] right let me do a poll should I try one
[05:01:23] more time now
[05:01:41] oh I don't want to but I I I kind of do
[05:01:43] um what I might do is I'm G
[05:01:47] to Oh I said a 939 instead of
[05:01:50] 839
[05:01:54] uh I wonder where I would have done
[05:01:58] that oh I see yeah oh yeah yeah yeah
[05:02:00] yeah at the end that's right it's it's
[05:02:03] rayu which is
[05:02:04] 839 I said 939 which is M by uh which is
[05:02:08] Ken okay I got to remember remember that
[05:02:16] um I can't create new room for the
[05:02:21] lines well the the ones that I skipped
[05:02:24] are there uh just when I was going
[05:02:26] through my memory Palace I skipped those
[05:02:28] locations it's still a relatively new
[05:02:30] Memory Palace so it's not so super
[05:02:32] ingrained um so let's see
[05:02:36] here
[05:02:38] 90% uh 20 votes 90% say I should try it
[05:02:41] again all right I'm going to go get a
[05:02:44] quick snack and a drink and I'm going to
[05:02:46] try this one more [ __ ] time and uh
[05:02:48] hopefully I get it uh or at least go
[05:02:50] pretty far um but I do want to take a
[05:02:55] couple minutes what is it it's
[05:02:57] 207 okay all right I will be back in a
[05:03:00] few
[05:03:01] minutes let me put a note here see y all

[05:06:52] me saying all the numbers and that'll
[05:06:58] be its own thing I'd like to have a
[05:07:01] demonstration that I started from
[05:07:03] scratch that I was able to
[05:07:06] successfully uh memorize in one sitting

[05:41:58] fine all right
[05:42:01] so I don't know did I do it did I make
[05:42:05] mistakes anybody can anybody tell me
[05:42:14] there oh Ian tells me I made a mistake
[05:42:17] six across nine
[05:42:20] down
[05:42:23] 568 oh yeah ah dang okay 07 yeah I said
[05:42:28] z z that's yeah 533
[05:42:34] 58 is it 5'8 I said 98
[05:42:38] uh
[05:42:40] 533 58048 and then Ian so six
[05:42:46] across one two three four five six nine
[05:42:50] down one two three four five six S8
[05:43:00] n uh I don't think I said that wrong but
[05:43:04] it could be um
[05:43:09] yeah that's okay I'm happy with that I
[05:43:12] may do another uh separate take and just
[05:43:16] release that as its own video um but
[05:43:19] I'll have to look back and see where I
[05:43:20] actually got to before my first mistake
[05:43:22] and then that will be my uh record that
[05:43:24] I submit but um thank you all for
[05:43:27] watching me this was quite
[05:43:30] exhausting

=== Talking Brain Health w/ Neurosurgeon Sanjay Gupta (Interview) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYcQ4wqqGSA

[00:00:00] I got a chance to sit down with the
[00:00:02] famed Sanjay Gupta Dr Sanjay Gupta most
[00:00:05] of you may know him from CNN I know him
[00:00:08] because he's a good friend of mine and
[00:00:09] he was so nice enough to do the forward
[00:00:11] to my book remember it I have it
[00:00:15] somewhere here hold
[00:00:18] on here we go if you haven't read this
[00:00:21] book uh this is my book remember I came
[00:00:23] out Jesus uh 6 years agooo it's time for
[00:00:26] a new one anyways he did the forward to
[00:00:28] my book really awesome because he is a
[00:00:30] neurosurgeon knows a lot about brain
[00:00:32] health talks a lot about Alzheimer's
[00:00:34] disease which is really important to me
[00:00:36] if you know my story then you know why
[00:00:39] but anyways this is a conversation I had
[00:00:40] with him just a couple weeks ago I hope
[00:00:42] you
[00:00:43] enjoy welcome here we have Sanji Gupta
[00:00:47] uh a good friend of mine we've we've
[00:00:48] done a couple things together in in the
[00:00:51] memory space but uh you're most
[00:00:53] well-known for your connections to CNN
[00:00:56] um you're a neurosurgeon um at Emery and
[00:00:59] thank you for joining me for a little
[00:01:00] interview here I've been looking forward
[00:01:02] to this thanks for having me Nelson I
[00:01:04] think um just for a bit of background
[00:01:06] for anybody watching this um Sanji and I
[00:01:08] did a little um episode together on CNN
[00:01:12] this was what 2017 maybe something like
[00:01:15] that you're the you're the memory guy so
[00:01:17] I'll take your word on it it's funny
[00:01:20] it's confusing now because I get so many
[00:01:22] people still it hasn't re happened
[00:01:24] recently but once in a while I'll be
[00:01:26] like oh I saw you in the airport on TV
[00:01:29] and I'm just like it's got to be the CNN
[00:01:31] thing and usually they replayed it um
[00:01:34] but anyways I we met in Atlanta at some
[00:01:36] really pretty home the Swan House yes
[00:01:39] and uh I basically taught you a Memory
[00:01:41] Palace technique and we walked around
[00:01:43] and I taught you some presidents do you
[00:01:45] remember that oh yeah no it's it's funny
[00:01:48] how many years have passed and I still
[00:01:51] um I can Envision that room so so
[00:01:54] clearly still which is which is kind of
[00:01:56] amazing cuz I can't remember what I had
[00:01:57] for breakfast yesterday
[00:02:00] that stuff sticks with you um but it was
[00:02:02] a it was a memorable day and then you
[00:02:03] also wrote my uh forward to my book
[00:02:06] remember it uh very appreciative of that
[00:02:09] um my my proudest kind of achievement
[00:02:12] that I can hold in my hand so I'm I'm
[00:02:14] very excited that you're on that no it's
[00:02:16] it's it's it's my pleasure I really
[00:02:18] admire the work that you do um and and I
[00:02:20] think you know teaching people about
[00:02:23] something that is of so such big concern
[00:02:26] to them you know that's that's one thing
[00:02:27] I think that came up even since we spoke
[00:02:30] is if you ask people about one of their
[00:02:32] greatest fears especially as they get
[00:02:34] older and I'm getting older um much
[00:02:36] older than you it's memory and um so I I
[00:02:40] I thought that was really instructive
[00:02:42] and helpful what we went through so I
[00:02:45] wanted to start with kind of your story
[00:02:47] you know how your interest in the brain
[00:02:50] came about uh why you decided to be a
[00:02:53] neurosurgeon in the first place and how
[00:02:54] you ended up you know as such a front
[00:02:58] media facing person uh expert in that
[00:03:02] field yeah you know it's it's um I I may
[00:03:05] maybe like a lot of people's story is a
[00:03:06] little bit of
[00:03:08] serendipity uh baked into there but I
[00:03:11] I'm I'm a doctor I I've always been
[00:03:13] interested in health care when I was
[00:03:15] doing my neurosurgery training I got
[00:03:17] very interested in healthc care policy
[00:03:19] as well as my clinical training and
[00:03:21] ultimately was doing a lot of writing
[00:03:23] worked at the white house for a while um
[00:03:26] primarily on domestic policy issues and
[00:03:28] speech writing around
[00:03:30] Healthcare and I think it was the first
[00:03:32] time I sort of understood um messaging
[00:03:35] uh in in a different way because a lot
[00:03:37] of what we do in in medicine is write
[00:03:39] for peerreview journals and that was
[00:03:41] that was most of my life most of my sort
[00:03:43] of academic life uh writing speeches for
[00:03:46] the president and the first lady kind of
[00:03:48] gave me a different sense of things and
[00:03:50] really learning how to do that
[00:03:51] ultimately I moved to Atlanta to take a
[00:03:53] job at Emery as you mentioned and that's
[00:03:56] also the headquarters of CNN they asked
[00:04:00] me um because they knew of my work at
[00:04:02] the White House they asked if I would
[00:04:04] consider doing commentary on CNN
[00:04:07] primarily around healthc care policy
[00:04:09] Nelson uh that was the original thing
[00:04:12] inter and that was August of 2001 and
[00:04:15] then 3 and a half weeks after I started
[00:04:17] u 911 happened and everybody's World
[00:04:21] changed um my world changed as well and
[00:04:24] they basically said look we're probably
[00:04:26] not going to be doing Healthcare policy
[00:04:28] for for a while but now you're a doctor
[00:04:30] working at an international news network
[00:04:33] in the midst of what is unfolding in the
[00:04:35] world um what do you think about
[00:04:37] reporting on some of that covering some
[00:04:39] of that and I found it really
[00:04:41] interesting so all of a sudden I went
[00:04:43] from healthc care policy person that was
[00:04:45] going to do Sunday morning shows to
[00:04:47] Anthrax to Afghanistan covering the wars
[00:04:50] in Iraq and then basically every
[00:04:53] conflict and every natural disaster
[00:04:55] that's happened in the world over the
[00:04:56] last quarter Century roughly uh I've
[00:04:58] covered and and it was that's the
[00:05:01] Serendipity part of it what is uh and
[00:05:03] what what was your kind of growing up I
[00:05:07] mean did you always know you'd be doing
[00:05:10] something medical related to the brain
[00:05:13] or were you always fascinated with the
[00:05:14] brain or that's kind of where you found
[00:05:17] yourself you know I it's interesting I
[00:05:19] think I think the answer to both those
[00:05:21] things is yes I was always fascinated
[00:05:22] with the brain but I didn't necessarily
[00:05:24] see myself as a as a brain surgeon or or
[00:05:27] a brain doctor uh um there's nobody in
[00:05:30] my family who's a doctor so there there
[00:05:32] was no sort of I had no context for that
[00:05:36] I did decide I wanted to go into
[00:05:37] medicine at a pretty young age um but
[00:05:40] originally I thought I was going to go
[00:05:41] into Pediatrics I that was the only
[00:05:43] doctor I really knew my own pediatrician
[00:05:45] and I love my pediatrician so I thought
[00:05:47] that's what I was going to do I did a
[00:05:50] rotation in medical school uh in
[00:05:53] neurosurgery and I think that's when I
[00:05:56] really got hooked I had had family
[00:05:58] members who had dealt with brain
[00:06:00] problems um family member with
[00:06:02] Alzheimer's family member who had had
[00:06:04] Strokes so I I was fascinated by the
[00:06:07] brain in that regard just listening to
[00:06:10] what had happened to them and how their
[00:06:12] brains had worked or not worked but it
[00:06:15] wasn't until I really did that rotation
[00:06:17] in medical school that I got pretty
[00:06:19] hooked on it yeah and you know I uh I
[00:06:22] read your book uh it's been a few years
[00:06:24] since it's been out now keep sharp right
[00:06:26] when did that come out uh 2021 I was
[00:06:29] just after Co okay yeah um and so you
[00:06:32] know to me those who know my story has
[00:06:35] to do with Alzheimer's as well my
[00:06:36] grandmother yes struggled with it and
[00:06:39] that kind of set me off on this journey
[00:06:40] to improve my own memory had that not
[00:06:42] have happened in our family I don't know
[00:06:44] if if I'd even be sitting here talking
[00:06:46] to you about this today which is kind of
[00:06:48] wild um so your connection to
[00:06:52] alzheimer's is really you know you've
[00:06:54] kind of seen through family members and
[00:06:56] friends the impact of that yeah I think
[00:06:59] I I think that's that's a lot of it and
[00:07:01] and then certainly when you're a
[00:07:02] clinician in this area you know as a as
[00:07:05] a neuro doctor you do come across a lot
[00:07:08] of patients I don't you know there's no
[00:07:10] surgical sort of therapy for Alzheimer's
[00:07:12] but you there's a lot of crossover in
[00:07:14] the patients that we see and and um you
[00:07:17] know did neurology rotations a lot of
[00:07:19] times patients are seen by neurologist
[00:07:21] first so I I the brain is fascinating to
[00:07:26] me um you know it's 3 and2 pounds of
[00:07:29] tissue and it's so enigmatic you know
[00:07:32] every every as you know we talked about
[00:07:34] this but every joy every every
[00:07:36] aspiration every love that you've had in
[00:07:39] your life is all stored there and that's
[00:07:40] still mystifying but I think what is
[00:07:42] interesting from a physician standpoint
[00:07:45] is is when things don't go right when
[00:07:49] there's a problem it often times
[00:07:51] provides you tremendous insights into
[00:07:53] the brain as well so I think that as I
[00:07:56] started to practice more and more as I
[00:07:58] you know was in my training training
[00:07:59] seven years um you're just so immersed
[00:08:02] in it that every aspect of what's
[00:08:05] happening with the brain is of interest
[00:08:08] and and Alzheimer's uh and a few other
[00:08:10] things but Alzheimer's in particular was
[00:08:12] a big part of that and so when you wrote
[00:08:14] that book um great advice in there um
[00:08:19] what well I guess I I want to ask you
[00:08:21] what are your your just because not
[00:08:23] everybody's maybe read it um but what
[00:08:25] would be your advice uh you know we can
[00:08:27] start general um advice for maintaining
[00:08:30] brain health as you age um whether
[00:08:33] that's your memory or your problem
[00:08:36] solving skills or just your alertness
[00:08:38] sharpness all these things you know we
[00:08:40] don't really think much about how to
[00:08:43] maintain that we think about our bodies
[00:08:46] what we put in our bodies exercise and
[00:08:48] stuff but we don't really focus on the
[00:08:50] mind and I think that's changing now at
[00:08:52] least that's what I've been trying to
[00:08:53] change you know people like yourself as
[00:08:55] well are are rewriting that uh
[00:08:57] relationship people have with their
[00:08:59] brain brain health but what is your your
[00:09:01] kind of general advice to maintain brain
[00:09:04] health well you know I I think the
[00:09:05] Topline thing that you said I think is
[00:09:07] is is really important just as a
[00:09:09] starting point I I think that up until
[00:09:12] recently within the last couple of
[00:09:14] decades the idea that we could even
[00:09:16] address brain health uh that was not
[00:09:19] something that was widely considered
[00:09:21] even even in the medical establishment
[00:09:24] um kind of you got what you got your
[00:09:26] brain did what it did and that was it it
[00:09:29] was it was this black box sitting in
[00:09:31] your skull and in some ways Nelson I
[00:09:34] would liken it to how we thought about
[00:09:36] heart disease you know going back to the
[00:09:38] middle of the last century I think
[00:09:40] before the Framingham study which is a
[00:09:42] famous study on heart disease before
[00:09:43] that came out people thought look
[00:09:45] grandfather had it his his father had it
[00:09:48] I'm going to get heart disease that's
[00:09:49] just the way that it goes and I think
[00:09:51] now there is a widely accepted and and
[00:09:55] well sort of substantiated belief that
[00:09:57] there are things you can do to
[00:10:00] really reduce if not eliminate your risk
[00:10:03] of heart
[00:10:04] disease and that's fantastic it's still
[00:10:07] a problem in this country but if you
[00:10:09] were diligent about actually taking care
[00:10:11] of your heart there's a good chance you
[00:10:13] would never have a heart problem per se
[00:10:16] you wouldn't have a heart attack it's
[00:10:17] not pre-ordained that is where we're at
[00:10:20] the nent stages of thinking the same way
[00:10:22] about the brain so there are many things
[00:10:25] that you can do to maintain brain health
[00:10:27] it's not pre-ordained that you're going
[00:10:28] to just lose memory that you're going to
[00:10:30] develop cognitive dysfunction all these
[00:10:32] sort of things as you get older and a
[00:10:35] lot of the same things that uh worked
[00:10:38] for heart health are also beneficial for
[00:10:40] the brain as a general rule what is good
[00:10:42] for the heart is good for the brain but
[00:10:44] not entirely either um and that's where
[00:10:48] I spent a lot of time in in the book
[00:10:50] like what is it that actually
[00:10:51] constitutes brain health by the way I
[00:10:53] could ask you this as a memory person
[00:10:56] versus a neurologist and might get to
[00:10:58] two totally different answers
[00:10:59] true it's it's probably not memory as as
[00:11:03] you well know it's probably more your
[00:11:05] ability to to have significant cognitive
[00:11:08] Reserve so that you know the same life
[00:11:11] events that might one person
[00:11:14] could actually strengthen your brain you
[00:11:16] know and I think that's a lot of what
[00:11:17] brain health is but if if there if the
[00:11:22] if you're looking at the evidence around
[00:11:24] brain health the thing that probably has
[00:11:26] the most substantial evidence has little
[00:11:29] to do with crossword puzzles and soduku
[00:11:32] and things like that and much more to do
[00:11:34] with something else you're very good at
[00:11:35] which is physical activity and the
[00:11:38] physical activity um there's there's all
[00:11:41] these mechanisms that have now been
[00:11:43] described that show you make something
[00:11:46] known as bdnf brain derived neurotrophic
[00:11:49] Factor as a prominent neuroscientists
[00:11:52] called it it's sort of like the Miracle
[00:11:54] Grow for the brain you can't inject it
[00:11:57] you can't eat it you can't supplement it
[00:11:59] you can make it and the best way to make
[00:12:01] it is through physical exercise or
[00:12:03] physical movement I should say but what
[00:12:05] is interesting um and I think you'll
[00:12:07] find this interesting is
[00:12:09] that with heart health you want to get
[00:12:11] that that intense activity uh that seems
[00:12:15] to be the most beneficial the problem
[00:12:17] when you do intense activity for the
[00:12:20] brain is that you're also releasing a
[00:12:21] lot of cortisol a lot of stress hormone
[00:12:24] and so you're making the bdnf but you're
[00:12:26] also inhibiting the bdnf because of the
[00:12:29] stress hormone so moderate activity ends
[00:12:33] up being better for the brain whereas
[00:12:34] intense activity may be better for the
[00:12:37] heart um and and you can find these
[00:12:40] these sort of differentiations in all
[00:12:43] these different aspects of our lifestyle
[00:12:45] when you eat a lot of sugar for example
[00:12:47] we know that's bad nobody argues with
[00:12:49] that but the body will store that sugar
[00:12:52] as energy as fat and because that's how
[00:12:56] the bodies are designed but what's
[00:12:57] interesting about the brain is that if
[00:12:58] you ra the blood glucose level uh after
[00:13:02] a certain point a pretty narrow window
[00:13:05] The receptors in the brain will just
[00:13:06] sort of shut off it won't absorb
[00:13:08] anything which means that you could be
[00:13:10] stuffing your body and starving your
[00:13:12] brain at the same time so too much sugar
[00:13:15] is particularly problematic for your
[00:13:16] brain it's why little kids have crashes
[00:13:19] when when they eat too much sugar so I'm
[00:13:21] just giving you a couple of examples but
[00:13:23] I think the the the basic message is
[00:13:26] that if you continue to use your brain
[00:13:29] if you continue to develop new neurons
[00:13:32] by being physically active in the ways
[00:13:33] that I described and you're not damaging
[00:13:35] it through diet and other things you're
[00:13:38] likely to be able to have a brain that
[00:13:42] lasts your lifetime I mean it's the one
[00:13:44] organ I think in the body that can
[00:13:46] actually reliably grow sharper as you
[00:13:48] get older is there wear and tear sure I
[00:13:51] look at brains all the time I looked at
[00:13:54] the brain of a 93-year-old guy a couple
[00:13:56] years ago who had trauma
[00:13:59] sharp guy still worked as an accountant
[00:14:02] was still driving the reason that he
[00:14:04] even got injured was he was up on the
[00:14:05] roof of his house blowing leaves I mean
[00:14:08] 93 years old and so when I was operating
[00:14:11] on him part of me thought I'm going to
[00:14:14] see a a Nelson delis looking brain a
[00:14:16] very young healthy brain and what did I
[00:14:18] see I saw a sunken shriveled brain that
[00:14:22] was reflective of a 93y olds but the
[00:14:25] point is that it worked really really
[00:14:28] well still
[00:14:29] so the brain is this one organ that can
[00:14:31] reliably stay sharp throughout your
[00:14:33] entire life and I think some of the to
[00:14:35] your question some of the the the advice
[00:14:37] is is these relatively simple things
[00:14:39] that we don't do based on that I mean
[00:14:42] perhaps you know again going back to the
[00:14:44] definition of a healthy brain it really
[00:14:47] doesn't have to do with not that we see
[00:14:49] it all the time but the looks of the
[00:14:51] brain right like the maybe doesn't even
[00:14:53] have to do with the physical properties
[00:14:55] of the brain right right that's right
[00:14:57] which is fascinating yeah that that is I
[00:15:00] I think because we live in this sort of
[00:15:01] very tangible sort of world where we
[00:15:04] want to look at things and determine
[00:15:05] their health um uh with heart disease
[00:15:08] you want to look at a blood test and say
[00:15:10] well this ejection fraction or
[00:15:12] cholesterol level whatever is X we don't
[00:15:14] have that kind of measure of the brain
[00:15:18] um so we look at it and what we now know
[00:15:21] is that what's happening in the
[00:15:23] functioning of that brain may have
[00:15:25] little of any correlation with how it
[00:15:27] actually looks um which I you know I
[00:15:30] find this fascinating still and I've
[00:15:31] been doing this for a quarter Century I
[00:15:33] mean it's what you said at the beginning
[00:15:34] that it's still so enigmatic right yes
[00:15:37] the most enigmatic three and a half
[00:15:39] pounds of tissue in the known universe I
[00:15:41] would say and that that's saying
[00:15:42] something I mean look we're not talking
[00:15:44] about you know space travel on your on
[00:15:46] your show today but like look at human
[00:15:48] beings look at Consciousness yeah I I if
[00:15:52] you just sit back and reflect on that it
[00:15:54] is super meta you know to sort of think
[00:15:57] about that to think about your own brain
[00:15:59] I I think about it all the time and I
[00:16:01] haven't figured it out I'm going to I'm
[00:16:03] going to go a little out there U just
[00:16:05] because the last few years for me I've
[00:16:07] had some interesting experiences with my
[00:16:09] mind and um I've I've played around with
[00:16:13] a few kind of out there things that I'm
[00:16:16] starting to introduce in my channel a
[00:16:17] little bit I'm a little bit cautious
[00:16:19] because it's a bit Fringe um a bit woooo
[00:16:23] but um you know a lot of it comes down
[00:16:25] to Consciousness and and kind of this
[00:16:28] intangible thing that we're kind of
[00:16:30] dancing around but uh one of the things
[00:16:33] that's been of interest to me of late
[00:16:36] because I train my memory so intensely
[00:16:38] and I'm very aware of my performance say
[00:16:41] when I'm doing a memory task at high
[00:16:42] speed um for a top score or to try to
[00:16:45] beat my personal best you know sometimes
[00:16:48] I have this experience where I don't
[00:16:50] even feel like I'm memorizing at all
[00:16:52] like I'm just a bystander of my brain
[00:16:57] operating and the information is there
[00:17:01] to be picked at um that's not always the
[00:17:03] case where it feels so uh flow like um
[00:17:06] but you know it's similar to how maybe
[00:17:08] an athlete might consider their Flow
[00:17:09] State where they don't know what's going
[00:17:10] on they're just shooting threes and
[00:17:12] they're falling through the hoop like
[00:17:13] it's an ocean right um granted they put
[00:17:16] a lot of hours into training and then
[00:17:17] and their body's kind of on automatic at
[00:17:20] that point but they all kind of describe
[00:17:21] this this state of like not even being
[00:17:24] there it's like something T else takes
[00:17:27] over anyway so with with relation to m i
[00:17:29] find that fascinating because I often
[00:17:30] wonder is memory actually in the brain
[00:17:34] or is there something out there that we
[00:17:35] don't understand that we are interacting
[00:17:37] with that our brain is interacting with
[00:17:39] in terms of writing the data saving the
[00:17:42] data and reading the data I don't know
[00:17:44] it's a bit out there I I don't know what
[00:17:46] your take on that is I'm I'm curious
[00:17:48] well I um I think I I draw a little bit
[00:17:52] of a distinction between very functional
[00:17:54] aspects of the brain um versus things
[00:17:58] like conscious ious um I I I do think
[00:18:02] that while there's still a lot that we
[00:18:04] don't know about the brain I think we've
[00:18:06] gotten a better sense of how memory
[00:18:08] works for example and part of that is
[00:18:12] again not not just looking at healthy
[00:18:14] brains but looking at what happens when
[00:18:15] people have memory abnormalities either
[00:18:17] from disease or head injury or something
[00:18:19] like that and you you you can really get
[00:18:22] not to sound too reductionist um but you
[00:18:24] can get a real idea that this person
[00:18:26] will completely lose their short-term
[00:18:28] memory with injury to this part of their
[00:18:30] brain to their hippocampus for example
[00:18:32] so I think that that does lay down the
[00:18:34] argument at least for certain types of
[00:18:36] memory that the brain is is intricately
[00:18:40] responsible for that which is no
[00:18:42] surprise but even that those memories
[00:18:44] are stored there whereas with
[00:18:47] Consciousness you know this idea of you
[00:18:50] probably heard this term but non-local
[00:18:52] Consciousness this idea that uh that
[00:18:55] maybe Consciousness in and of itself is
[00:18:58] not stored in the brain it's stored
[00:19:00] elsewhere in a non-local way I think is
[00:19:03] is um I don't know the answer I mean
[00:19:06] that is and I don't know that I'll know
[00:19:07] the answer in my lifetime or that
[00:19:09] anybody will but but I I think there's
[00:19:12] there's there's a lot about that that we
[00:19:14] don't understand and the idea that
[00:19:15] non-local Consciousness is
[00:19:18] possible I I would not take that off the
[00:19:21] table I think that is that is quite
[00:19:23] possible and I think that raises lots of
[00:19:25] big questions Nelson sounds like some of
[00:19:27] you which you've pondered but I think it
[00:19:30] it it really really drives it this
[00:19:33] question of life and death like what
[00:19:34] happens after you die what happens to
[00:19:37] all of that
[00:19:38] Consciousness that right what's that
[00:19:42] that that Unice what happens to the
[00:19:44] thing that is you I think you know it's
[00:19:46] funny I was listening to an interview
[00:19:47] that Elon Musk did the other day and he
[00:19:49] was talking about Mars and I think one
[00:19:50] of the things that he said really stuck
[00:19:52] out to me which is that what are we
[00:19:54] really trying to preserve here um
[00:19:56] obviously we're not going to preserve
[00:19:58] all of human Life by starting to inhabit
[00:20:00] other
[00:20:01] planets but it is possible that we think
[00:20:03] of Consciousness as such a unique thing
[00:20:05] that sort of happened in in our universe
[00:20:09] in our world um that it it is worth
[00:20:12] preserving that we have to preserve
[00:20:14] Consciousness somehow that might not
[00:20:15] even take the form of a human body um
[00:20:18] might not even take the form of a human
[00:20:20] brain but Consciousness in and of itself
[00:20:22] has to be preserved and and if you start
[00:20:24] to think of it that way the idea of
[00:20:25] non-local Consciousness uh becomes again
[00:20:30] something that you keep on the table as
[00:20:32] a possibility that's fascinating to
[00:20:34] think about because you're you're 100%
[00:20:35] right or he's 100% right because
[00:20:38] nobody's you know 100 years from now I'm
[00:20:40] not going to be there you're not going
[00:20:41] to be there our kids probably won't be
[00:20:42] there obviously future humans might be
[00:20:44] there but what what what is that really
[00:20:47] like what are we trying to keep or
[00:20:49] preserve there I mean it's a history
[00:20:51] right of us the the thing that is us um
[00:20:55] yeah W I'm going to think about
[00:20:57] that I think anyone's listening I have
[00:21:00] to hit hit pause and and just consider
[00:21:02] that for a minute yeah let's let's go
[00:21:04] back down to earth for a little bit um
[00:21:07] so I always say that with memory
[00:21:09] techniques you know I'm not a a doctor
[00:21:12] I'm I'm I'm a prati practicing memory
[00:21:14] expert you know I've been in the
[00:21:16] trenches I'm doing the work and I'm
[00:21:17] seeing the results um but I'm not 80
[00:21:21] with Alzheimer's disease yet you know or
[00:21:25] or I might never be but I like to think
[00:21:28] and I get this question all the time you
[00:21:29] know will what I do or what I teach
[00:21:31] prevent Alzheimer's disease and my
[00:21:34] answer is I'm not 100% sure um I think
[00:21:37] there's a lot that goes into that
[00:21:39] question than just some memory
[00:21:41] techniques will will prevent that um I
[00:21:44] like to think that it will play A Part
[00:21:47] um and if anything it would act like a
[00:21:49] crutch um to help push back or uh uh
[00:21:54] prolong that from potentially happening
[00:21:57] what are your thoughts on on memory
[00:21:59] techniques um or or practicing your
[00:22:02] memory using your memory more frequently
[00:22:04] especially in an age where you know it's
[00:22:06] easy not to use your memory I think I
[00:22:08] think what I what I would say is that I
[00:22:10] I um do think of of uh being very
[00:22:13] intentional about memory to really uh
[00:22:15] because I I think what what it can help
[00:22:17] with is memory lapses that um people
[00:22:21] don't realize that they're they're
[00:22:23] necessarily making that they'll say that
[00:22:25] I forgot something but it's not that
[00:22:27] they forgot it's never it's that they
[00:22:29] actually never remembered it um they
[00:22:32] never went through the intentional Act
[00:22:33] of memory but I think Nelson I I might
[00:22:36] distinguish that from from something
[00:22:38] like Alzheimer's disease or even other
[00:22:39] types of dementia I think what has been
[00:22:42] so interesting is as I've you know
[00:22:44] studied this for a long time you know
[00:22:46] both both as a physician but also as an
[00:22:48] investigative journalist this idea first
[00:22:50] of all that there are places around the
[00:22:52] world where Alzheimer's dementia is very
[00:22:54] rare um now what is that why is that
[00:22:57] relevant
[00:22:59] I don't I don't think these are
[00:23:00] necessarily places where they're
[00:23:03] practicing memory techniques all the
[00:23:04] time true I think it has to do with how
[00:23:07] they're living their lives and so is
[00:23:09] there a way to live your life that can
[00:23:11] greatly reduce your risk of developing
[00:23:13] dementia and I think the answer to that
[00:23:15] is pretty clearly yes in fact um some of
[00:23:18] what we've learned recently even there
[00:23:20] have been a few big papers that have
[00:23:21] come out about this that with pretty
[00:23:24] intensive so I want to be you know I
[00:23:26] don't want to Short change it but you
[00:23:27] know intensive lifestyle changes you can
[00:23:30] dramatically reduce the chance of
[00:23:32] developing amalo plaques in your brain
[00:23:34] dramatically reduce the chance of you
[00:23:36] having clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's
[00:23:38] or or other types of dementia and what
[00:23:40] is interesting is when you look at some
[00:23:42] of those Lifestyle Changes um they're
[00:23:45] going to sound very different than what
[00:23:47] you might expect um some of them may be
[00:23:50] obvious um a plant-based diet for
[00:23:53] example we know that meat leads to lots
[00:23:57] of inflammation INF inflammation can
[00:23:59] often be the precursor for these plaques
[00:24:00] and these plaques seem to have some sort
[00:24:03] of relationship with
[00:24:04] Alzheimer's um so what you eat makes a
[00:24:08] huge difference and in places where they
[00:24:10] have very low rates of Alzheimer's they
[00:24:12] eat far less meat than we do so you know
[00:24:15] what is the right dose of plant-base
[00:24:17] versus me we we don't know but I think
[00:24:19] it's pretty clear that if you're worried
[00:24:20] about your brain um focusing on
[00:24:23] something like that makes a big
[00:24:24] difference here's another one something
[00:24:26] that you won't have a problem with
[00:24:27] because you're a very fit guy
[00:24:29] but as people get older it's they often
[00:24:31] worry about their brains but their
[00:24:33] bodies are changing as well and one of
[00:24:35] the big ways that their bodies change is
[00:24:37] the overall um um makeup of their bone
[00:24:41] their fat and their muscle you have a
[00:24:43] certain amount of bone fat and muscle on
[00:24:44] your body at any given time a certain
[00:24:46] percentage of it and a certain location
[00:24:48] for it we know for example that if you
[00:24:52] continue to have significant amount of
[00:24:53] lean muscle in your body you are less
[00:24:56] likely to develop demension
[00:24:59] so people get older they stop lifting
[00:25:02] they stop doing resistance training okay
[00:25:04] now again I I tell my parents this who
[00:25:06] were in their 80s some of that I get but
[00:25:10] the idea that somehow you just accept
[00:25:12] the fact that I can no longer have
[00:25:14] muscle on my body because I've gotten
[00:25:16] older that's not true I mean there that
[00:25:19] 93y old guy I was telling you about he
[00:25:21] was a physically fit guy you gave him a
[00:25:23] hug you felt like you were hugging a
[00:25:24] tree he's 93 years old you know so why
[00:25:28] do we think this way I think it's
[00:25:30] because you know we live a life of
[00:25:31] convenience and we stop using our
[00:25:33] muscles as much so I went through a
[00:25:35] bunch of testing and and my preventive
[00:25:38] neurologist one of the piece of advice
[00:25:40] he gave me to maintain my brain health
[00:25:43] okay so this thing I'm about to tell you
[00:25:46] was to preserve brain health and that
[00:25:48] was to wear a ruck sack now whenever I
[00:25:50] go for my my brisk walks with my dogs a
[00:25:53] ruck sack because we we get particularly
[00:25:55] bad at developing skeletal muscle we
[00:25:58] focus on our extremities legs and arms
[00:26:00] but our skeletal muscle we we it starts
[00:26:03] to wither away as we get older
[00:26:06] so can we preserve brain health yes and
[00:26:09] we can do it in ways that I think are
[00:26:11] totally surprising and I'll give you
[00:26:13] another quick one the longest nerves in
[00:26:16] our body actually are the ones that run
[00:26:17] to our feet um you're a climber so maybe
[00:26:20] this is something you think about quite
[00:26:21] a bit but most people don't think about
[00:26:23] their feet very much you wear shoes and
[00:26:25] you're not actually you're not actually
[00:26:27] stimulating the nerves in your feet very
[00:26:29] much so he recommended 10 minutes or so
[00:26:33] of wearing toe spacers every day there's
[00:26:35] little little toe spacers I don't know
[00:26:37] if you wear them as a mountain climber
[00:26:39] but but when you wear toe spacers you're
[00:26:41] actually training your toes to act
[00:26:43] independently and stimulating those
[00:26:44] nerves in your feet which could have an
[00:26:47] impact on your central nervous system
[00:26:48] and maybe reduce your chance of
[00:26:50] developing dementia W it's fascinating
[00:26:53] so so yes on the cognitive stuff yes
[00:26:56] keep stimulating your brain reading
[00:26:58] learning new skills and all that but
[00:27:00] when you activate your body in the ways
[00:27:02] that I'm describing it's almost like
[00:27:03] you're telling your brain hey man I want
[00:27:06] to be here I want you to be a partner
[00:27:09] with me for my entire life I'm not
[00:27:11] letting my body go so you meaning brain
[00:27:14] don't let the brain go either you know
[00:27:16] just keep it keep it activated so
[00:27:18] physical activity again in these ways
[00:27:20] that I'm describing may have more of an
[00:27:21] impact on brain health and just about
[00:27:23] anything else going back to the the
[00:27:25] different societies that H have rare
[00:27:28] um occurrences of of dementia and
[00:27:30] Alzheimer's where are those that you're
[00:27:33] you're referencing a lot of them
[00:27:34] correlate with these areas that Dan
[00:27:36] Butner has written about called Blue
[00:27:38] zones so for example um and i' and I
[00:27:42] visited all of them now I'm lucky to be
[00:27:44] an investigative journalist I can go
[00:27:45] spend time and immerse myself in these
[00:27:47] cultures uh okanawa for example is this
[00:27:50] one place it's an island off the coast
[00:27:52] of Japan and you know they they don't
[00:27:56] even have a word for reti re M over
[00:27:58] there there is no retirement in okanawa
[00:28:01] um older people are actually greatly
[00:28:03] revered in society they they're the ones
[00:28:05] that are sit on big boards and provide
[00:28:08] counsel for new companies that are
[00:28:10] coming coming up and and all this sort
[00:28:12] of stuff so they're they're constantly
[00:28:15] using their their brains and they're
[00:28:17] constantly active as a result of of all
[00:28:19] the things that they're still involved
[00:28:21] with um I think if you go spend time
[00:28:24] with people I I when I spend time there
[00:28:27] I spend time with the guy is 100 years
[00:28:28] old um and he he uh was teaching me
[00:28:32] karate and by the way he flipped me a
[00:28:34] couple times out of my back 100y old 100
[00:28:38] year old 100 years old and he's also
[00:28:40] this guy in the community that everyone
[00:28:41] knew he started his own business a
[00:28:43] karate studio and he's a considered this
[00:28:46] this just widely revered person when I
[00:28:49] was in Loma Linda California to bring it
[00:28:51] closer to home that's another one of
[00:28:52] these blue zones there was a guy um
[00:28:56] named warham Dr wam who was a cardiac
[00:29:00] surgeon heart surgeon performing heart
[00:29:02] surgery up until his
[00:29:04] mid90s um and came to meet me sit down
[00:29:07] in the Town Square told me he had just
[00:29:09] finished mowing his lawn and doing some
[00:29:10] yard work around the house before he
[00:29:12] came to see me where he drove himself
[00:29:14] sat down we were talking about books
[00:29:16] that we had read throughout our lives
[00:29:18] several times he remembered the titles
[00:29:19] of books that I myself could not
[00:29:21] remember at that time and I was in my
[00:29:23] 40s at the time and he was in his 90s um
[00:29:27] so you know the are these places the
[00:29:29] blue zones are a good place to look
[00:29:32] because I think the lifestyle that
[00:29:34] people have there many of these places
[00:29:35] don't have gyms um but people are just
[00:29:38] naturally active in the ways that I
[00:29:40] described they're they're walking to get
[00:29:42] from point A to point B they're walking
[00:29:44] Hills often to get that skeletal muscle
[00:29:48] sort of buil up uh from point A to point
[00:29:50] B you know their diets are much better
[00:29:53] um much of this is not going to sound
[00:29:56] surprising we eat too much processed
[00:29:57] foods that's that's a that's a brain
[00:29:59] sort of bomb those types of foods so
[00:30:02] anyway you know there are places like
[00:30:04] that around the world and I think we're
[00:30:05] going to discover more and more of them
[00:30:07] let's let's talk a little bit about um
[00:30:10] your upcoming you have a documentary
[00:30:12] coming up about Alzheimer's right can
[00:30:14] you tell me a little bit about that yeah
[00:30:16] so um this is something we've been
[00:30:18] working on for about 5 years now and
[00:30:21] what I really wanted to do was was look
[00:30:24] at where we are in terms of Alzheimer's
[00:30:27] overall I mean you know for about a
[00:30:29] decade and a half there really had been
[00:30:31] no progress on Alzheimer's in terms of
[00:30:33] new Therapeutics or anything then over
[00:30:35] the last few years you've gotten a bunch
[00:30:38] of new medications available these
[00:30:40] monoclonal antibodies lanam and things
[00:30:43] like that I really in some ways uh part
[00:30:45] of this doc wanted to tell the story of
[00:30:47] those
[00:30:49] medications their real utility uh you
[00:30:52] know if you're if you have somebody in
[00:30:53] your family or yourself considering this
[00:30:55] sort of thing but the majority of the
[00:30:57] doct doumentary really focuses on I
[00:30:59] think what we're already talking about
[00:31:01] it's this idea that we're very
[00:31:04] comfortable saying hey look we can
[00:31:06] probably predict prevent and treat heart
[00:31:10] disease are we getting to that point
[00:31:13] with the brain as well are we at that
[00:31:15] point you know where we started to get
[00:31:18] at 50 60 years ago with the with the
[00:31:19] heart and I think we are and so I
[00:31:22] followed some of these trials these
[00:31:24] these intensive lifestyle intervention
[00:31:27] trials for several years spend time with
[00:31:30] patients 5 years ago follow them again 5
[00:31:32] years later and these were all people
[00:31:34] who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's
[00:31:37] and as you may know your own
[00:31:39] grandmother's experience once you're
[00:31:41] diagnosed your your speed of trajectory
[00:31:44] may vary but typically you're not
[00:31:46] getting better you may get you may get
[00:31:49] worse more slowly but you're typically
[00:31:51] not getting
[00:31:52] better Nelson many of these people got
[00:31:55] better and it wasn't just subject L
[00:31:58] better hey I feel better they went
[00:32:00] through intensive cognitive evaluations
[00:32:03] so we knew hey look is your memory
[00:32:06] objectively better is your processing
[00:32:08] speed objectively better is your
[00:32:10] executive judgment objectively better I
[00:32:13] myself went through this cognitive
[00:32:15] testing and and I'll tell you I think
[00:32:17] for a lot of people because there's not
[00:32:18] a scan or a blood test to tell you that
[00:32:20] you have cognitive dysfunction people
[00:32:22] think this sort of testing may may have
[00:32:25] little value it's intensive
[00:32:28] um you know how many words can you can
[00:32:31] you recite right now in the next 60
[00:32:33] seconds starting with the letter G and
[00:32:35] by the way every time you pause between
[00:32:37] you lose some points if you say a simple
[00:32:39] word like go you lose points if you
[00:32:41] repeat yourself if you don't keep saying
[00:32:44] words for the whole 60 seconds you lose
[00:32:47] points it it's interesting right that's
[00:32:50] that's not an example of IQ it's an
[00:32:52] example of a very specific part of
[00:32:55] cognition if I give you 30 words
[00:32:58] and then 10 minutes later just say
[00:32:59] Nelson just recite those 30 words back
[00:33:02] to me now you're a memory Champion so
[00:33:04] you you might be able to do that I had I
[00:33:07] had I had to challenge with it and
[00:33:08] here's something that I learned is that
[00:33:10] I gravitate away from remembering words
[00:33:12] that have bees and D's in them and part
[00:33:15] of the reason I do that is because I
[00:33:17] didn't realize this but I have dyslexia
[00:33:19] and I was never told this until uh I
[00:33:22] went through this cognitive testing um
[00:33:25] your your smell there's these huge
[00:33:27] scratch sniff books of smell and you
[00:33:30] know you you you scratch it and then you
[00:33:32] sniff it and is that gasoline or is that
[00:33:33] acetone or is that a forest fire or what
[00:33:36] and imagine you know 500 smells like
[00:33:38] this that you have to do sort of rapidly
[00:33:41] these are sort of examples of of how we
[00:33:43] can evaluate cognition but the the the
[00:33:46] large point of the documentary is that
[00:33:48] whatever these tests may be however you
[00:33:51] you you look at them you can improve
[00:33:55] your scores on these things and a lot of
[00:33:58] it is through these intensive Lifestyle
[00:33:59] Changes without any new medications I
[00:34:02] met patients whose brains became uh
[00:34:04] lower in and amalo and towel levels
[00:34:07] whose cognition improved and these were
[00:34:09] people who were diagnosed with
[00:34:11] Alzheimer's so it's it's it's kind of
[00:34:14] it's it's incredible like I think half
[00:34:16] your listeners may say well obviously
[00:34:19] live a healthy life and you will reduce
[00:34:21] your chances of developing these
[00:34:23] problems sure I I don't know that
[00:34:25] everyone has thought about that being
[00:34:27] true with the brand
[00:34:28] but it is but the second part of this is
[00:34:31] that it is it's it's amazing that your
[00:34:34] brain can respond that quickly it's
[00:34:37] almost like once you start taking care
[00:34:38] of it it actually improves really really
[00:34:42] fast I don't want to suggest that
[00:34:44] anybody who has Alzheimer's out there
[00:34:46] can just start doing these things and
[00:34:48] reverse the disease but I think what
[00:34:50] this these studies show at least in the
[00:34:52] early stages of Alzheimer's right after
[00:34:54] the time someone is diagnosed you could
[00:34:56] have a significant can benefit from from
[00:35:00] lifestyle changes that I don't think
[00:35:01] people realize the significance of yeah
[00:35:05] I'd also say and this is harder to
[00:35:07] measure but I've experienced this a lot
[00:35:10] by being a coach a memory coach and
[00:35:12] teacher is that confidence in in your
[00:35:15] ability your cognition whether that's
[00:35:17] memory or any other cognitive skill goes
[00:35:20] a long way right so when you start
[00:35:22] training your memory you're probably
[00:35:23] like ah I'm just bad at this uh you know
[00:35:26] you're very familiar with forgetting
[00:35:28] things or feeling that feeling of
[00:35:30] forgetfulness but then when you start to
[00:35:32] get these little in inklings of like
[00:35:33] wait I can actually recall this or I'm
[00:35:35] sharper I start remembering more my day
[00:35:38] that almost feeds itself so I can
[00:35:41] imagine if if you're feeding your brain
[00:35:42] the right things you're starting to feel
[00:35:44] better you're starting to think sharper
[00:35:46] or get that feeling and you're doing
[00:35:47] better on these tests um that that just
[00:35:50] fuels it even more you know it's I think
[00:35:52] the brain Comes Alive like you said you
[00:35:55] know it's in a short amount amount of
[00:35:57] time I think that the thing that
[00:35:58] enhanced that or speeds that up is
[00:36:00] probably that it is this again enigmatic
[00:36:03] blob in your head that kind of has some
[00:36:07] junqua to it that I think can push it a
[00:36:10] little further I think I think you're
[00:36:11] totally right I I I and look you're
[00:36:14] you're the walking embodiment of that
[00:36:15] but that com because I know was it
[00:36:17] didn't always come easily for you so
[00:36:19] once you started to to do this and you
[00:36:21] developed that confidence it probably
[00:36:22] became self-perpetuating I mean I I got
[00:36:25] to say just because you know
[00:36:28] that room at the Swan House and you and
[00:36:32] you talking me through that gave me a
[00:36:33] lot of confidence because even though
[00:36:35] I'm I think I've been a good student my
[00:36:37] whole life and went into brain surgery I
[00:36:39] would never say that I had outstanding
[00:36:41] memory people say do you have
[00:36:42] photographic memory I'm like no I just I
[00:36:44] have to work really hard at that but the
[00:36:46] idea that even after you know those
[00:36:48] middle presidents that I would always
[00:36:50] have trouble with you know McKinley
[00:36:52] Roosevelt Taft Wilson Harding kulage
[00:36:56] Hoover
[00:36:58] that me being able to do that is Nelson
[00:37:00] Dallas that gave me a lot of confidence
[00:37:03] you know I mean it was it's it's and I
[00:37:05] still when I when I think of those
[00:37:07] presidents I still think of that room
[00:37:08] and the raft for Taft and you know the
[00:37:10] tennis ball for coolage you know so um
[00:37:13] for for hurting so you know it's it's
[00:37:15] it's it's fascinating to me when when is
[00:37:18] I'm excited to see that documentary that
[00:37:20] uh when is that and where is that May
[00:37:22] May 19th it's going to uh come out
[00:37:25] Sunday night it it'll be on CNN first
[00:37:27] and then it'll be on Max um so you can
[00:37:29] stream it on Max as well if you have Max
[00:37:32] awesome awesome and you were these are
[00:37:35] people I mean this has been in the works
[00:37:37] for years right if you're we started
[00:37:40] five years ago yeah we started filming
[00:37:42] this in in um late
[00:37:45] 2018 um to be totally canid part of the
[00:37:48] goal at that point was to get it out
[00:37:50] sooner but then you know this pandemic
[00:37:53] happened and uh and so we sort of took
[00:37:56] advantage of that time to say look we we
[00:37:59] have the opportunity now to say not just
[00:38:01] how were people doing 6 months later
[00:38:04] after these lifestyle programs but how
[00:38:05] are they doing five years later and um
[00:38:09] you know look I got parents in my 80s
[00:38:11] now and I've got Alzheimer's in my
[00:38:15] family um I think the general sort of
[00:38:18] feeling for a lot of people is despair
[00:38:21] if they if they hear that they have this
[00:38:23] in their family or they've been
[00:38:24] diagnosed themselves yeah that's not the
[00:38:28] case and and I I think um I was really
[00:38:31] inspired talking to all these
[00:38:32] researchers which is why we decided to
[00:38:34] make a documentary about it and now we
[00:38:36] can show people so they can see with
[00:38:38] their own eyes what happened to these
[00:38:41] folks over that 5year period And I think
[00:38:43] they're going to be pretty inspired by
[00:38:45] it yeah well great messages overall I
[00:38:48] mean it's always encouraging for me even
[00:38:51] still and I'm sure people watching this
[00:38:53] that there is so much you can do for
[00:38:56] your brain um you know if you think you
[00:38:58] have a terrible memory try some memory
[00:39:00] tick dinks you you'll you'll you'll see
[00:39:02] an improvement instantly yeah um you can
[00:39:05] change the way you eat you can go out
[00:39:06] for a walk wear a little backpack right
[00:39:09] um apparently that's that's get that
[00:39:11] skeletone muscle don't forget your
[00:39:12] skeletal muscle so interesting and and
[00:39:15] clearly that there's still a lot we
[00:39:16] don't know about the brain so obviously
[00:39:19] we'd like to know more about it but it's
[00:39:20] also I think um the horizons of it are
[00:39:24] exciting cuz who knows um learn in the
[00:39:27] next 50 years it's it's really exciting
[00:39:30] I mean I I think that um I think if I
[00:39:33] had to say one thing it's like get out
[00:39:34] of the way and let your brain sort of do
[00:39:37] its thing you know I mean I think we're
[00:39:39] we're constantly assaulting the brain
[00:39:40] with uh uh the crazy lifestyle things in
[00:39:43] our modern world get out of the way I
[00:39:46] mean the I mean you you're inhabiting
[00:39:49] the brain in some ways as opposed to the
[00:39:50] brain inhabiting you and and if you if
[00:39:53] you just let it do its thing it is
[00:39:56] remarkable
[00:39:57] it is absolutely remarkable great great
[00:40:00] way to end that um thank you so much
[00:40:02] Sanjay for uh being here to talk to me
[00:40:05] about brain health and I'll I'll share
[00:40:07] some links to to some of your
[00:40:09] information where they can find you they
[00:40:11] can reach out to you if they have
[00:40:12] questions your book all that uh in the
[00:40:14] description what a pleasure talking to
[00:40:17] you now you look great I I I hope you're
[00:40:19] doing as as well as you look and I hope
[00:40:21] to talk to you again soon thanks man
[00:40:23] take it easy okay you got it so there
[00:40:26] you have it Sanji Gupta everybody what'
[00:40:29] you think cool guy good friend very
[00:40:31] knowledgeable in the brain I wish I
[00:40:32] could have talk to him for longer I
[00:40:34] don't know i' when I first started this
[00:40:36] channel I did some longer form kind of
[00:40:38] interviews they're not very good let me
[00:40:39] know if you think I should do longer
[00:40:41] form interviews like that but even
[00:40:42] longer you know I had so many more
[00:40:44] questions I would have loved to ask him
[00:40:45] but I don't typically put out that kind
[00:40:47] of content so if you want to see more of
[00:40:49] that let me know anyways Sanji Gupta
[00:40:51] please check out his stuff I'll put
[00:40:52] links in the description but uh most
[00:40:55] notably his book is great keep Sharp
[00:40:57] check it out really great brain health
[00:40:59] tips in there and then check out the
[00:41:01] documentary that he mentioned which I
[00:41:02] guess at this point is now streaming on
[00:41:04] Max I watched it it's phenomenal really
[00:41:07] eye opening so please give it a watch

[00:41:20] [Music]


=== I was invited to be on a Russian game show ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe6541WrViY

[00:00:00] I was on a show in Russia called
[00:00:02] incredible people and today we're going
[00:00:04] to react to the actual airing of the
[00:00:07] episode I don't speak Russian I'm
[00:00:08] assuming you don't either so I'll do my
[00:00:10] best to explain kind of what's Happening
[00:00:12] live I have yet to see the final product
[00:00:15] I know what I did cuz I was there but
[00:00:17] hey you get the exclusive here so let's
[00:00:19] dive in you're going to see it Through
[00:00:20] The Eyes of me who was actually on the
[00:00:24] show all right so this was an airing on
[00:00:27] the main TV channel in Russia and the
[00:00:30] show is called interesting people and
[00:00:32] it's been around for I don't know like8
[00:00:35] nine 10 seasons let's pause this I've
[00:00:37] never been on the show I actually before
[00:00:39] Co was asked to be on the show this was
[00:00:43] a while ago um I couldn't make it work
[00:00:45] travel was kind of tricky Co happened
[00:00:48] Russia happened and so it's kind of been
[00:00:50] up in the air I never thought that I'd
[00:00:52] be on the show honestly after war broke
[00:00:54] out so I was kind of shocked when they
[00:00:55] asked me to be on the show I was like
[00:00:57] are you sure you want to figure out how
[00:01:00] to get an American over to Russia but
[00:01:02] anyways they made it worth my while I
[00:01:03] was excited to be on the show I've
[00:01:04] always wanted to be on the show and uh
[00:01:07] this is what it looks
[00:01:15] like I have no idea what they're saying
[00:01:17] here in general it was really
[00:01:19] interesting to travel to Russia um I've
[00:01:22] been there before years ago not since uh
[00:01:26] modern times and it was kind of
[00:01:29] nerve-racking I wasn't sure if I was
[00:01:30] going to go if it made sense for me to
[00:01:32] go if it was safe for me to go but I
[00:01:35] talked to a bunch of people and it
[00:01:37] seemed to be really a
[00:01:39] nonissue um now I know maybe some people
[00:01:42] would say like why are you even
[00:01:43] supporting Russia by going there right
[00:01:46] you're kind of saying that you're
[00:01:48] supporting it I I don't know if I saw it
[00:01:50] that way you know the people I spoke to
[00:01:52] in Russia like the producers the people
[00:01:55] on the show the people watching they are
[00:01:59] just trying to live their lives right um
[00:02:02] as am I right uh they offered a really
[00:02:05] cool challenge it was a paid gig with
[00:02:07] potential to win a lot of money so you
[00:02:11] know do I support the war no not at all
[00:02:15] it's not about the politics so for those
[00:02:17] of you that are upset that I went you
[00:02:20] know I'm sorry anyway so I got there uh
[00:02:22] really got my Visa last minute flew over
[00:02:25] there had to fly through Dubai super jet
[00:02:29] lagged pretty pretty much the next day I
[00:02:31] had to film this thing uh barely did a
[00:02:33] dress rehearsal I went after an act that
[00:02:35] was a really cool physical act of a guy
[00:02:38] who kept doing back flips in the green
[00:02:39] room he was insane he would just be
[00:02:41] standing there doing handstand push-ups
[00:02:43] freestanding handstand push-ups while
[00:02:45] I'm there freaking memorizing things
[00:02:46] like a nerd and uh then he went
[00:02:49] on before me he was doing back flips
[00:02:51] jumping through tiny spaces it was
[00:02:52] insane so of course I'm going up against
[00:02:55] that like you have something really
[00:02:56] physical and exciting and then me which
[00:02:58] is like really
[00:03:00] arguably boring just staring at
[00:03:03] numbers um but anyways he's a super cool
[00:03:05] guy uh I think he performed on Circ to
[00:03:08] back in the day anyways okay so the next
[00:03:11] day I was exhausted right they made us
[00:03:14] hang out the whole day in the green room
[00:03:16] until it was our time let me pause this
[00:03:18] cuz this is embarrassing until it was my
[00:03:20] time to be on stage and then when it was
[00:03:21] done I had to go back to the green room
[00:03:23] until the whole show was done
[00:03:25] and I was just exhausted my eyes were
[00:03:28] like bloodshot and anyways the next
[00:03:30] morning I didn't sleep we got back to
[00:03:31] the hotel at like 3:00 in the morning
[00:03:33] and I had been there since 8:00 a.m. the
[00:03:34] previous day and then I had to film kind
[00:03:37] of like a a profile piece which was
[00:03:39] really just like a hype piece it was so
[00:03:42] I don't even know what the this is
[00:03:44] but we went to some studio they wanted
[00:03:46] to get like the Mountaineer Vibe so they
[00:03:48] had like a chalet set you can see I am
[00:03:51] tired here but anyways yeah basically
[00:03:54] did a little interview they talk about
[00:03:55] my background Who I Am What do I do and
[00:03:58] how I got into it my whole story which
[00:04:00] you guys know but yeah I mean I'm in
[00:04:03] this fake set of a mountain house and
[00:04:05] there's like fur coats on the bed I
[00:04:08] randomly just am you know memorizing
[00:04:11] cards good God I look tired there and
[00:04:15] um yeah they had some magazine which
[00:04:18] happened to have like something about
[00:04:20] rock climbing in it so they had me turn
[00:04:22] to those pages and just like fondle them
[00:04:24] and caress them as if I was like reading
[00:04:26] something
[00:04:28] interesting yeah so I don't know what
[00:04:31] that was about but I guess they had to
[00:04:32] have something to show me before I
[00:04:34] actually went on anyways we can fast
[00:04:35] forward this let's see I know I tripped
[00:04:38] when I walked on the stage hopefully
[00:04:40] they didn't catch that let's
[00:04:42] see there was nothing in that coffee mug
[00:04:44] by the
[00:04:45] way right here we go oh yes they cut out
[00:04:49] the trip thank goodness that was so
[00:04:51] embarrassing you know I'm like don't
[00:04:52] trip don't trip and then they call me
[00:04:53] out and of course I trip all
[00:04:55] right so there's four judges who don't
[00:04:58] really have a say other than to
[00:05:00] commentate on what they thought the
[00:05:02] audience is the one that actually judges
[00:05:04] here so I was second to go out um I meet
[00:05:08] with this host he tells me what I'm
[00:05:10] about to do and I am supposed to
[00:05:13] basically look at a Russian map there
[00:05:15] are 85 or so different states in Russia
[00:05:18] just like in the US we have 50 states
[00:05:20] they have 85 Plus let's say and each
[00:05:23] state if you look at a license plate of
[00:05:25] a car from that state there is a two or
[00:05:28] three-digit number code on that license
[00:05:30] plate each one pertains to one of these
[00:05:32] regions some regions even have multiple
[00:05:35] numbers associated with them depending
[00:05:36] on population like Moscow has had like
[00:05:39] 12 different ones or something so
[00:05:41] anyways I have to memorize all of those
[00:05:43] codes those number codes numeric codes
[00:05:45] and be able to pinpoint where they
[00:05:47] belong on a map so they have little
[00:05:49] Bunches of flags with the numbers on
[00:05:51] them and I have to go to an actual board
[00:05:54] and pin them in the right location I had
[00:05:56] 10 minutes to memorize all of them here
[00:05:58] they are and and they had them on three
[00:06:00] separate screens they gave me about 10
[00:06:02] minutes uh which honestly was a bit too
[00:06:05] much I think but whatever I wanted to
[00:06:07] get it perfect they want me to be
[00:06:09] successful they want everybody to be
[00:06:10] successful I like that about the show so
[00:06:13] here I am uh you know the audience was
[00:06:16] awesome they were quiet they let me
[00:06:18] stare at these boards for 10 minutes
[00:06:20] straight and you could look look some of
[00:06:22] the names of these if you're not from
[00:06:24] Russia and you look at these words they
[00:06:25] look insane but I noticed very quickly
[00:06:27] that um a lot of these ended with
[00:06:30] or oblast ski or skaya so I didn't
[00:06:34] really look at that stuff to memorize an
[00:06:37] image for these regions I really just
[00:06:40] took like a word or two or a syllable or
[00:06:42] two from the front of that word that
[00:06:45] place and created an image right like
[00:06:48] merman there thought of like a merman a
[00:06:51] Mermaid Man merman merad Saratov skaya
[00:06:56] so Sarah thought of my sister her middle
[00:06:58] name is Sarah K Sky kirg I thought of
[00:07:01] like a corg keyboard mosco obviously I
[00:07:04] think of Moscow that wasn't too hard
[00:07:06] permsky cray I thought of somebody with
[00:07:08] a perm bik onur thought of a bike I
[00:07:11] don't know Russian so I had to really be
[00:07:13] quick about this too and then in terms
[00:07:15] of the number again it was either a two
[00:07:17] or three-digit number I have an image
[00:07:19] for all two three-digit numbers so that
[00:07:21] was perfect I just Associated that
[00:07:23] person with this thing like om skaya is
[00:07:25] 55 so 55 is Elton John om Sky I just
[00:07:29] thought thought of somebody like in the
[00:07:30] sky kind of meditating saying oh all
[00:07:33] right and it was Elton John that's my
[00:07:35] image so when I see 55 I know oh sky and
[00:07:39] I can put that on the map so I went
[00:07:40] through all of them once they don't
[00:07:42] really show me much here they of course
[00:07:44] cut this racing back and forth but I
[00:07:46] actually went through it once quite
[00:07:48] quickly maybe in like five minutes and
[00:07:50] then I rushed back to kind of make sure
[00:07:52] that I had everything here one thing
[00:07:55] they didn't explain this but what I do I
[00:07:58] always look for patterns
[00:08:00] uh to make my life easier when I'm
[00:08:01] memorizing and I thought to myself well
[00:08:04] are there any patterns to these numbers
[00:08:06] and it turns out that yes some that were
[00:08:09] that had multiple it was really only
[00:08:12] numbers that were let's say a certain
[00:08:14] region had 50 5 then if it had multiple
[00:08:18] it also had 150 250 750 and sometimes
[00:08:23] 950 for whatever reason it was always
[00:08:25] with a leading one a two a seven or a
[00:08:28] nine and so I could take advantage of
[00:08:30] that because a lot of them you know I
[00:08:31] just remember that oh this one was the
[00:08:33] 55 but it also had 155 or this one was
[00:08:38] 777 but it also had 977 and 277 things
[00:08:42] like that so that made it a little bit
[00:08:45] easier but I don't really know the
[00:08:47] Russian map very well I know where
[00:08:49] Moscow is I know where St Petersburg is
[00:08:52] yeah that's it luckily the one thing
[00:08:54] that they did help me with is beforehand
[00:08:57] they let me look at a map of Russia I
[00:08:59] mean I could look it up on my phone too
[00:09:01] not that I had them all down pat but I
[00:09:03] was more familiar with it going into it
[00:09:06] than I was let's say before flying out
[00:09:08] to Russia so it was leaning more on
[00:09:11] memorizing the numbers rather than
[00:09:12] memorizing numbers and in the moment
[00:09:14] having to memorize a freaking Russian
[00:09:16] map so here they bring out the massive
[00:09:20] map that they built just for me thought
[00:09:22] this was so cool and here are all of the
[00:09:24] numbers a lot wow so uh time starts and
[00:09:28] I didn't really have a uh I well did
[00:09:30] they they may have given me a clock a
[00:09:32] 10-minute clock but I think they just
[00:09:34] wanted me to finish so I'm trying to
[00:09:36] grab groups here um that go together
[00:09:39] like this area had 790 750 let's see let
[00:09:42] me pause it here right so you can see
[00:09:44] there's 90 right but then there's also
[00:09:47] 190 150 790 750 right so they all either
[00:09:51] end in 50 or 90 so if I can memorize 50
[00:09:54] 90 50 is the rapper 50 Cent 90 is famous
[00:09:58] Bas player so knowing the pattern the
[00:10:00] 190 the 790 helped a lot here so this
[00:10:05] took a while but it was uh definitely
[00:10:08] doable at first I was a bit stressed cuz
[00:10:10] you know you see there's a lot of things
[00:10:12] on the board um I just want to get them
[00:10:14] out uh and the more I put on the board
[00:10:17] the easier and faster it becomes now the
[00:10:19] front two here you see I'm just putting
[00:10:21] some on the table they had specific
[00:10:23] tables for Moscow specifically and St
[00:10:25] Petersburg since those had the most uh
[00:10:28] codes so instead of me trying to like
[00:10:31] pin them on the board in this tiny
[00:10:32] little space they said for those two
[00:10:33] just put it on the table so I tried to
[00:10:35] get those out of the way first cuz there
[00:10:37] were like 12 for Moscow and like eight
[00:10:40] for St Petersburg and so now you know
[00:10:42] I'm going back and forth uh placing some
[00:10:44] of these some of them broke on me like
[00:10:47] the way that they pinned uh they didn't
[00:10:49] really do a good job kind of preparing
[00:10:52] the the items so that was weird cuz I
[00:10:55] kind of had to like put them on the
[00:10:56] floor I don't know if they show that
[00:10:58] here but I don't see it yet I was
[00:11:00] curious if they were going to cut this
[00:11:02] but uh looks like they're really showing
[00:11:04] most of this kind of boring for live
[00:11:07] television I think maybe people find
[00:11:08] this interesting but no I guess as I
[00:11:10] start to fill it out I I think it kind
[00:11:12] of looks kind of impressive like hon was
[00:11:15] 84 and 184 I thought of a person and 84
[00:11:19] is Larry David 184 is his buddy Jeff so
[00:11:23] I just imagine both of them hanging out
[00:11:26] as being person person now at one point
[00:11:29] Point yeah I'm I'm struggling here so I
[00:11:32] had two pieces in my hand all right one
[00:11:36] um I believe I was holding because I
[00:11:38] couldn't stick it on I think it broke
[00:11:40] the
[00:11:41] other was that I swear that they gave me
[00:11:45] a number that did not exist on the map I
[00:11:47] I thought they were with me and
[00:11:49] I felt so embarrassed because it's like
[00:11:50] why would they do this on a show it's
[00:11:52] kind of tricky and then I freaked out I
[00:11:54] kind of like didn't know what to do cuz
[00:11:56] I was like I think I made a mistake but
[00:11:58] then at the same time I was like no I I
[00:12:00] know I know this and and this is not on
[00:12:02] the map eventually I told the guy I
[00:12:06] think this is
[00:12:07] wrong and it was kind of awkward um you
[00:12:10] know had the audience clap for me but
[00:12:12] it's
[00:12:13] like I didn't want them to think that I
[00:12:16] did an incomplete task here
[00:12:26] [Applause]
[00:12:29] okay okay so I think here yeah they cut
[00:12:30] it a little bit um I think he was
[00:12:33] confirming backstage that they did
[00:12:35] actually try to trick me by adding or
[00:12:37] planting a couple extra codes or flags
[00:12:40] that weren't actually corresponding to
[00:12:43] anything on the map so you could see me
[00:12:46] being like okay F and I think some of
[00:12:48] the judges were actually really
[00:12:49] impressed by this and then I mean I
[00:12:51] guess this was to kind of appease the
[00:12:53] audience and the viewers they had the
[00:12:55] judges come up and uh check some at
[00:12:57] random I think some of these people were
[00:13:00] from these regions so they were just
[00:13:02] going to chime in and be like that's
[00:13:04] right and they pull it up on the board
[00:13:05] and it matched correct Nelson got it
[00:13:07] right in reality I guess nobody checked
[00:13:10] that all of them were correct they were
[00:13:13] though you know what were they going to
[00:13:14] do on live TV that would have taken
[00:13:15] forever so they just at random took some
[00:13:18] and and checked like this Moscow one was
[00:13:21] 797 all good now they seemed impressed
[00:13:24] the judges I don't know if they were
[00:13:26] acting or thinking like hey yeah that's
[00:13:29] oh this is so amazing but maybe it
[00:13:31] really wasn't I don't think it was that
[00:13:33] hard I thought it was a cool challenge
[00:13:35] but I I was always kind of curious what
[00:13:38] the impression of it was from a viewer's
[00:13:40] point of view what do you think is this
[00:13:42] interesting cool I don't know anyways
[00:13:45] that was cool bunch of other people came
[00:13:48] up some uh blind guy did something
[00:13:50] really impressive there was a little kid
[00:13:52] doing mental calculations another memory
[00:13:55] guy memorizing uh restaurant orders some
[00:13:58] bike guy jumping from crate to Crate and
[00:14:01] then at the end of the day we all got
[00:14:03] called up on stage to announce the
[00:14:05] winners the winner there were eight
[00:14:07] people would go on to a final episode
[00:14:09] the next week to potentially win like
[00:14:12] $60,000 I wanted to win the money but at
[00:14:15] the same time I wanted to go home I
[00:14:17] didn't want to be in Russia for any
[00:14:18] longer honestly so I'm kind of glad that
[00:14:21] I didn't win a spoiler but anyways they
[00:14:23] had us all up on stage and then they
[00:14:25] basically give the audience these things
[00:14:27] to press the button there I am hello
[00:14:29] to vote and then they go through each
[00:14:32] person what percentage of the vote they
[00:14:33] had oh all the judges kind of gave their
[00:14:36] two cents and honestly it's funny
[00:14:37] because a lot of them said that they
[00:14:39] liked my performance and they thought it
[00:14:41] was amazing so kind of felt really good
[00:14:43] even though ultimately it wasn't up to
[00:14:45] them so anyways they vote blah blah blah
[00:14:48] the votes are
[00:14:50] [Applause]
[00:14:53] in first
[00:14:57] dude 24 4% quarter of the
[00:15:07] votes
[00:15:08] 19% so in that moment I was like damn
[00:15:12] but also cool I get to go home now in
[00:15:15] the end I actually got the second most
[00:15:17] votes which is cool you know second
[00:15:19] place the guy who won was the acrobat
[00:15:22] guy who got 25 24% now what kind of blew
[00:15:26] my mind was after he won all the judges
[00:15:30] kind of said a final word and then they
[00:15:32] all mentioned how they loved the the
[00:15:35] couple that did the balancing stuff from
[00:15:36] China and they said you know what we're
[00:15:38] going to allow that amazing performance
[00:15:40] to go to the finals as well so I was
[00:15:43] like wait what shouldn't you take the
[00:15:45] second place person shouldn't that make
[00:15:47] the most sense right I got the second
[00:15:48] most amount of votes they got like four
[00:15:51] or fifth place votes so I was I was kind
[00:15:53] of out of my mind I don't know if they
[00:15:55] had worked out some deal under the table
[00:15:57] or something like that but in the end I
[00:16:00] was honestly happy to go home and uh it
[00:16:02] was a really cool experience a to go to
[00:16:04] Russia to Moscow I'd never been to
[00:16:06] Moscow beautiful city got to see the
[00:16:08] cathedral got to walk around town um it
[00:16:11] felt amazing to be there and felt safe
[00:16:14] yeah I was really surprised to hear from
[00:16:15] the people there you know they're just
[00:16:16] trying to live their lives they got jobs
[00:16:18] to do they got lives to live and you
[00:16:20] know they don't necessarily agree with
[00:16:22] the politics I feel like that's kind of
[00:16:24] why they wanted an American out there
[00:16:26] after the fact and this is kind of crazy
[00:16:29] um I realize that you know I'm looking
[00:16:31] at this map of Russia and I'm looking at
[00:16:33] these Russian words and I don't really
[00:16:35] think much about anything beyond the
[00:16:37] pneumonics that I have and of course I
[00:16:39] realized after that I at one point put a
[00:16:42] flag for one of the license plate
[00:16:44] numbers on what is Crimea except it was
[00:16:47] a Russian word for that someone said to
[00:16:49] me like of course they got the American
[00:16:51] guy to come on a Russian show and to
[00:16:54] kind of acknowledge without saying so uh
[00:16:57] Crimea right being a part of Russia I
[00:16:59] was like yeah of course they would do
[00:17:01] that I don't know I don't think that was
[00:17:02] intentional but it is kind of ironic
[00:17:04] that they got me to do that um and I
[00:17:06] didn't even think about it so whatever
[00:17:09] is there a bit of propaganda in there
[00:17:11] maybe um but you know I was just there
[00:17:15] because you know I want the experience
[00:17:19] uh I love to travel and um you know it's
[00:17:24] it's a gig in the end of it all and it's
[00:17:26] a Memory challenge which I'm always down
[00:17:28] for m challenge I want to win some money
[00:17:31] let's go anyways that's the exclusive if
[00:17:33] you know any Russian or know anybody
[00:17:34] speaking Russian I'll put the link to
[00:17:36] that full episode below and you can
[00:17:38] watch it in all its glory and uh maybe
[00:17:41] you can even tell me what they actually
[00:17:43] said but anyways that's it for now uh
[00:17:46] back to our regular programming uh in
[00:17:48] future videos I'll see you I'm out Spa I
[00:17:52] don't I literally know zero Russian
[00:17:55] anyways bye
[00:17:59] thank you so
[00:18:01] much thank you so much
[00:18:05] [Music]


=== can I solve this puzzle without looking at it?? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3Mh3S8L5qQ

[00:00:00] I did a recent video with Chris Ramsay
[00:00:02] where I was solving one of these
[00:00:05] self-discovery boxes puzzle boxes
[00:00:07] whatever I'm not a puzzle guy at all uh
[00:00:10] even in that video I said I have a a lot
[00:00:13] of anxiety with solving puzzles so
[00:00:15] keybox who made the puzzle that you may
[00:00:17] have seen in the video with Chris I said
[00:00:19] you know what it would be cool if I try
[00:00:21] to solve a puzzle like
[00:00:24] that
[00:00:26] blindfolded the point being is that I
[00:00:29] would have to use my memory more to feel
[00:00:31] around and figure out this puzzle I
[00:00:34] asked them hey do you have a puzzle
[00:00:35] that's maybe easier that I could
[00:00:37] potentially do that with cuz obviously
[00:00:39] the one I did with Chris impossible
[00:00:41] because you actually had to read some
[00:00:43] things that weren't very tactile so it
[00:00:45] would have been impossible blindfold
[00:00:46] with but I asked them are there some
[00:00:49] that you could do blindfolded they said
[00:00:50] you're crazy never been done before but
[00:00:53] here you go you could try it with this
[00:00:54] one so they sent me one of their boxes
[00:00:56] it's supposedly a 10minute easy peasy
[00:01:00] puzzle so let's see how that goes now I
[00:01:03] got my overhead video here yeah I'm kind
[00:01:05] of nervous uh but let's read the back
[00:01:07] here just so we have all the information
[00:01:09] we need this is a sequential Discovery
[00:01:11] puzzle box it requires a series of steps
[00:01:13] and the use of tools you will find along
[00:01:16] the way the puzzle is solved when you
[00:01:17] find the hidden token depending on your
[00:01:19] experience the solve will take you
[00:01:20] anywhere between 10 to 45 minutes cool
[00:01:25] all right so I do remember Chris telling
[00:01:27] me with a previous one to not force
[00:01:30] anything right These are 3D printed so
[00:01:32] they can potentially break I guess if
[00:01:34] you try too hard but they should if it's
[00:01:36] supposed to move uh should move without
[00:01:39] much force all right without further Ado
[00:01:41] I'm stalling here clearly uh let's get
[00:01:44] on my blindfolded I'm going to open this
[00:01:47] throw away the box and we are going to
[00:01:49] go to town
[00:01:51] right
[00:01:52] now all right I can't see uh I've worned
[00:01:56] this in other videos before and people
[00:01:57] are like oh you can always see beneath
[00:01:59] there but I can't I can't see
[00:02:01] anything because these are tight pushed
[00:02:03] against my eyeballs here there's a bit
[00:02:05] of a gap in my nose here but it's sealed
[00:02:07] here I can't see okay I cannot see
[00:02:10]  all right um all right so here's
[00:02:13] the
[00:02:18] Box this is just packaging I
[00:02:21] presume I don't think that's part of it
[00:02:23] there is probably some kind of message
[00:02:25] here but I cannot read it so let's just
[00:02:28] toss that away here is the
[00:02:31] Box nothing in that
[00:02:36] box oh interesting okay there's
[00:02:38] something already pretty Wiggly here all
[00:02:41] right so my first idea
[00:02:45] is I really don't have any ideas okay I
[00:02:47] can feel a bunch of knobs here and I
[00:02:50] need to kind of get some
[00:02:54] visual memory of this box okay so I
[00:02:57] don't know what's up or down I can't
[00:02:59] really tell but I'm going to say that
[00:03:00] this flat side here is the bottom all
[00:03:04] right so in front of
[00:03:06] me I
[00:03:08] have what seems like a somewhat
[00:03:11] pressable
[00:03:12] button okay thicker
[00:03:15] here uh one on the left here that isn't
[00:03:18] pressable at all so this one is
[00:03:21] pressable this one is not on
[00:03:24] top a even bigger one and the back
[00:03:32] this one does press in a bit the back
[00:03:34] here I guess these are all pretty
[00:03:36] similar uh how I'm trying to think of
[00:03:40] how high or low they are if they're all
[00:03:42] in the
[00:03:46] same no I think they're this one's the
[00:03:48] lowest and this goes higher okay and
[00:03:51] then here we
[00:03:53] have this kind
[00:03:57] of this moves a little bit so I would
[00:04:00] imagine that there's something that
[00:04:01] needs to shift or come out
[00:04:06] okay now that we have the lay of the
[00:04:08] land um I got to start playing with
[00:04:10] all right so let's see if I press
[00:04:19] this this seems to like slide a little
[00:04:23] bit this is hard uh okay do they
[00:04:26] pull out
[00:04:31] this one does not budge at all does it
[00:04:33] rotate no does
[00:04:36] this oh okay all right we got somewhere
[00:04:39] here this so this is my back hang I want
[00:04:43] to make sure that none of these can I
[00:04:45] don't want to lose my place so clearly
[00:04:47] the big knob is on top flat is on the
[00:04:49] bottom so this twisty
[00:04:54] one comes out I want to be careful that
[00:04:57] I
[00:04:58] don't lose anything
[00:05:00] thing okay um okay what did that
[00:05:05] do this is just a screw
[00:05:13] end okay maybe this pushes better now
[00:05:17] let's
[00:05:24] see I don't think that that helped with
[00:05:27] anything well that's not true maybe
[00:05:34] this don't want to lose that does
[00:05:37] anything else screw off
[00:05:40] here does it pull out
[00:05:47] no is it a magnet of
[00:05:53] sorts I've seen in Chris's video
[00:05:56] sometimes these things do magnet
[00:06:00] type
[00:06:16] things I don't like the shakiness of
[00:06:19] some things that I am feeling back there
[00:06:30] let me see what happens if I put this
[00:06:38] [Music]
[00:06:42] back all right let me unscrew that again
[00:06:45] clearly that's the first move because
[00:06:47] that is the most obvious thing I've seen
[00:06:50] well
[00:06:55] felt uh let's see
[00:07:02] I'm missing anything that slides
[00:07:07] here totally
[00:07:10] smooth wait this is not oh wait a minute
[00:07:13] what is this what is
[00:07:17] this there's a hole here is this the
[00:07:20] only side with a hole let me feel
[00:07:24] this nothing on the front
[00:07:27] here nothing on the
[00:07:30] side but there is a freaking
[00:07:42] hole okay
[00:07:44] so what the do I do with this
[00:07:48] hole that's what she said
[00:08:00] all right what
[00:08:01] if somehow you
[00:08:05] press so I'm pressing on this other side
[00:08:10] here this does not seem to be moving
[00:08:13] much what if that comes out to the
[00:08:26] side these do not turn at all
[00:08:44] all right so
[00:08:47] wait I'll have it upside down
[00:08:53] okay feel if there's any Edge
[00:08:56] like components to this I am I am so
[00:09:00] dumb I feel so dumb right now but again
[00:09:03] who else is stupid enough to try this
[00:09:06] blindfolded all right let me I feel like
[00:09:09] the magnet thing is a thing all right
[00:09:12] this hole what the do I do with
[00:09:14] this
[00:09:20] hole there's stuff in there okay 10
[00:09:23] minutes my
[00:09:25] ass so this can I tighten this
[00:09:35] that doesn't turn anymore because I was
[00:09:36] thinking maybe you can take this out and
[00:09:38] use this for the hole still feel
[00:09:49] like there's some
[00:09:52] magnet thing
[00:09:56] here all right let's
[00:10:00] delicately play with this sliding this
[00:10:04] clearly
[00:10:09] slides is there some kind
[00:10:19] of almost
[00:10:33] sequential Discovery okay so each piece
[00:10:37] kind of goes to the next
[00:10:49] right go this is going to be the most
[00:10:51] boring video if I don't figure something
[00:10:53] out
[00:10:56] soon does have a little bit of give
[00:10:59] there let's
[00:11:08] see oh wait okay if I push this down
[00:11:13] this just came out a little bit more
[00:11:15] than it did before what was that what
[00:11:18] was that how did I do
[00:11:25] that what do I do with this
[00:11:33] all right come on give me
[00:11:42] something all right we're making some
[00:11:44] progress here why did this come out
[00:11:49] suddenly okay push it back
[00:11:55] in why you teasing me like that bro come
[00:11:58] on what are we doing doing
[00:12:02] here okay so that doesn't move but then
[00:12:05] I press this ah it comes out a little
[00:12:08] bit how do I get it what does that
[00:12:13] do is it gravity based or something
[00:12:50] on to something I know that oh there's a
[00:12:52] little Gap
[00:12:55] here huh okay
[00:13:00] [Music]
[00:13:06] if I use a bit of pressure
[00:13:20] here all right so this came out wonder
[00:13:23] if
[00:13:25] I unscrew this now does that
[00:13:31] oh oh interesting okay cool look at this
[00:13:34] something has come out so I pushed the
[00:13:38] other button pull this other one out a
[00:13:40] little bit and then this I guess is some
[00:13:43] kind of key here there's a
[00:13:46] hole got to be careful where I put this
[00:13:48] I don't want to lose that let me try to
[00:13:51] orient myself so again the top yes this
[00:13:54] is my
[00:13:55] front this one that came out oh shoot
[00:13:59] okay yeah yeah yeah all right so I had
[00:14:00] to push this down pull this slightly out
[00:14:03] and then that thing came out I guess I
[00:14:06] didn't really have to unscrew the cap
[00:14:07] but maybe that's for another piece maybe
[00:14:11] let me put those back together just so
[00:14:15] that I don't lose
[00:14:19] that
[00:14:21] okay interesting oh this groove here
[00:14:24] probably was what was
[00:14:26] inside of the hole
[00:14:30] I had a hole here does that have to do
[00:14:32] with
[00:14:35] anything that doesn't look like that
[00:14:37] does anything okay all right so now
[00:14:40] great I did something
[00:14:41] okay um does that make this oh this
[00:14:44] feels like it now has come looser a
[00:14:48] little
[00:14:50] bit let me play around with
[00:14:55] this has such give here that's so crazy
[00:15:03] a little more
[00:15:05] delicate that come off it's got to come
[00:15:12] off right clearly goes up are there any
[00:15:14] gaps
[00:15:16] here and then can I go to the left
[00:15:19] or rotate
[00:15:23] more let me see here
[00:15:31] it goes up so easily
[00:15:35] there oh that was different is there
[00:15:39] some kind of like track in
[00:15:41] there
[00:15:43] oh
[00:15:45] wait hang on I'm close to something here
[00:15:47] what's Happening Here What's Happening
[00:15:49] Here what did I
[00:15:53] [Music]
[00:15:56] do okay this is definitely coming off
[00:16:01] somehow let me wiggle
[00:16:03] this does that need to be pushed in does
[00:16:05] that do anything all right come on come
[00:16:08] on come on come on don't this up
[00:16:10] Nelson so I pull this here does this go
[00:16:15] anywhere oh wait what what is this what
[00:16:19] is this
[00:16:24] now oh
[00:16:26] wait come on come on baby yes no keeps
[00:16:32] feeling like I've hit some Mark that's
[00:16:52] like all
[00:16:54] right that feels right
[00:17:03] Oh weird it's rotating so weird
[00:17:17] like wait what is
[00:17:20] this oh there's some like yeah there's a
[00:17:23] track here for
[00:17:25] sure okay that goes up
[00:17:29] and
[00:17:36] then all right this has got to be a key
[00:17:39] here I'm
[00:17:47] [Music]
[00:17:54] close did I just lose my progress what
[00:17:57] was the was going on here
[00:18:02] here all right up to the side down oh
[00:18:06] what did I do here oh well that was
[00:18:09] smooth what the heck happen okay there's
[00:18:11] Nubs
[00:18:14] here what is
[00:18:16] this oh maybe that's the track that it
[00:18:18] was on or something okay all right cool
[00:18:21] all right so I did something else well
[00:18:24] don't lose that
[00:18:25] piece Okay
[00:18:27] so two Nubs here maybe this these Nubs
[00:18:32] do something later I don't know okay so
[00:18:35] I took this fraking thing
[00:18:37] off um now what okay so now this whole
[00:18:41] face has a lot of stuff that I can
[00:18:45] feel what is this circle
[00:18:48] thing oh is that
[00:18:50] maybe where is my don't knock anything
[00:18:54] over does this maybe play apart here
[00:19:04] I mean
[00:19:06] screws
[00:19:08] Forever Wait what is this oh shoot oh I
[00:19:11] see it threaded something for me to P oh
[00:19:14] cool okay so this is maybe a tool yeah
[00:19:17] yeah it said in the instructions that
[00:19:19] there's some tools involved so this is
[00:19:21] some kind of tool nice okay I'm getting
[00:19:25] somewhere wow I'm pretty impressed with
[00:19:27] myself okay so I have the cover I have
[00:19:32] this stick that came
[00:19:34] out I got this out oh there's a big hole
[00:19:37] there
[00:19:39] now let me put this up so it doesn't
[00:19:41] roll
[00:19:42] away uh let's see so oh this thing gives
[00:19:47] more now before it did not budge at
[00:19:50] all so that's good to know this still
[00:19:54] pushes the
[00:19:55] same um again this is the
[00:19:59] track I believe that that face was on
[00:20:02] but then there's something down here
[00:20:04] some
[00:20:05] slot does that
[00:20:09] fit I don't think so oh but that hole
[00:20:12] here I wonder does this fit in that
[00:20:18] hole yes no
[00:20:22] maybe hang on can I put this on right
[00:20:34] oh man if I drop this speedrun is
[00:20:38] over maybe I don't need that
[00:20:42] um that's the bottom here's the
[00:20:56] hole all right what
[00:20:59] next okay that tucks in there
[00:21:13] nicely all right what is this hole for
[00:21:16] Buddy does that go back in there somehow
[00:21:35] something got to do with this
[00:21:46] guy we haven't done anything with this
[00:21:48] big knob does it turn it's clearly
[00:21:50] looser now you hear
[00:21:52] that
[00:21:56] right does it come out maybe at some
[00:21:59] point it comes out all right so the
[00:22:03] biggest change that's happened here is
[00:22:04] that this is now moving so and I there's
[00:22:09] something in there
[00:22:12] so let me does that have to do with the
[00:22:16] orientation that give me a little more
[00:22:19] give I don't
[00:22:22] know oh interest oh it's coming out it's
[00:22:26] uh clearly having to do with some kind
[00:22:29] of
[00:22:31] pin that is maybe gravitational or
[00:22:34] something okay what did I just do uh now
[00:22:38] let me get my orientation again so this
[00:22:41] the thing that I moved was on
[00:22:43] top flat side on the
[00:22:47] bottom the piece that I took out was in
[00:22:50] the
[00:22:51] back yeah okay so this is how my
[00:22:53] original orientation was all right so I
[00:22:56] took this out now what the now I
[00:22:59] remember there's a slot thing here I
[00:23:01] wonder if that's of
[00:23:04] importance
[00:23:07] um what is
[00:23:10] this I mean there's notches here but
[00:23:13] that probably kept it in place here what
[00:23:15] if the tool that I have what if that
[00:23:18] button
[00:23:20] here where's that
[00:23:23] hole
[00:23:26] wh uh-oh what did I do
[00:23:33] here what's
[00:23:39] this what is
[00:23:41] this is there something in here there's
[00:23:43] something in here I think this is it I
[00:23:45] think this oh I think this is the the
[00:23:48] the the the piece it's got a k on it or
[00:23:50] something right did I do it did I do it
[00:23:53] I did it I did
[00:23:55] it I did
[00:23:57] it wow wow that is that is awesome that
[00:24:01] is pretty cool
[00:24:06] um how cool was that so yeah now that I
[00:24:10] look at it not so difficult but yeah not
[00:24:14] easy when you're blindfolded so okay so
[00:24:16] this was in
[00:24:19] there
[00:24:22] right like
[00:24:25] that and this piece pushed that oh cuz
[00:24:28] it's it's curved so it like pushed that
[00:24:32] out that's clever God these guys are so
[00:24:35] clever with their design so that was
[00:24:36] there this was on the
[00:24:39] top I think they disappear when
[00:24:42] this is
[00:24:43] up or
[00:24:46] something I don't know anyways clearly
[00:24:49] to do with some kind of uh gravity some
[00:24:52] kind of gravity here um but yeah and
[00:24:55] then
[00:24:56] this was in there had this
[00:25:03] reverse reverse threading right yes cuz
[00:25:07] I did that oh how
[00:25:10] cool how cool and then that was at the
[00:25:12] end of
[00:25:15] this which went in
[00:25:20] here which went through this yeah which
[00:25:23] also that's why this was so firmly in
[00:25:25] place because it had this going right
[00:25:27] through it
[00:25:29] right like that something like
[00:25:30] that I think yeah and then
[00:25:35] this yeah there's some kind of like maze
[00:25:37] track do you see that that's why this
[00:25:39] thing was so difficult to get
[00:25:41] off you had to like slide it then up
[00:25:43] then
[00:25:44] over I can't tell you what I did uh but
[00:25:48] I just jiggled it around and it
[00:25:50] eventually
[00:25:51] worked cool
[00:25:54] awesome I did it I did a a blindfolded
[00:25:57] puzzle has anyone ever done that before
[00:26:00] I don't know if I could do that with
[00:26:01] puzzles that are much harder than this
[00:26:03] but uh maybe I should try what do you
[00:26:05] think did you like this video was it
[00:26:07] relaxing interesting should I try harder
[00:26:10] puzzles obviously I can't do puzzles
[00:26:11] that involve reading but uh if there's a
[00:26:14] tactile element to it like this one this
[00:26:16] one was actually perfect for that maybe
[00:26:19] uh slowly I'll just be turning into
[00:26:20] Chris ramsy here need a bigger beard
[00:26:23] more tats got to get tats on my hands I
[00:26:25] guess that makes this less interesting
[00:26:27] right the overhead yeah anyways give
[00:26:29] keybox some love go check out their
[00:26:31] website I'll put their information in
[00:26:33] the description um they have some
[00:26:34] awesome puzzles clearly uh they're super
[00:26:37] fun and uh yeah hope you like this video
[00:26:41] smash like subscribe all the things and
[00:26:44] I'll see you in the next video I'm out

=== Memory Champ reacts to @extraemily MEMORIZING 1000 DIGITS OF PI! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj_ldWmvMzw

[00:00:00] all right I think I'm live am I live I
[00:00:04] should be live anyways uh what's going
[00:00:07] on uh my name's Nelson uh I never do
[00:00:10] these live things but I figured might be
[00:00:13] cool to do something a little different
[00:00:14] for once and uh you know the other day I
[00:00:18] was just minding my own business and
[00:00:21] somebody a friend of mine sent me a link
[00:00:24] to this streamer who I'm a little bit
[00:00:26] familiar with uh extra Emily or Emily
[00:00:30] extra did I get that
[00:00:32] wrong extra Emily sorry and uh she
[00:00:36] memorized a thousand digits of pie
[00:00:38] apparently which is cool because I don't
[00:00:41] think she's a memory athlete or anything
[00:00:43] like that um and the stream was like 12
[00:00:46] hours long so um I don't I didn't know
[00:00:50] my friend sent this to me with no
[00:00:52] context so I didn't know if she did it
[00:00:54] or not how she did it what kind of
[00:00:55] techniques she used if any um if it was
[00:00:58] Brute Force um or if she had already
[00:01:01] known them she was just reciting them I
[00:01:03] don't know so I wanted to see this
[00:01:05] because it doesn't get uh it doesn't
[00:01:08] happen too often where um mainstream
[00:01:12] kind of things happen with memory you
[00:01:14] know I try to make the mainstream but
[00:01:17] it's a different level here so she's a
[00:01:19] pretty big streamer um this video alone
[00:01:22] got 400,000 views and climbing and I
[00:01:25] think uh during the stream she had you
[00:01:28] know 10,000 people
[00:01:31] viewing at a time which is insane so um
[00:01:35] this is amazing and I want to watch it
[00:01:37] and react to it I haven't seen it I
[00:01:39] don't know the result of it I don't know
[00:01:40] much about Emily at all um I think I see
[00:01:44] I saw her um playing Super Mario 64 back
[00:01:47] in the day learning how to speedrun that
[00:01:49] but that was a while back and I could be
[00:01:51] mistaken but um I haven't seen anything
[00:01:54] else she's done I just looked at some of
[00:01:55] her videos I know she's done other
[00:01:57] challenges that's kind of her thing but
[00:02:00] of a memory related so this is the first
[00:02:01] time she's actually doing something like
[00:02:03] this which is cool anyway so I fig we
[00:02:06] watch some of it together I'm not going
[00:02:07] to watch all 12 hours um I might go back
[00:02:10] and watch it myself at some point but um
[00:02:13] basically let's let's see what's going
[00:02:14] on I'm most curious if she a does it to
[00:02:18] completion thousand digits perfect and
[00:02:21] how she freaking did it like what did
[00:02:22] she do to get there um and I hope we see
[00:02:25] some memory techniques in here so let's
[00:02:28] uh take a look here
[00:02:33] okay so I I've already jumped to about
[00:02:37] 30 minutes in and you can see right here
[00:02:39] she's already referencing the Dominic
[00:02:41] method which is awesome okay so we have
[00:02:43] a thousand digits of pi all right and uh
[00:02:47] got to memorize the numbers so I was
[00:02:49] worried that she was just doing it by
[00:02:50] Brute Force looks like she did a bit of
[00:02:53] her homework um again I don't know if
[00:02:56] she looked this up on the stream but she
[00:02:59] knows what she's doing if she's going to
[00:03:01] use a Dominic method do Dominic system
[00:03:04] to create her number
[00:03:07] system uh she knows that that's in the
[00:03:09] end going to be faster I would imagine
[00:03:11] it's probably going to confuse her
[00:03:14] viewers here because they're probably
[00:03:15] like why are you g to memorize this
[00:03:17] other thing when you got to memorize the
[00:03:19] Thousand digits right um so let's just
[00:03:22] watch a little bit here so I think she's
[00:03:24] just kind of explaining or learning to
[00:03:26] herself uh what the Dominic system is
[00:03:28] which is just a transation between
[00:03:30] digits uh and and
[00:03:55] letters yeah that's the system right
[00:03:57] there okay
[00:04:00] so these these
[00:04:04] numbers number is
[00:04:06] a so that's
[00:04:08] good
[00:04:23] then1 yeah so okay so it seems to me
[00:04:26] that she does not have a system in place
[00:04:28] which is wild so I cannot imagine
[00:04:32] sitting down for 12 hours and um you
[00:04:35] know one thing is to go ahead and
[00:04:37] memorize thousand digits but a second
[00:04:38] thing is to start it off by memorizing
[00:04:42] this entire other list of 100 well
[00:04:44] arguably 300 things um but she seems
[00:04:48] pretty confident that this is going to
[00:04:50] work I wonder where she got the
[00:04:52] inspiration for this to to to know and
[00:04:54] to think like yeah this is going to be
[00:04:56] the mode of attack um but I like her
[00:05:00] she's smart she knows what she's doing
[00:05:04] um yep so groups of six groups of six is
[00:05:08] how she's going to memorize her story
[00:05:09] this I think this a really good method
[00:05:11] it's just like it's GNA take a while
[00:05:16] yeah it's be
[00:05:20] num yes so usually when I teach people
[00:05:22] this method um you know I give them a
[00:05:25] table to fill out of all of their
[00:05:28] persons actions and objects and it takes
[00:05:32] a while it's not easy to come up with
[00:05:34] all of these
[00:05:39] combinations okay M Palace all
[00:05:43] right but I just thought of this that
[00:05:45] like you know usually when I give people
[00:05:48] this task to create their system they're
[00:05:50] doing it by themselves she's got a whole
[00:05:52] chat of thousands of people watching
[00:05:54] that probably can help her which is
[00:05:56] really clever actually it's like kind of
[00:05:58] uh what do you call call it when you do
[00:06:00] get um a group to kind of community to
[00:06:04] help you come up with something what's
[00:06:06] what's the word I'm looking for
[00:06:08] um uh I'm blanking on it but anyways
[00:06:11] yeah so very smart of her to do this
[00:06:13] actually
[00:06:22] live I want to see what she does for her
[00:06:24] first image here
[00:06:38] um is represent o and that is O is a hey
[00:06:47] that's my same o
[00:06:50] image I wonder what the action is let's
[00:06:56] see yes
[00:07:09] sorry let me put the volume here a
[00:07:11] little
[00:07:14] higher what is an action that oie osor
[00:07:17] does that just he does does he like
[00:07:19] drink a
[00:07:20] lot he like he like
[00:07:23] drinks he eats B that's my image I he
[00:07:28] did uh
[00:07:34] I
[00:07:35] think
[00:07:38] Circle be Circle
[00:07:42] gles yeah usually I recommend if you
[00:07:44] know your action is eating bats that
[00:07:46] your object should just be the bats um
[00:07:50] just makes it a little easier but yeah I
[00:07:52] guess I can see them also with those
[00:07:53] tiny little glasses too so nice um I'm
[00:07:57] not going to watch all of her images
[00:07:58] here but let's kind of skip ahead and
[00:08:02] see oh by the way this is this is what a
[00:08:05] thousand digits of pi looks like it
[00:08:06] actually doesn't look too bad when you
[00:08:07] see it like this um but it does take you
[00:08:11] know if I were to say it myself um from
[00:08:14] memory when I'm really well rehearsed I
[00:08:17] can do it in under 10 minutes um again
[00:08:21] it's not it's still in a place of where
[00:08:22] I have to pull it out of my memory
[00:08:24] Palace but it um still pretty quick and
[00:08:28] I say it in groups of five
[00:08:30] um but it would take me like maybe eight
[00:08:32] seven minutes I think six minutes might
[00:08:34] be my fastest but
[00:08:37] um
[00:08:38] the if if you're painstakingly doing it
[00:08:42] you know slowly digit by digit which I
[00:08:45] don't know we'll see by the end how fast
[00:08:47] she does it um it's going to take her
[00:08:49] quite a bit of time maybe 20 30 minutes
[00:08:51] to do all thousand but here it is all
[00:08:54] right let's Jump Ahead
[00:08:57] uh yoga
[00:09:00] in like a in her
[00:09:02] Brown
[00:09:04] jumpsuit yeah I can't put throw cat
[00:09:06] there's no
[00:09:09] way uh thank you that was a great L
[00:09:12] cover okay okay we got it we got it okay
[00:09:17] so it is memorable at
[00:09:22] least like a
[00:09:26] brown from what I see here like a lot of
[00:09:29] the
[00:09:38] are
[00:09:39] a playing Among Us with the suit
[00:09:43] on
[00:09:49] AA it's tough man it's tough to learn
[00:09:53] this on the Fly is the other thing I'm
[00:09:56] realizing is that you know this
[00:10:00] it really distinguishes kind of our ages
[00:10:03] I don't know how old she is but she
[00:10:04] looks a lot younger than I am my images
[00:10:06] I feel like are so old like not current
[00:10:08] at all and it really says when I came up
[00:10:11] with my system because I have like
[00:10:13] former presidents that are dead uh are
[00:10:17] they maybe um or just like they were
[00:10:21] popular at the time they're kind of like
[00:10:22] not that relevant anymore um so some of
[00:10:26] these images obviously she has Arnold
[00:10:27] Schwarzenegger there but I have well and
[00:10:29] hathway I know who that is but some of
[00:10:31] these images like uh Ben Affleck I guess
[00:10:34] I don't know what these are what is
[00:10:37] greeding I don't even know what that
[00:10:39] means um Snoop Dog Santa Claus Steven
[00:10:43] Spielberg Shy Guy okay I know some of
[00:10:45] these I don't know what sh emote is
[00:10:49] uh Harry Styles I mean I know who that
[00:10:52] is Hendrick Lamar yeah H chubby Orlando
[00:10:55] broom Bloom okay yeah
[00:10:57] so it's kind of cool like if whenever
[00:11:00] you make this in your life it's probably
[00:11:02] going to be relevant to what's kind of
[00:11:04] pop cultur at the time so I would
[00:11:07] imagine someone so uh in the mix of
[00:11:11] twitch and streaming is going to be
[00:11:12] quite uh um up to dat with very mem
[00:11:17] worthy and and uh pop cultur things so
[00:11:24] anyways all right let's fast forward
[00:11:26] here
[00:11:33] all right I apologize for her media
[00:11:35] shares here those are not
[00:11:40] mine all right but it looks like she's
[00:11:42] going through different six combinations
[00:11:44] and just writing
[00:11:51] out oh see I wonder if she's actually
[00:11:54] using a Memory Palace I I I haven't
[00:11:56] heard her mention that and it looks like
[00:11:59] like she's just writing out all the
[00:12:00] images I wonder if it's just one big
[00:12:02] story um which is hard that is hard um
[00:12:06] although I will say when you do this for
[00:12:08] the very first time
[00:12:10] um which he is apparently it's G to be
[00:12:14] memorable as [ __ ] because it's going to
[00:12:15] be so new and novel and everything's
[00:12:18] just going to be so weird and stuff you
[00:12:20] probably never thought of before um like
[00:12:23] J LeBron James on a talk show wearing
[00:12:25] Gandhi's red robe thing I mean you can't
[00:12:29] forget that right if you've never
[00:12:30] thought such weird things before um so
[00:12:33] perhaps you know if she never uses a
[00:12:35] Memory Palace maybe she doesn't need
[00:12:37] that that's tricky because if you miss
[00:12:40] one piece of the story you you miss a
[00:12:41] whole chunk of numbers obviously whereas
[00:12:43] with a Memory Palace you at least know
[00:12:46] that where every chunk of numbers should
[00:12:48] be um this is incredible so I'm curious
[00:12:52] how many she's doing at a time here
[00:12:55] let's see
[00:12:58] [Music]
[00:13:05] s let's fast forward here like 80
[00:13:08] something have memorized okay so she's
[00:13:12] doing it in chunks
[00:13:14] here is doing the soldier
[00:13:16] boy with his dead head okay bye it's
[00:13:22] going to take me so long but we'll do it
[00:13:26] kudos to her man for doing this this is
[00:13:28] this is rough this is
[00:13:33] tough1
[00:13:41] 3145 okay okay so she had a chunk kind
[00:13:43] of like on automatic there
[00:13:47] okay H
[00:13:49] is
[00:13:53] so
[00:13:56] three uh two
[00:13:59] yeah
[00:14:04] uh you can see her brain just like
[00:14:07] working on overdrive right
[00:14:10] now no sorry 9 okay
[00:14:15] 9
[00:14:17] uh
[00:14:21] Z two wow yeah
[00:14:51] [Music]
[00:14:53] nice all right let's fast forward a
[00:14:56] little bit here thank where did she get
[00:15:01] all right so I guess she's just making
[00:15:03] them she's making different parts of all
[00:15:06] these numbers as she goes and kind of
[00:15:08] testing herself let's jump around a bit
[00:15:14] here
[00:15:16] see okay so it looks like she's gone
[00:15:18] through 300 here I guess she's just
[00:15:20] creating all the images up to 300 and
[00:15:23] then testing herself then going a little
[00:15:25] further man
[00:15:31] five hours in that is impressive
[00:15:36] I like if I was doing this live like any
[00:15:39] memory task like I'd be stressed you
[00:15:41] know just i' I'd be like embarrassed
[00:15:45] that people are bored or something but
[00:15:46] like she gives zero [ __ ] I love that
[00:15:50] she's just doing her thing and people
[00:15:51] are watching in dross it's amazing uh
[00:15:56] let's see
[00:15:59] and she's a
[00:16:00] machine wait okay she is this like the
[00:16:07] full let's see oh over here it says the
[00:16:09] digit she's on
[00:16:17] 3379 oh she's over here can you see my
[00:16:20] cursor yeah oh no
[00:16:26] 09 oh here we go 175 5 3
[00:16:30] six 4
[00:16:45] [Music]
[00:16:56] three this is good let's let's jump
[00:16:59] where did she go
[00:17:07] to where is she five over here 5
[00:17:13] seven
[00:17:20] 5 curious chat what do you what do you
[00:17:23] think do you think you could do
[00:17:24] this would you take on this Challenge
[00:17:27] and then we go into the kitchen
[00:17:31] I can see the comments yeah if you if
[00:17:33] you put a comment there I'll I'll I'll
[00:17:35] mention
[00:17:39] it see if she'll get to 500
[00:17:45] here9 and
[00:17:49] then
[00:17:52] is damn she has her system down I've
[00:17:54] been so
[00:17:57] impressed uh with redy hair
[00:18:03] three
[00:18:07] one
[00:18:10] four come on uh
[00:18:13] 91 oh my God almost
[00:18:19] there all right she must have made a
[00:18:21] mistake
[00:18:22] somewhere oh 505 she messed up so
[00:18:26] close where are my two
[00:18:30] than all right let's jump around a bit
[00:18:32] here oh so her personal best to this
[00:18:35] point oh she made a mistake I guess was
[00:18:38] 357 let's
[00:18:40] go okay so seven hours in she's just
[00:18:43] doing multiple attempts this is wild
[00:18:47] uh I don't know if anybody's ever done
[00:18:49] anything like this honestly like
[00:18:51] obviously people have learned Pi but to
[00:18:53] do it live uh on a stream like this
[00:18:55] before with such an audience that's so
[00:18:58] impressive
[00:19:03] 600s where did she get up to oh she
[00:19:05] stopped 709 she's gonna do it there's
[00:19:09] what four more hours left on this stream
[00:19:11] for sure she gets it all
[00:19:17] done wait is this the real web page can
[00:19:20] I use that web
[00:19:23] page I want to check if that's real P
[00:19:28] 10000 what was
[00:19:35] it oh one of fans just coded that that's
[00:19:39] amazing that's
[00:19:51] awesome recite all a thousand with no
[00:19:56] mistakes
[00:19:59] that is the goal hell yeah okay
[00:20:02] the let's finish this bad
[00:20:07] boy she's
[00:20:14] reviewing
[00:20:17] watch is this the attempt is this the
[00:20:19] one where she gets it does she get
[00:20:25] it let's uh
[00:20:30] four in
[00:20:32] space so that's George Clooney which is

[00:20:50] techniques that like
[00:20:52] people find this fascinating the whole
[00:20:55] process obviously when I do a memory
[00:20:57] demonstration I just show we memorize uh
[00:20:59] recalling it because I think that's kind
[00:21:01] of what people want to see but who knows
[00:21:03] maybe people find the whole process
[00:21:06] fascinating I don't know would people be

[00:26:00] memorizing something insane and see what
[00:26:04] happens someone's asking if she's
[00:26:06] cheating I don't think she's cheating

=== fastest way to memorize the alphabet BACKWARDS! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuQFckXVNeA

[00:00:00] this is the fastest way you'll ever
[00:00:01] learn how to say the alphabet backwards
[00:00:02] first imagine a surfer dude surfing on
[00:00:04] top of six waves those waves carry him
[00:00:07] all the way across the ocean to the
[00:00:08] shores of Russia although it's the USSR
[00:00:10] although it's a discount USSR so it's UT
[00:00:13] Sr not USSR and since it's on discount
[00:00:16] there's a coupon tag dangling from it
[00:00:18] next you see a melt carton doing a jig
[00:00:20] dancing his ass off and then finally
[00:00:22] that melt carton gets fed by a passing
[00:00:24] tab with the letter A on it six waves
[00:00:26] zix waves zyx WV discount Russia UT Sr
[00:00:31] QP o n milk carton doing a jig ml k j i
[00:00:35] h g silent h fed by cab a f d CBA a
[00:00:40] that's it try yourself now there may be
[00:00:42] other more tedious ways but


=== the fastest you'll ever learn the ALPHABET BACKWARDS! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npOdlEnQuBE

[00:00:00] hey I'm going to teach you how to see
[00:00:01] the alphabet backwards it's super easy
[00:00:04] and it's a great party trick all you
[00:00:05] have to do is picture four things these
[00:00:07] four things are going to be weird images
[00:00:10] that represent the sounds of the
[00:00:12] collection of letters that will help you
[00:00:13] say the alphabet from back to front here
[00:00:16] are the images so the first one is going
[00:00:17] to be zix wave now we know the alphabet
[00:00:21] in Reverse starts with a z but I want
[00:00:23] you to picture six waves imagine you're
[00:00:25] out on the ocean and you see these big
[00:00:28] waves six waves waves kind of curling
[00:00:31] these massive six waves and so six is
[00:00:33] going to help you remember it's really
[00:00:35] zix but it's zyx and then wave you know
[00:00:38] we're going to ignore the vowels there
[00:00:39] but the W and the V that's the next two
[00:00:42] letters so zyx WV now let's imagine that
[00:00:45] you ride these six waves okay across the
[00:00:48] Pacific and you end up in Russia the old
[00:00:51] USSR it's not quite USSR anymore
[00:00:54] obviously it's Russia but for in our
[00:00:56] crazy story let's imagine it's like a
[00:00:57] discount USSR it's actually UT Sr
[00:01:01] there's a t now instead of the S and
[00:01:04] it's discount USSR right so clearly
[00:01:07] discounts need coupons so we have UT Sr
[00:01:10] coupon QP o n now once we get in the
[00:01:14] country the weirdest thing we see it's
[00:01:16] now a milk carton doing a jig MLK doing
[00:01:19] a j i g jig with a silent h in Russia
[00:01:24] somewhere finally our last image after
[00:01:26] this milk carton is doing this jig he
[00:01:28] then gets fed by a cab with the letter A
[00:01:31] on it that's f e d CB a all right let's
[00:01:36] recap forget about the alphabet what are
[00:01:38] our images we have six waves we get to
[00:01:40] Russia it's discount Russia with a
[00:01:42] coupon and then we see a mil carton
[00:01:44] dancing a jig and then he gets fed by a
[00:01:47] cab with the letter A on it
[00:01:49] CBA six waves zix waves zyx WV discount
[00:01:54] USSR utr with that coupon QP n MLK doing
[00:01:59] a jig j i h g and then fed f e d tab a
[00:02:05] CBA and now if you want to further
[00:02:07] cement that just sing it to the original
[00:02:10] alphabet song I went on Fiverr and found
[00:02:12] one that was sung by a professional
[00:02:14] played much nicer for you to jam into
[00:02:17] your brain and never forget it enjoy D
[00:02:20] YX w v u s r t b o m l k j i h g f e b g
[00:02:31] b
[00:02:34] a oh before I go if you want to learn
[00:02:36] more tips on how to memorize things like
[00:02:38] this or take advantage of your memory
[00:02:40] superpowers that you have already in
[00:02:42] there you already a memory genius you
[00:02:43] just have to unlock it I can help you do

=== testing my MEMORY with Ludacris' "Area Codes" ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WW9-MCqEkU

[00:00:00] now that I have all the US area codes
[00:00:01] memorized it only seems fitting that I
[00:00:03] should listen to ludicrous is area codes
[00:00:06] now it's been a while I don't think I've
[00:00:08] listened to this since the early 2000s
[00:00:10] but I'm curious which area codes he
[00:00:12] mentioned let's have a
[00:00:17] listen
[00:00:19] got
[00:00:21] wow this is taking me back I have not
[00:00:24] listened to
[00:00:25] this since I graduated high
[00:00:28] school
[00:00:33] different so far no area codes mentioned
[00:00:37] now you thought I was just 77 and 404
[00:00:40] 770 and 404 that is uh Atlanta makes
[00:00:44] sense I think ludicrous is from Atlanta
[00:00:45] 404 is Central classic Atlanta 770 is
[00:00:50] suburbs of Atlanta actually in case
[00:00:53] you it's the Abominable H man Globe Trot
[00:00:56] International Postman nebor dick dope
[00:00:58] man 71
[00:01:00] 202 718 202 so 718 is actually New York
[00:01:04] City technically it's the out of
[00:01:07] Manhattan buros so like Brooklyn Queens
[00:01:10] the Bronx and then 202 we're jumping to
[00:01:12] DC that is that is a great area cod
[00:01:19] 915 all right so 901 is Memphis
[00:01:22] interesting he has a hoe in Memphis
[00:01:24] that's kind of suddenly out there and
[00:01:27] 305 I mean that's my area code that's
[00:01:29] Miami FL flid I'm not surprised
[00:01:31] especially being from Atlanta that he
[00:01:33] has ho or AO I don't know if it's plural
[00:01:37] in Miami meet outside so control your
[00:01:39] hormones and keep your drawers on till I
[00:01:41] close the door and I'm jumping your
[00:01:43] bones 312
[00:01:46] 3131 83 so 312 313 312 is shy Town
[00:01:52] Chicago very famous one of the first
[00:01:54] area codes ever put out by the North
[00:01:56] American numbering plan in 1947 and uh
[00:01:59] 313 is classic Detroit 215 and 80 trees
[00:02:04] 803 so 215 what is 215 um oh that's
[00:02:08] Philly yeah that's Philadelphia and then
[00:02:11] 803 oh yeah that's like I think that's
[00:02:14] Central South Carolina so that's like
[00:02:16] Colombia what an interesting place to
[00:02:19] have a a hoe um Colombia I would assume
[00:02:22] that all of these hoes um are coming
[00:02:25] from his touring and his shows right and
[00:02:27] meeting different ladies and different
[00:02:30] parts of the
[00:02:36] country1 overlo 757 and 410 757 is uh
[00:02:42] like the southeast corner of Virginia I
[00:02:45] guess that's like Norfolk or Virginia
[00:02:47] Beach very nice beaches over there I'm
[00:02:50] sure there's some fine ladies on the
[00:02:51] beaches there and then 4100 is Baltimore
[00:02:55] Good Old Baltimore right yeah 410 is
[00:02:58] Baltimore
[00:03:01] I've got
[00:03:02] ho in different area C are
[00:03:10] area so far his
[00:03:14] reach is not that
[00:03:16] expansive now every day is a ho day so
[00:03:19] stop the violence and put the F away you
[00:03:22] the hold day4 972 713 what you going do
[00:03:27] all right so 504 we're going down to
[00:03:29] NOLA
[00:03:30] uh New Orleans and then
[00:03:32] 972 that's actually an overlay for uh
[00:03:36] Dallas this is pretty interesting
[00:03:38] because that means that this lady's
[00:03:39] probably quite young 972 is an overlay
[00:03:41] meaning that the original Dallas area
[00:03:45] code 214 can't get a number because
[00:03:48] everybody's taken all the 214 so they
[00:03:50] give you an overlay this is maybe
[00:03:52] somebody new with a cell phone coming
[00:03:54] late to the game so a younger person for
[00:03:57] example I have a 305 I got my cell phone
[00:03:59] years ago but if you were probably
[00:04:00] getting a Miami number now you couldn't
[00:04:03] get a 305 you'd have to get I don't even
[00:04:04] know if you can get a 786 you'd probably
[00:04:06] get there's another overlay now
[00:04:08] 645 so 972 for Dallas might say that
[00:04:12] this particular lady was uh on the
[00:04:15] younger side then you got 713 which is
[00:04:17] Houston peric homicide
[00:04:21] 3121 then you got 314 one of my favorite
[00:04:24] area codes because that is pi and that
[00:04:27] is St Louis that is downtown St Louis
[00:04:29] and then you got 201 that's one of the
[00:04:32] earliest area codes that is New Jersey
[00:04:34] just outside of the city bang
[00:04:37] bang so now for the next minute or so
[00:04:39] the song doesn't really reference any
[00:04:41] area codes Nate Dog comes in and does
[00:04:43] his little bits very
[00:04:46] Soulful and only once references an area
[00:04:49] code saying this
[00:04:52] line 212 New York City and the 213 is a
[00:04:56] classic LA area code the song keeps
[00:04:58] going on a little bit and then there is
[00:04:59] a smattering of area codes vomited out
[00:05:03] in this closing section of the song and
[00:05:04] it really tested my abilities check this

=== Recalling Every US Area Code from Memory (STUDY WITH ME) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up6Gtw79J4I

[00:00:00] this video was sponsored by mind lab Pro
[00:00:02] more about them throughout the video I
[00:00:04] memorized all the US area codes they're
[00:00:06] three digits each and there's over 300
[00:00:08] almost 400 spending the whole United
[00:00:10] States now we're going to put that to
[00:00:11] the test all right let's go 941 let's
[00:00:15] start off
[00:00:21] [Music]
[00:00:25] there 405 that's central Oklahoma
[00:00:30] Oklahoma City all right 224 847 that is
[00:00:35] the northern part of Chicago there we go

[00:31:47] Antonio
[00:31:49] 413 that is Western Mass we're wrapping
[00:31:52] up the ones I missed here 574 I believe
[00:31:55] is there 684
[00:32:03] uh
[00:32:04] 870 I believe is this
[00:32:07] yep
[00:32:16] 609 where is
[00:32:19] 716 716 that's
[00:32:22] Buffalo uh that's
[00:32:26] 517
[00:32:39] 430 609 that's Jersey
[00:32:42] there
[00:32:50] 351 AR
[00:32:53] no I need 903 where's 903 that's this
[00:32:58] one um
[00:33:03] 763 that's this
[00:33:05] one
[00:33:08] um what do I have
[00:33:11] here oh 480 that's this
[00:33:18] one all right and this one up here oh is
[00:33:21] 978
[00:33:23] 351 all right so what do we have 919 910
[00:33:28] we have three so I think one of them is
[00:33:30] probably an island and then I have these
[00:33:32] two here so rally who's rally George
[00:33:35] Bush no
[00:33:37] 910
[00:33:40] um I think this one is
[00:33:42] 910 yes and then
[00:33:48] 684
[00:33:49] 984 I think this is Rally yes and then
[00:33:53] six I don't know what 684 is
[00:34:03] what did I miss
[00:34:05] here 684 I got to look it
[00:34:15] up uh it's American Samoa it's not on
[00:34:19] the map so let's go find it American
[00:34:25] Samoa there it is
[00:34:28] all right 236 out of 244 some of them I
[00:34:31] accidentally pressed the wrong thing but
[00:34:33] it took me 34 minutes
[00:34:46] nice


=== I Tried To Memorize Every Area Code (ft. RAINBOLT) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LulHdW8kwk

[00:00:00] I am teaching one of the best geoguesser
[00:00:02] players in the world Trevor rainbolt how
[00:00:04] to memorize all of the area codes in the
[00:00:07] United States we know it really yep all
[00:00:11] of them
[00:00:15] oh I'm okay and if you don't know who
[00:00:18] Trevor raybolt is he has one of the most
[00:00:20] amazing and entertaining Tik Tok YouTube
[00:00:22] channels out there and all from just
[00:00:24] playing this game called geoguesser
[00:00:25] where you basically get this random
[00:00:27] Google street image and you have to plun
[00:00:29] it on a map where you think that the
[00:00:30] location is just from the photo now
[00:00:32] Trevor takes it to the extreme he'll
[00:00:34] look at one of these images for a
[00:00:35] fraction of a second and he can tell you
[00:00:37] exactly what country and where in that
[00:00:38] country it is on the map it is wild
[00:00:40] guessing where I am on Google Maps but
[00:00:42] only using the grass but in
[00:00:45] 0.001 seconds but the image is black and
[00:00:47] white pixelated and I can only see
[00:00:50] telephone polls what the hell so I
[00:00:53] invited Trevor rainbolt onto my kilara
[00:00:55] trip cuz I thought you know this guy
[00:00:57] likes to travel he needs to familiarize
[00:00:59] himself self with geolocations of the
[00:01:02] mountain we are here at Kil Manjaro the
[00:01:04] entry gate mashami route and he's going
[00:01:06] to climb to the top of Kil Manjaro and
[00:01:08] I'm going to teach him all the US area
[00:01:10] codes while we're climbing the mountain
[00:01:12] yeah there are 3177 it's a lot and with
[00:01:15] the added extra challenge that his brain
[00:01:17] is going to be thumping from the
[00:01:20] altitude as they go to the summit of Kil
[00:01:22] majara things didn't go to plan for a
[00:01:24] number of reasons one I tried using a
[00:01:26] new camera and everything is out of
[00:01:28] focus
[00:01:31] everything nice the second thing is he
[00:01:33] actually did not feel good after day
[00:01:36] three or so how was your hike thought it
[00:01:38] started off easy I'm like about this is
[00:01:39] steady and that last mile we we did I
[00:01:41] was like I was talking my talk way too
[00:01:43] early Karma it did not it was not easy
[00:01:45] we did it maybe overestimate how hard
[00:01:48] doing some mental task like memorizing
[00:01:50] so many numbers would be when you're
[00:01:52] trying to battle altitude and headaches
[00:01:55] Montana Montana uh 40 uh I remember
[00:02:00] trying to coach him on like day three or
[00:02:01] 4 and he was just sulking their uh head
[00:02:05] in his hands and he seemed alert but
[00:02:07] then later he told me like I don't
[00:02:09] remember anything you said cuz I was not
[00:02:11] paying attention my head was throbbing
[00:02:13] so we quickly realized that this was a
[00:02:15] bad idea and um I re-evaluated and when
[00:02:18] we got back we had a call and I said
[00:02:21] listen I need to redo this video it's
[00:02:23] fine because the whole thing was that on
[00:02:25] the mountain we just got carried away
[00:02:27] with the mountain it's hard to do
[00:02:29] anything when your brain is feeling like
[00:02:31] it's being squeezed so let's redo it
[00:02:34] right I don't have to teach you
[00:02:35] everything again you kind of know my
[00:02:37] Approach the idea would be that you know
[00:02:40] I give you a certain amount of time and
[00:02:41] you can see if you can do it on your own
[00:02:43] what do you think yeah I think a week I
[00:02:45] think what we do at the end is we uh we
[00:02:47] do a geog or kind us like Urban One V
[00:02:51] one or something that'd be good yeah
[00:02:52] we're going to set a deadline in a week
[00:02:54] from now seven days we're testing this
[00:02:56] again nice we'll take that and if you're
[00:02:58] wondering if you summoned it or not he
[00:03:00] made it to the top brother he did dude
[00:03:02] it's real I've never been more proud of
[00:03:05] myself it was the hardest thing I've
[00:03:06] ever done in my life by far and now for
[00:03:09] something completely
[00:03:12] different now before we go any further I
[00:03:14] think it makes sense to do a little
[00:03:16] history on area codes let's do this area
[00:03:19] codes a brief
[00:03:21] history it's 1947 it's a time when
[00:03:25] rotary phones were The Cutting Edge
[00:03:27] technology and the nation is
[00:03:28] experiencing a war boom in population
[00:03:31] and
[00:03:32] telecommunication you decide to call
[00:03:34] your friend who's across the country
[00:03:36] when you realize oh there are more
[00:03:38] people with phones now than there are
[00:03:40] possible combinations of seven
[00:03:43] digits so they implement the North
[00:03:46] American numbering plan they being the
[00:03:48] American Telephone and Telegraph company
[00:03:51] AT&T for those of you not from the US
[00:03:53] this is just a phone service company
[00:03:54] that's basically had a monopoly on
[00:03:56] everything phone related in the 20th
[00:03:58] century anyway
[00:04:00] so they came up with this North American
[00:04:01] numbering plan back in 1947 had like 82
[00:04:05] to 85 or something codes for the whole
[00:04:08] United States most States just had one
[00:04:10] code and actually the convention was
[00:04:13] that any state that had just one code
[00:04:15] had a zero in the middle so like Montana
[00:04:18] was 406 Florida was 305 and then any
[00:04:21] state that had multiple area code would
[00:04:23] have a one in the middle like New York
[00:04:25] had 212 Albany area was then 518 West
[00:04:28] like Buffalo area was like like 716 so
[00:04:30] basically an area code is a three-digit
[00:04:32] number that goes before the seven-digit
[00:04:34] number that indicates where you are in
[00:04:36] the country thank you now fast forward
[00:04:40] to today this is what the area code map
[00:04:42] looks like so many numbers all three
[00:04:44] digits right there's actually about 300
[00:04:46] to 400 different codes here and that's
[00:04:49] always increasing right as the
[00:04:50] population increases but what you'll
[00:04:52] notice is some places like Montana here
[00:04:54] very sparse population only needs one
[00:04:57] area code for the whole state 406 on the
[00:04:59] flip side you have a place that's really
[00:05:01] densely populated like Manhattan and you
[00:05:03] have a bunch of codes there you have 212
[00:05:06] 646 332 even 917 that's just for
[00:05:09] Manhattan for the Burrows you even have
[00:05:11] 718 347 917 as well 929 and that's just
[00:05:14] in the area of New York City you know
[00:05:17] whenever I'm trying to memorize
[00:05:18] something I'm looking for patterns so if
[00:05:19] there's some pattern to how these
[00:05:21] numbers were delegated maybe I can take
[00:05:22] advantage of that I'm learning that
[00:05:24] instead uh turns out no this makes my
[00:05:27] job harder but I can still do it
[00:05:30] okay so now what do we do next well I
[00:05:32] got to learn it so you know what
[00:05:33] actually the first thing I need to do is
[00:05:34] figure out which ones I already know
[00:05:36] once I know that I know the ones I
[00:05:37] actually have to memorize so let's go do
[00:05:40] that I got this website here from Trevor
[00:05:43] actually um let me record this but
[00:05:46] basically it's a map of the United
[00:05:48] States I think it's going to quiz me on
[00:05:50] all of the area codes and I just got to
[00:05:52] find it on a map so yeah I don't think
[00:05:54] I'm going to know very many here but
[00:05:56] this is what this is all about I guess
[00:05:57] in the future this is what I want to be
[00:05:59] able to Ace so let's take a look right
[00:06:02] okay so
[00:06:04] 231 yeah uh that should be a I I don't
[00:06:08] know
[00:06:12] 716 I don't know
[00:06:15] 207 I feel like I should know that uh
[00:06:19] maybe it's Maine it is Maine okay 253
[00:06:24] 719 uh 91 jeez I don't know any of these
[00:06:27] so it's quite clear that I don't know
[00:06:30] very many I got to learn a ton over
[00:06:32] 300 which isn't too bad what's my mode
[00:06:35] of attack well it just so happens that I
[00:06:37] personally have a number system where
[00:06:39] every three digits is a person a
[00:06:42] character a human an animal something
[00:06:45] that is in my own experience of life and
[00:06:48] memory I've Associated every three-digit
[00:06:49] possibility with one of those people
[00:06:51] each one of those area codes I can just
[00:06:53] assign the person to something about the
[00:06:55] state or the area of the state for
[00:06:58] example 31 six is the area code for
[00:07:01] Witchita Kansas my image is RoboCop and
[00:07:04] I connect that to or link it to witcha
[00:07:07] witch reminds me or sounds like witch so
[00:07:10] for whatever reason I think of The
[00:07:12] Witcher which is played by Henry caval
[00:07:14] so I picture Robocop and Henry caval as
[00:07:16] a Witcher just beating the crap out of
[00:07:18] each other 316 witcha another example of
[00:07:21] 502 which is Louisville Kentucky 502 is
[00:07:25] the Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars and
[00:07:28] Louisville I had a dog named Lou one
[00:07:30] time so I picture the emperor and my dog
[00:07:33] Lou eating some Kentucky Fried Chicken
[00:07:35] and that helps me remember that 502 the
[00:07:38] emperor oh is in Louisville Kentucky now
[00:07:41] what I taught Trevor on the mountain was
[00:07:42] a little bit different since he doesn't
[00:07:44] have a three-digit system and most of
[00:07:46] you don't if you want to try this
[00:07:48] another alternative and this is pretty
[00:07:50] quick to set up is just to give a code
[00:07:52] to the numbers specifically the digits 0
[00:07:54] through 9 all right it's mostly based on
[00:07:56] the alphabet so one is an a two is a B
[00:07:59] three is a c four is a d five is an e
[00:08:02] six is the only exception it's an S just
[00:08:05] cuz six and S kind of sound VAR seven is
[00:08:08] a G8 is an h and then nine also an
[00:08:10] exception an N just cuz nine is very n
[00:08:13] Sound okay and then zero is just an O
[00:08:15] cuz it looks like an O and with those I
[00:08:17] can make little words for example
[00:08:20] 414 would be dad so whatever 414 is I
[00:08:24] think it's Minneapolis or something I
[00:08:26] don't know what is
[00:08:27] 414 oh it's Milwaukee okay so Milwaukee
[00:08:31] it could be as simple as me picturing my
[00:08:32] dad going for a little walk little walk
[00:08:34] take my dad for a little walk 414 d d
[00:08:37] dad little walkie on a leash you get the
[00:08:39] idea and then Atlanta I know is 404 so
[00:08:41] that would be d o maybe that's
[00:08:43] Department of Defense Atlanta I don't
[00:08:45] know the Atlanta Braves you think of
[00:08:47] something brave for defense Department
[00:08:50] of Defense something like that this will
[00:08:51] get a little tricky cuz you got to dig
[00:08:53] for a unique word and that's not always
[00:08:55] the case I remember making some of these
[00:08:57] images for Trevor on the mountain and
[00:08:58] some of were really hard all right we're
[00:09:00] here up on top of lava Tower which is
[00:09:02] one of the prominent features here I
[00:09:04] mean look at this killes up there there
[00:09:06] she is so some examples Denver is 303 so
[00:09:10] that's uh very memorable so we just
[00:09:12] picture um a lot of a lot of
[00:09:15] in Denver Portland is a lock we picture
[00:09:18] a lock on the weather it's always rainy
[00:09:20] there so it's locked in so lock
[00:09:22] translates to
[00:09:24] 53 just to give you some
[00:09:27] flavor yummy
[00:09:29] now here are a few more examples rapid
[00:09:31] fire style that I was able to teach
[00:09:33] Trevor while on the mountain you ready
[00:09:35] it's going to be fast so follow along
[00:09:37] here we go first we got 603 that
[00:09:39] translates to S so sock New Hampshire
[00:09:41] New Hampshire looks like a sock Montana
[00:09:43] is 406 that's do or Doss I feel like in
[00:09:46] Montana it's so rural everybody who
[00:09:48] lives up there has a computer that's
[00:09:49] still running Doss 405 is Oklahoma City
[00:09:51] 405 translates to do or doll so I have a
[00:09:54] picture in the middle of Oklahoma there
[00:09:56] is a meat cleaver chopping a doll in
[00:09:58] half 504 is New Orleans and that
[00:10:00] translates to l r which I could continue
[00:10:02] on the word Lord of the Rings lord of
[00:10:05] the New Orleans Rings 312 is Chicago
[00:10:08] that's a cab I just picted taking a cab
[00:10:10] in Chicago it's filled with cabs that
[00:10:11] bottom part of Alabama that little
[00:10:13] little thing that's 251 which is BLT and
[00:10:16] it kind of looks like a camel toe so I'm
[00:10:17] going to picture that it is a BLT with a
[00:10:20] camel toe in
[00:10:21] it you're welcome enough with the
[00:10:23] explanation I need to get started
[00:10:25] memorizing this stuff because I'm
[00:10:26] meeting with Trevor in a few days and if
[00:10:28] I don't get started he is going to kick
[00:10:30] my ass so without further Ado cue the
[00:10:32] memorization
[00:10:42] Montage pretty good first
[00:10:44] [Music]
[00:10:48] pass yes memory Champs use flash card
[00:10:51] sometimes Act of me making the flash
[00:10:53] cards easiest study hack of all time
[00:10:55] will actually further cement the numbers
[00:10:57] in my mind
[00:10:59] [Music]
[00:11:09] [Applause]
[00:11:10] [Music]
[00:11:11] [Applause]
[00:11:12] all right I think I'm done after a few
[00:11:14] days of studying these numbers backwards
[00:11:15] forwards inside out I feel like I've got
[00:11:17] them down to the best of my ability I am
[00:11:20] ready to take on the best geog guesser
[00:11:22] in the world by the way do you remember
[00:11:23] that map that I failed so miserably
[00:11:25] earlier well I finally nailed it so if
[00:11:27] you want to check it out in its entirety
[00:11:29] check out the link above or in the
[00:11:30] description it's a really long video
[00:11:32] it's boring and nerdy so I'm not going
[00:11:34] to include it here but I will test you
[00:11:36] on some of the area codes that I've
[00:11:37] mentioned throughout this video I want
[00:11:39] to see if you were paying attention and
[00:11:40] if you remember them what was
[00:11:43] 504 that was New Orleans l o r Lord of
[00:11:48] the Rings what was
[00:11:50] Denver Denver had loads of Cox cooc 303
[00:11:55] what about
[00:11:57] Chicago there were C ABS in Chicago cab
[00:12:01] 312 what about
[00:12:04] 414 414 is d a your dad was taking a
[00:12:08] little walkie in Milwaukee let's do one
[00:12:10] more where was
[00:12:12] 251 translates to BLT that BLT at the
[00:12:16] bottom of Alabama nice job anyways onto
[00:12:19] the match with Trevor three days later
[00:12:21] dude I I have two roles my strategy is
[00:12:23] if I don't know what it is just guess
[00:12:24] New Jersey or Texas cuz I feel like for
[00:12:26] some reason like New Jersey has like a
[00:12:29]  ton that like I just forget
[00:12:31] sometimes in Texas I just like Texas is
[00:12:33] a beast so after a few pleasantries and
[00:12:35] deciding on some rules we got started
[00:12:37] best of five matches so first to three
[00:12:40] on a geog guesser map that only shows us
[00:12:42] area codes on billboards or some kind of
[00:12:44] signage simple enough the only thing we
[00:12:46] had to agree on as gentlemen was if we
[00:12:48] got a non-visible sign we choose Brazil
[00:12:51] so we both got zero points kind of like
[00:12:53] avoided round what if I guess closer in
[00:12:55] Brazil than you I I I tested the setting
[00:12:58] and it's below the equator is uh zero
[00:13:00] points so ready yep I'm I'm locking in
[00:13:02] so if I don't talk I'm just focus I I
[00:13:06] really want to Lo do it all right okay
[00:13:08] round one all right the first round
[00:13:10] started off hot out of the gates with
[00:13:12] both of us knowing them pretty well I
[00:13:14] got hit with one I knew but somehow just
[00:13:16] forgot that's massive oh it was Anaheim
[00:13:19]  nice one that was a bad one he
[00:13:23] then missed a large one guessing Ohio
[00:13:25] when it should have been St Louis oh bro
[00:13:27] what I don't know this oh bad
[00:13:31] Missouri oh dude look at this game oh
[00:13:34] dude now it was suddenly a close game
[00:13:35] but he secured the win after I flubbed
[00:13:37] on an area code that I should have known
[00:13:38] you know this one yeah I should have
[00:13:41] known this we even talked about it on
[00:13:43] the mountain extensively
[00:13:47] oh of course game that's the one that I
[00:13:50] don't have a image for I just know so
[00:13:52] Trevor went up 1 z f of course just we
[00:13:55] can it was close it was just a bad guess
[00:13:57] at the end let's do it again round two
[00:13:59] round two was not Trevor's best game I
[00:14:02] got them all right but he made quite a
[00:14:03] few flubs his first was getting 321
[00:14:06] wrong he thought it was Orlando but it's
[00:14:08] actually more to the east wait why the
[00:14:10] East there am I dumb and then he got hit
[00:14:12] with two big losses guessing New Jersey
[00:14:14] when it was Indiana
[00:14:17] no yes no okay okay okay lock in lock in
[00:14:20] lock in lock in and then 27 he told me
[00:14:24] he confuses the ey States so he was a
[00:14:26] bit far east and that cost him the game
[00:14:29] I get the eyes confused I get Indiana
[00:14:31] Illinois Iowa always freaking confused
[00:14:33] oh yeah yeah if it's one of those it's
[00:14:35] not too far you're not going to lose
[00:14:36] that many points right is that n or 17
[00:14:40] dang it I always I always get the ey the
[00:14:43] eyes confused Bro GG's I was good
[00:14:47] one1 now these next two rounds round
[00:14:49] three and round four were super
[00:14:51] interesting round three went crazy long
[00:14:53] we were neck and neck just chipping away
[00:14:55] at each other's score up to 28 rounds
[00:14:57] but in the end it went to Trevor
[00:14:59] damn good one one round four however was
[00:15:02] kind of crazy could say I beat the
[00:15:04] geoguesser champion Trevor rainbolt in a
[00:15:07] two rounder no well that's a big one oh
[00:15:11] no
[00:15:13] no I was York and then switched
[00:15:17] no yes o he's going to live in shame for
[00:15:20] that one all right was it two two all
[00:15:22] right two two all right this is it oh
[00:15:24] we're going in game game seven NBA
[00:15:26] Finals right here so we were tied two
[00:15:28] two going into the final game doesn't
[00:15:30] get more exciting than this started the
[00:15:31] round started close a bunch of area
[00:15:33] codes that we both knew pretty well then
[00:15:35] I flubbed on 616 I don't know what I was
[00:15:37] thinking there ah
[00:15:41] yeah no no that he made a surprising
[00:15:46] error on 415 which is pretty generally
[00:15:48] known to be San
[00:15:49] Francisco no
[00:15:52] oh all right why I think that was
[00:15:55] Bakersfield we got 206 that's easy
[00:15:57] that's Seattle then made two mistakes in
[00:15:59] a row o and then 407 to me I've grown up
[00:16:03] with people from Orlando so I know 407
[00:16:05] just happened to be in my favorite there
[00:16:06] nson if you know this I might be going
[00:16:09] back to the locker
[00:16:10] room oh no dude I had to get 200 points
[00:16:13] I cannot choke this lead bro that would
[00:16:16] be so bad keep he seemed to forget it
[00:16:19] and uh yeah the rest is history no no
[00:16:23] way oh yes there's no way wow oh oh man
[00:16:29] Orlando dude if you want to watch the
[00:16:32] whole match round for round no cuts no
[00:16:35] nothing no voice over whatever I'll put
[00:16:37] a link up in the corner here and I'll
[00:16:39] put a link in the description as well
[00:16:40] well that was close now seriously that
[00:16:42] was awesome uh Trevor is such a good
[00:16:44] sport for even going up against me and
[00:16:46] for letting me go up against him that
[00:16:47] could have gone either way I forgot some
[00:16:49] he forgot some it was really awesome to
[00:16:51] spend time with him on the mountain to
[00:16:52] talk shop and how he learns things and
[00:16:54] for me to learn from him for him to
[00:16:56] learn from me and I think you'll be
[00:16:57] seeing him in a few more of my videos
[00:17:00] down the road for sure oh hey and if

=== how I memorize poems (quick recap) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBp5l6QuGi0

[00:00:00] as a five-time USA memory champion this
[00:00:02] is how I memorize poems first I read the
[00:00:04] damn poem obviously but I really try to
[00:00:06] read it I try to understand it try to
[00:00:08] see what it's describing then I
[00:00:10] memorized the poem using a Memory Palace
[00:00:12] usually line by line but only the
[00:00:14] keywords or ideas from each line my
[00:00:16] first pass is always the basic skeleton
[00:00:18] of the poem for example in the poem I
[00:00:20] memorized the first line was out of the
[00:00:22] night that covers me all I memorized was
[00:00:24] night and covers once that's done I do
[00:00:27] another read through just to
[00:00:28] contextualize everything that I just
[00:00:29] memorized then I do another pass and
[00:00:32] this time I add more detail to my images
[00:00:34] than I just placed In My Memory Palace
[00:00:36] to help me remember some of the other
[00:00:37] words and then finally I practice and
[00:00:40] perform the crap out of it until it's
[00:00:41] muscle memory that's it make sure to
[00:00:43] check out the full video on YouTube for
[00:00:45] more details


=== This is how I memorize poems (fast) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Cr964IR3g

[00:00:21] [Music]
[00:00:29] I just made a video where I talked about
[00:00:31] how powerful it can be to memorize a
[00:00:33] poem but in this video I'm going to talk
[00:00:35] about how I actually memorize the poem
[00:00:37] and how you can do it as
[00:00:40] [Music]
[00:00:44] well so the poem I had memorized was
[00:00:47] called Invictus and the method that I
[00:00:49] used to memorize it was using a Memory
[00:00:52] Palace now if you're familiar with my
[00:00:53] channel you've seen me talk about memory
[00:00:55] palaces over and over again so if you
[00:00:57] need a refresher just search my channel
[00:01:00] [Applause]
[00:01:02] so the poem has four stanzas each of
[00:01:04] four lines that's 16 lines total so My
[00:01:07] Memory Palace consisted of 16 locations
[00:01:10] one line per location now in this video
[00:01:14] I'm going to go through all the images I
[00:01:15] created to memorize this poem and I
[00:01:17] encourage you to follow along with your
[00:01:19] own Memory Palace so you can memorize
[00:01:21] the poem as well while also learning how
[00:01:23] I generally approach memorizing
[00:01:25] something like a poem now the Memory
[00:01:27] Palace that I use is a apartment SLT
[00:01:29] house that I'm familiar with so it won't
[00:01:31] really mean much to you and then
[00:01:32] whenever I come up with my image for the
[00:01:34] line just place it in your memory Palace
[00:01:37] instead of mine now there's a bit of a
[00:01:39] process to this whole thing it's not as
[00:01:40] simple as just coming up with all these
[00:01:42] images poems are hard since we're trying
[00:01:44] to memorize it word for word all these
[00:01:47] little words and word order
[00:01:50] matter so that means that My Memory
[00:01:53] Palace is really just going to be
[00:01:55] holding very basic imagery to just
[00:01:57] capture the essence of what each line
[00:02:00] says or means and then after that first
[00:02:04] pass of memorizing the basic structure
[00:02:07] what I'm going to do is another pass
[00:02:08] where I start to Pepper in all the
[00:02:11] details of all those extra filler words
[00:02:13] that fill up and make the actual line up
[00:02:15] so adding a few more images to the
[00:02:17] images I already have in more detail so
[00:02:20] that the line becomes more complete I'll
[00:02:22] show you what I mean by example we're
[00:02:24] going to go through the whole poem line
[00:02:25] by line all the images that I came up
[00:02:28] with in my first pass I'll share them
[00:02:30] with you and then I'll also show you
[00:02:32] during the second pass what I might add
[00:02:34] to fill out those images now this is the
[00:02:37] process I did to memorize and recite the
[00:02:39] poem that you saw me do in my last video
[00:02:42] If you haven't seen that video by the
[00:02:43] way you should watch it it's very
[00:02:45] [Music]
[00:02:58] nice now the very first thing you have
[00:03:00] to do before you memorize anything is to
[00:03:02] read the damn poem have a proper read
[00:03:05] through the poem and while you're doing
[00:03:07] it actively read it try to understand
[00:03:10] what the author is trying to say what
[00:03:12] the poem is trying to express if
[00:03:14] possible you know sometimes these poems
[00:03:16] can be so abstract really hard to read
[00:03:18] but do your best try to find information
[00:03:20] about what the poem was originally
[00:03:22] intended for if you could learn more
[00:03:24] about the poem get excited or interested
[00:03:26] about the poem that'll make the whole
[00:03:28] memorization process even easier because
[00:03:30] you'll have this meta knowledge about
[00:03:33] what the poem means and a lot more
[00:03:35] context about the whole thing so once
[00:03:37] you've learned about the poem once
[00:03:39] you've read through the poem actively
[00:03:42] now you're ready to use your memory
[00:03:43] Palace and start laying down that
[00:03:49] Foundation hi all right so the first
[00:03:52] line of this poem is out of the night
[00:03:54] that covers me now that's a very simple
[00:03:57] line but again for this first pass I
[00:03:59] don't care about all the little minutia
[00:04:01] of that line all the little words I'm
[00:04:02] just going to take the general idea and
[00:04:04] usually that can come down to maybe
[00:04:06] grabbing a word or two that pop out at
[00:04:09] me or the just the main concept or a
[00:04:11] group of words that make a small phrase
[00:04:13] and I'll encode that as an image and
[00:04:14] that'll be my image that I place at my
[00:04:16] location In My Memory Palace so for this
[00:04:18] line that would be the night covering so
[00:04:21] my image will be literally some kind of
[00:04:23] blanket of night some Darkness some
[00:04:26] night covering me and I would place this
[00:04:28] or imagine this happening at the first
[00:04:30] location of My Memory Palace Now My
[00:04:32] Memory Palace this townhouse the first
[00:04:34] location is kind of out front by the
[00:04:36] front door on this kind of patio outdoor
[00:04:38] area so I'm standing at the front door
[00:04:40] outside there and then all of a sudden
[00:04:42] this kind of blanket of night this night
[00:04:44] covers me and it's complete darkness and
[00:04:47] I'm tired cuz it's night that's it again
[00:04:49] this is the first pass I don't care
[00:04:50] about the detail just a brief image to
[00:04:52] lay the foundation and then I move on to
[00:04:54] the next
[00:04:55] line line number two black is the pit
[00:04:59] from pole to pole now the next location
[00:05:02] In My Memory Palace as I walk through
[00:05:03] the door of this townhouse immediately
[00:05:05] to my right is this else shaped couch
[00:05:08] and I'm going to picture for this line a
[00:05:11] black pit so to me I think of like the
[00:05:14] pit of some kind of uh fruit right and
[00:05:17] it's black as can be pitch black black
[00:05:20] pit and then I have that phrase pull to
[00:05:22] pole so I might imagine taking this
[00:05:24] black pit putting it on the couch and
[00:05:26] bashing the out of it with a pole
[00:05:28] black pit pole that's
[00:05:31] it I think whatever Gods may be that's
[00:05:35] the next line and it's pretty
[00:05:37] straightforward line my next location is
[00:05:39] after the couch there's kind of a bar
[00:05:41] counter area where I put my laptop and I
[00:05:44] do some of my work so I can just imagine
[00:05:46] that at the counter I'm answering my
[00:05:47] emails and I'm thanking Gods so I'm just
[00:05:50] emailing one God after the other and
[00:05:52] just saying thank you thank you thank
[00:05:53] you I'm thanking the
[00:05:57] gods for my unconquerable Soul so the
[00:06:00] next location after the bar counter kind
[00:06:02] of extends into the kitchen that same
[00:06:04] counter now is next to the sink and so
[00:06:06] what I might imagine is there is this
[00:06:09] kind of floaty ghostlike Soul immovable
[00:06:13] just standing there by the sink on that
[00:06:16] counter it's unconquerable can't move it
[00:06:19] can't shake it can't defeat it can't get
[00:06:21] rid of it it's
[00:06:23] unconquerable in the fell clutch of
[00:06:25] circumstance and so after the sink now
[00:06:28] I'm next to the fridge so I'm going to
[00:06:30] picture for fell clutch I think of like
[00:06:32] a clutch like the clutch of a car is
[00:06:34] falling has fallen has fell and
[00:06:37] Circumstance I might think of like
[00:06:38] circum navigate just to help me remember
[00:06:40] the circum something so I might imagine
[00:06:43] that this clutch just Falls right in
[00:06:45] front of the fridge and starts to
[00:06:48] circumnavigate uh on its own around this
[00:06:50] fridge so fell clutch circum navigate
[00:06:54] even though it's
[00:06:56] circumstance I have not winced nor cried
[00:06:59] aloud now the next location next to the
[00:07:02] fridge there's kind of like this back
[00:07:03] door that goes into the hallway of the
[00:07:06] condominium and I might picture that
[00:07:08] maybe I stubbed my toe on the door or
[00:07:10] something like that and I have not
[00:07:13] winced nor cried aloud in pain and
[00:07:16] actually to maybe stress the word winced
[00:07:19] cried aloud maybe I do actually wince
[00:07:21] and cry aloud when I stub my
[00:07:24] toe I love this line under the
[00:07:27] bludgeonings of chance
[00:07:29] now my next location next to the door is
[00:07:32] a little folding door that leads to like
[00:07:34] a little Pantry so bludgeoning I know to
[00:07:36] mean you know to beat something and
[00:07:39] chance kind of hard to visualize so I
[00:07:41] might make the image a little more
[00:07:42] tangible and make it Chance the Rapper
[00:07:45] all right so I can imagine in front of
[00:07:46] this Pantry maybe Chance the Rapper is
[00:07:49] trying to get a little snack and I say
[00:07:51] uhuh no snacks for you Chance the Rapper
[00:07:53] and I bludgeon the crap out of it so
[00:07:57] bludgeonings chance the rapper my head
[00:08:00] is bloody but unbowed now the next
[00:08:03] location after the pantry you walk down
[00:08:05] a little bit back towards the front door
[00:08:07] and there's a staircase but Under the
[00:08:08] Staircase is kind of like a little cubby
[00:08:11] bookshelf so that's the next location
[00:08:13] head is bloody unbowed are kind of the
[00:08:16] things that pop out at me and so I'm
[00:08:18] going to picture bloody head and then
[00:08:21] unbowed it's kind of hard to visualize
[00:08:23] but the word bow or bow I might picture
[00:08:25] an actual bow to help me remember that
[00:08:27] word now again with these images they
[00:08:28] don't always have to be exactly what the
[00:08:31] word means my goal is to remember these
[00:08:34] key words so that I say them when I
[00:08:36] perform this so unbowed is a very odd
[00:08:39] word I wouldn't usually say kind of hard
[00:08:42] to remember that one so if I can picture
[00:08:44] a bow that will help cue the word bow or
[00:08:47] bow or unbowed now in this bookshelf I'm
[00:08:50] just going to picture a bunch of bloody
[00:08:51] heads with bows stuck to them as if
[00:08:53] they're all presents or something like
[00:08:57] that okay now that we're about halfway
[00:09:00] through the poem you get the idea of how
[00:09:01] I'm coming up with these images so let's
[00:09:03] pick up the pace just a little
[00:09:05] bit beyond this place of Wrath and tears
[00:09:08] so we're coming around up the stairs now
[00:09:11] to the second floor so on the stairs I'm
[00:09:13] going to place this image and Beyond
[00:09:16] makes me think of two infinity and
[00:09:17] beyond so I think of buzzl Lightyear so
[00:09:20] Buzz Light ear is on the stairs and
[00:09:22] wrath and tears so I can just imagine
[00:09:25] buzzl light ear just causing so much
[00:09:27] wrath absolutely and tears
[00:09:29] looms but the horror of the shade now
[00:09:32] for this one loom I think of like the
[00:09:35] device you use to like weave thread into
[00:09:38] fabric a loom and horror and shade are
[00:09:41] kind of the two other Concepts that
[00:09:42] stick out at me horror makes me think of
[00:09:44] like a horror film so I immediately
[00:09:46] think of the scream character so that's
[00:09:48] my image for horror and then shade just
[00:09:50] like somebody in the shade so maybe the
[00:09:52] loom is being operated by the scream guy
[00:09:55] and uh he's kind of in the shade and
[00:09:57] this is happening at the top of the
[00:09:59] stairs on the second floor the staging
[00:10:01] area there's the loom with the scream
[00:10:03] guy in the
[00:10:04] shade and yet the Menace of the years so
[00:10:08] now this line after you are upstairs you
[00:10:09] then go into the bathroom and there's a
[00:10:11] mirror on the left hand side so this is
[00:10:14] where my next location is and yet the
[00:10:17] Menace of the years so for me I think of
[00:10:19] the word yet is important and then
[00:10:21] Menace so I'm going to imagine yet it's
[00:10:24] hard to picture so I might picture like
[00:10:26] a Yeti yet Yeti and this Yeti is a
[00:10:30] menace so you can imagine in front of
[00:10:31] this mirror maybe he's thrashing about
[00:10:33] maybe he's cracking the mirror maybe
[00:10:35] he's putting lipstick and makeup all
[00:10:36] over the mirror he's a menace this Yeti
[00:10:39] is a
[00:10:40] menace finds and shall find me unafraid
[00:10:43] and so this is the end of that third
[00:10:45] stanza we are now opposite the mirror in
[00:10:47] this bathroom there's like a glass
[00:10:49] window shower thing so I'm going to
[00:10:51] picture something to do with find and
[00:10:53] unafraid so maybe I can imagine like I'm
[00:10:55] looking in the shower trying to find
[00:10:58] something and I'm unafraid maybe it's a
[00:11:00] disgusting shower covered with hairs and
[00:11:03] pubes all over the wall really
[00:11:05] disgusting and I'm out to find these
[00:11:08] things and I'm trying to be unafraid of
[00:11:12] what I find oh my God God
[00:11:17] damn it matters not how straight the
[00:11:19] gate so now we've come out of the
[00:11:21] bathroom we're going towards the bed
[00:11:22] there's a bedside table that's the next
[00:11:24] location and I'm going to place this
[00:11:27] image of a straight gate so I'm going to
[00:11:29] imagine actual gate miniature gate on
[00:11:32] this bedside table and it's as straight
[00:11:34] as can be straight edges all the
[00:11:36] vertical bars of this gate are perfectly
[00:11:38] straight no curves no bends nothing
[00:11:41] straight straight gate that's
[00:11:44] it how charged with punishments the
[00:11:47] scroll so for this one I'm kind of
[00:11:49] gravitated towards charged punishments
[00:11:52] scroll so for charge I think of like
[00:11:54] something electrically charged and
[00:11:57] there's this scroll with a list of
[00:11:58] punishment ments on them being beheaded
[00:12:00] drawn and quartered lethal injection and
[00:12:03] the scroll if you touch it you get
[00:12:04] electrocuted cuz it's charged and so the
[00:12:07] next location is next to the bedside
[00:12:08] table it's actual bed itself so on the
[00:12:11] bed is this scroll with a list of
[00:12:13] punishments and it's electrically
[00:12:15] charged so if you try to touch it you
[00:12:17] just get
[00:12:21] electrocuted I am the master of my fate
[00:12:24] if you go to the other side of the bed
[00:12:25] there's kind of like a banister that
[00:12:26] looks down to the first floor of the
[00:12:28] loft so I'm going to picture Metallica
[00:12:30] playing Master of Puppets all set up
[00:12:33] there on the banister and they're just
[00:12:34] going at it playing Master of Puppets
[00:12:36] now I want to remember Master and fate
[00:12:38] fate is kind of hard to visualize but it
[00:12:41] kind of sounds like faint like fainting
[00:12:42] imagine Metallica the entire band is
[00:12:44] just playing master puppets until they
[00:12:47] faint I am the captain of my soul that's
[00:12:50] the last line and after the banister you
[00:12:52] kind of make your way to the very back
[00:12:55] corner of the second floor and there's
[00:12:56] like a door to go to the balcony that's
[00:12:58] the last location Captain makes me think
[00:13:00] of like Captain America of course soul I
[00:13:03] just think of a soul so maybe this
[00:13:05] Captain America is by the back door
[00:13:07] there and he's like guarding that door
[00:13:09] so much so that his soul escapes
[00:13:13] him and that's it we've just memorized
[00:13:15] the basic structure of this 16 line poem
[00:13:20] cool all right so should we recap that
[00:13:24] let's go back through our Memory Palace
[00:13:25] and you go through yours I'll go through
[00:13:27] mine and we'll see if we can come up
[00:13:28] with the same image is so the first
[00:13:29] location we were at the front door there
[00:13:32] was the night covering me we walk in
[00:13:35] there's the couch there we had the black
[00:13:37] pit and beating it with a pole then we
[00:13:40] go to the counter the Third location I'm
[00:13:42] on my computer typing thanks to Gods
[00:13:45] then we continue near the sink on the
[00:13:46] counter there unconquerable Soul then we
[00:13:49] go to the fridge we had the falling
[00:13:51] clutch and the circum navigating then
[00:13:54] the door I stubbed my toe winced cried
[00:13:57] aloud then the pantry tree bludgeoning
[00:14:00] Chance the Rapper under the stairs in
[00:14:01] the cubby there the bookshelves we had
[00:14:03] bloody heads with bows on them up the
[00:14:06] stairs we had Beyond to infinity and
[00:14:08] beyond buz Lightyear wrath and he was
[00:14:11] crying tears we go upstairs to the
[00:14:13] platform the loom being operated by
[00:14:16] scream guy Horror in the shade then the
[00:14:19] bathroom by the mirror we had the yeti
[00:14:20] that was a menace opposite that in the
[00:14:22] glass shower we were finding things and
[00:14:26] we were unafraid then we went to the
[00:14:27] bedside table the Straight Gate the bed
[00:14:30] charged punishment scroll the banister
[00:14:33] was Master of Puppets Master faint fate
[00:14:37] and then finally the back door we had
[00:14:39] Captain America Soul Captain
[00:14:42] Soul there it is now hold on a second
[00:14:45] here all right now what do we do with
[00:14:48] that because that's not the actual poem
[00:14:51] right just little Snippets of words here
[00:14:53] no so the next thing you do is you go
[00:14:55] back through the poem and read all the
[00:14:57] lines and so now everything you've just
[00:14:58] place in your memory Palace you can add
[00:15:00] a little more context by what you read
[00:15:02] but that second read through now that
[00:15:04] you've memorized some of it will
[00:15:06] actually help naturally land some more
[00:15:08] of those words for you without having to
[00:15:10] memorize much more but it is important
[00:15:12] to do another readr once you've done
[00:15:13] that first pass now that second pass I
[00:15:17] mentioned earlier all right now you go
[00:15:19] back through your memory Palace you can
[00:15:22] start to add some more details to the
[00:15:24] images that you already have there to
[00:15:25] help you remember some of the other
[00:15:27] Concepts or words in that line for
[00:15:29] example under the bludgeonings of chance
[00:15:32] so our image was bludgeoning Chance the
[00:15:34] Rapper but now maybe you want to
[00:15:36] remember that it's under the
[00:15:38] bludgeonings of chance right so that
[00:15:40] word under is important so maybe what
[00:15:43] you do instead of imagining beating
[00:15:45] Chance the Rapper like this maybe you
[00:15:47] imagine that you're using a stick or
[00:15:49] something and you're going under you're
[00:15:50] beating him from underneath from down up
[00:15:52] subtle difference but you're just
[00:15:54] tweaking the image that you already had
[00:15:55] there and so now you will remember that
[00:15:57] it's under bludgeonings chance and now
[00:16:00] what about those other words under the
[00:16:02] bludgeonings of chance right so these I
[00:16:05] call filler words now some of those will
[00:16:07] just naturally come because the line
[00:16:09] won't be under bludgeonings chance you
[00:16:12] almost naturally want to say under the
[00:16:14] bludgeonings of chance now whether it's
[00:16:16] a uh or the or an of or an if or that or
[00:16:20] this or those or which these tiny little
[00:16:22] words can maybe get confused with
[00:16:24] practice and rehearsing those will come
[00:16:27] and then the rest of it my
[00:16:29] friends it's practice it is a
[00:16:32] poem after all it's a performance you're
[00:16:34] going to recite it and insert emotion
[00:16:38] and feeling and thought and intellect
[00:16:40] into how you say the words it's not just
[00:16:43] a straight robotic recall it's a poem
[00:16:47] and just like being fluent in a language
[00:16:49] or fluent in any information you have to
[00:16:51] rehearse it you have to practice for it
[00:16:53] to become part of you to just come out
[00:16:57] and feel natural and unfortunately that
[00:17:00] won't come from extracting it from a
[00:17:02] Memory Palace The Memory Palace
[00:17:03] technique is very important though uh to
[00:17:05] get you to that point because once you
[00:17:07] can get that information in your head
[00:17:09] you have a place from where you can
[00:17:11] rehearse it easier and there will be a
[00:17:13] point where you've access this poem so
[00:17:15] many times from your memory Palace that
[00:17:17] eventually it's just automatic just
[00:17:19] muscle memory and that's where you want
[00:17:21] this poem to be in the
[00:17:26] end so that's my process for memorizing
[00:17:30] any poem or any speech or text or or
[00:17:33] toast or whatever anything to do with
[00:17:34] text there's a Memory Palace component
[00:17:37] there's a big repetition part of it and
[00:17:40] there's a lot of reading and analyzing
[00:17:43] and trying to get interested and
[00:17:46] understand the thing that I'm reading
[00:17:48] that's a big part of it but anybody can
[00:17:50] do it and this can be done quite quickly
[00:17:53] to learn that poem for example only took
[00:17:55] me about 10 15 minutes and then of
[00:17:58] course you know I had to do a few
[00:17:59] rehearsals to get it really nice and
[00:18:01] tight but ultimately it didn't take very
[00:18:03] long so that's it for this video I hope
[00:18:05] you liked it make sure to watch the
[00:18:06] video where I actually recite this poem
[00:18:08] over some nice scenery of the mountains
[00:18:10] and the Himalayas uh you can check that
[00:18:12] video out here I'll put it in the
[00:18:14] description and uh thanks for a great
[00:18:16] year everybody I'll see you next year
[00:18:18] I'm the master of my fate I'm the
[00:18:20] captain of my soul

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:11] [Music]
[00:00:40] good morning this is a bit of a
[00:00:42] different video um really a
[00:00:46] reminder uh of the power of memorizing
[00:00:49] things in this day and age you'll see in
[00:00:52] a moment there's a little sequence I put
[00:00:53] together that's pretty moving and
[00:00:55] important to me uh I didn't really know
[00:00:57] what to do with it but I realized it
[00:00:59] needed a voice voice over and it needed
[00:01:02] a powerful message and I thought of a
[00:01:05] poem that um I've always wanted to
[00:01:07] memorize uh it's one that's stuck with
[00:01:09] me for many years as I've climbed and
[00:01:11] failed on mountains and had hard times
[00:01:14] and kind of try to stick through it so I
[00:01:16] memorized that poem earlier today and uh
[00:01:19] I wanted to recite it to you now if
[00:01:21] you're interested in how I actually
[00:01:22] memorize this I'll do another quick
[00:01:24] video and just kind of going through the
[00:01:25] pneumonics but not in this video the
[00:01:28] real point of this video is to say how
[00:01:30] powerful it can be to internalize
[00:01:33] something you know I love this poem I've
[00:01:36] always loved hearing it um I've kind of
[00:01:38] known some of the words but not fully
[00:01:41] but until I just memorized it uh it
[00:01:43] became a part of me and there's some
[00:01:46] power in that it feels like that poem is
[00:01:49] now mine and it lives within me and
[00:01:51] nobody can take that away from me yeah I
[00:01:53] could have looked it up whenever I
[00:01:55] wanted on Google or Wikipedia but I
[00:01:57] don't need to it's up here it's a part
[00:02:00] of me it's part of who I am and what I
[00:02:02] know and I love that feeling and that's
[00:02:04] a very human feeling and experience and
[00:02:06] I encourage you guys to go out there
[00:02:08] find something you want to memorize and
[00:02:10] do it just for the sake of doing it and
[00:02:11] so that you have it for yourself that's
[00:02:15] all I want to say I hope you
[00:02:28] enjoy
[00:02:32] [Music]
[00:02:35] out of the night that covers me black is
[00:02:38] the pit from pole to

=== Best Nootropics for Brainpower (brain supplements I take and why) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnJE0xNO_iU

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:00] so I decided to make this video because
[00:00:02] so many of you have asked me what
[00:00:03] supplements I take if any and if I do
[00:00:06] why do I take the ones that I do the
[00:00:08] answer
[00:00:10] is yes no but seriously there's one
[00:00:14] supplement I take these days and I've
[00:00:15] been doing so for the last few years
[00:00:18] mind lab Pro you've seen them sponsor my
[00:00:20] videos you've heard me talk about them
[00:00:22] you may have even seen them supporting
[00:00:24] me break Guinness World Record I talk
[00:00:25] about them extensively while that's nice
[00:00:27] and all I don't take just any supplement
[00:00:30] in fact I came to them because I love
[00:00:32] their products so much performance lab
[00:00:34] which is the name of the company that
[00:00:35] makes mind lab Pro and other products is
[00:00:37] known by many as the neut tropics
[00:00:39] company due to their emphasis on brain
[00:00:41] power which makes sense because brain
[00:00:43] power is the epitome of human
[00:00:44] performance right why I approach them
[00:00:46] and trust them is because of the quality
[00:00:48] and efficacy of their products
[00:00:50] everything they make is clean label
[00:00:51] certified and third party tested for
[00:00:53] Purity and potency it's plant-based
[00:00:55] vegan certified and they're a certified
[00:00:57] benefit Corporation or bore they make a
[00:00:59] number of nut neut Tropic based products
[00:01:01] but these are the ones that I've used
[00:01:02] and enjoyed so mind lab Pro which I talk
[00:01:04] about all the time which is an advanced
[00:01:06] neut Tropic scientifically proven to
[00:01:07] boost brain power I'll talk about that
[00:01:09] in just a minute omega3 which is a daily
[00:01:12] brain health and performance supplement
[00:01:13] and the nice thing about it it's omega-3
[00:01:15] is direct from The Source ocean algae
[00:01:17] then they have their new Tropic bars I
[00:01:19] love these things they call them the
[00:01:21] world's smartest energy bar it's
[00:01:22] Norwegian black oats which is 40% richer
[00:01:25] in efas fortified with essential brain
[00:01:27] nutrients like omega-3 from algae
[00:01:30] vitamin D and b12 and
[00:01:33] [Music]
[00:01:38] more now honestly here's the thing there
[00:01:40] are a bajillion new Tropic Brands out
[00:01:43] there the thing that makes performance
[00:01:44] lab stands out from all the rest in my
[00:01:46] opinion is the research and development
[00:01:48] that backs their product many new Tropic
[00:01:50] Brands site research all over their
[00:01:52] websites plastered everywhere on this
[00:01:54] ingredient and that ingredient but
[00:01:55] performance laab is the only one at
[00:01:58] least the only one I've seen who's done
[00:01:59] research on their actual product as a
[00:02:02] whole their specific neut Tropic blend
[00:02:04] and the studies they've been a part of
[00:02:06] are saying things about performance lab
[00:02:08] products specifically not just the
[00:02:10] individual ingredients and that to me is
[00:02:12] super cool and ballsy Dr Utley from
[00:02:16] Leeds who helped conduct the research
[00:02:18] literally says the following the main
[00:02:20] benefits have been that taking M lab Pro
[00:02:23] for for only for only a month actually
[00:02:26] um improves your ability to make
[00:02:28] decisions particularly in terms of um
[00:02:32] reactions and choice reactions it
[00:02:35] improves your ability to um to
[00:02:38] anticipate when things are happening in
[00:02:40] the environment it also improves your
[00:02:42] memory and there are many subcomponents
[00:02:45] of memory but it particularly improves
[00:02:47] um immediate recall and delayed recall
[00:02:51] and what we found was that people who
[00:02:53] had been taking the Mind lab Pro were
[00:02:56] much better at dealing with a with a
[00:02:58] context where the there were more than
[00:03:00] one stimulus which they' got to respond
[00:03:02] to 30 days a whole month that's it
[00:03:05] anyways that's what I take and why if
[00:03:07] you feel so inclined to give it a try
[00:03:08] yourself they've got a Black Friday deal
[00:03:10] all the way through the end of November
[00:03:12] and if you're watching this past
[00:03:13] November well shame on you for not
[00:03:15] watching my video
[00:03:16] sooner I'm kidding I love you and your
[00:03:19] brain have a nice

=== I taught my 5 year old the HEBREW alphabet! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6THU5-2xWo

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:06] hello hello
[00:00:09] hello this is my son and in today's
[00:00:12] video I'm going to teach him and you how
[00:00:15] to read the Hebrew
[00:00:18] alphabet what are these all right uh
[00:00:22] here you can eat these hi everybody my
[00:00:24] name's Nelson I'm a five-time USA memory
[00:00:26] champion and this guy is Axel axel he's
[00:00:30] my son my firstborn son what are you
[00:00:32] learning in school these
[00:00:36] days doing very good math yes and what
[00:00:42] are you drawing all the time you mean at
[00:00:44] lunchtime no when you come home you love
[00:00:46] you have your little books with the
[00:00:47] letters in them you're practicing what
[00:00:49] writing writing he's learning the
[00:00:53] alphabet what's your favorite letter
[00:00:56] buddy a because it's the first letter of
[00:00:59] my name dude anyways he knows his
[00:01:01] alphabet A B C D forwards he knows it
[00:01:04] backwards can you say it backwards too z
[00:01:07] y x w v u TS yeah something like that
[00:01:12] that's good I taught him that by the way
[00:01:14] so you know all the letters in English
[00:01:17] what if I were to teach you another
[00:01:19] alphabet called Hebrew does that sound
[00:01:21] cool yes you want to learn it it's a yes
[00:01:25] sure okay all right so there are 22
[00:01:27] characters in the Hebrew script and
[00:01:31] you know what I have someone better who
[00:01:32] can explain this to you okay so I
[00:01:34] decided it would be a great idea to go
[00:01:35] to the local synagogue in my town and
[00:01:37] meet with the rabbi who was kind enough
[00:01:39] to answer all my questions he went
[00:01:40] through a lot of information the thing I
[00:01:42] was most interested in was just to be
[00:01:43] able to pronounce the characters
[00:01:45] correctly I did not want to mess that up
[00:01:47] Zan z y y a
[00:01:53] s so sadii
[00:01:57] Rush R fatality give me some fascinating
[00:02:00] history on the script itself like did
[00:02:02] you know that the Hebrew actually used
[00:02:04] today is actually the Aramaic script I
[00:02:06] didn't know that and that there was
[00:02:07] actually a Proto Hebrew he brought out
[00:02:09] this whole sheet that had just like the
[00:02:10] history of the characters and like where
[00:02:12] they potentially came from going back to
[00:02:14] even hieroglyphics which was
[00:02:16] mindboggling to me it makes you think
[00:02:17] twice about the symbols that we write
[00:02:19] with that somebody at some point just
[00:02:20] sat down and was drawing really
[00:02:22] rudimentary symbols on a piece of paper
[00:02:23] that meant something and eventually over
[00:02:25] time now that's the letter A you know
[00:02:27] something like that crazy but that's
[00:02:29] that's uh that's for a uh that has
[00:02:31] nothing to do with its video there you
[00:02:32] have the Hebrew alphabet all right it
[00:02:34] was nice
[00:02:35] me all good all right we're back we are
[00:02:38] going to get started I'm going to start
[00:02:39] teaching him each of those 22
[00:02:42] characters if you want to learn how to
[00:02:45] okay things are getting out of hand we
[00:02:46] better get
[00:02:47] [Music]
[00:02:56] started all right just so you know
[00:02:59] what's about to happen in here my son is
[00:03:00] five so whatever I'm about to teach him
[00:03:02] is a very how do I say this uh very dumb
[00:03:06] down version of what I would actually do
[00:03:08] with my audience while I may teach him
[00:03:10] one thing I'll cut away and then show
[00:03:12] kind of what I would teach you or
[00:03:13] anybody learning this script from aist
[00:03:16] point of view neus is a fancy word for
[00:03:17] someone who memorizes a lot with memory
[00:03:19] techniques now keep in mind I do not
[00:03:21] speak Hebrew and I did not know the
[00:03:22] alphabet before researching for this
[00:03:24] video but such is the power of memory
[00:03:26] techniques I learned it in about 5
[00:03:29] minutes granted I can't speak the
[00:03:30] language still I do know how to read the
[00:03:33] characters and make the sounds so that
[00:03:35] is what I am going to impart on you with
[00:03:37] this video where you take it from there
[00:03:38] is up to you the point is to show that
[00:03:40] these techniques can really help you
[00:03:42] learn pretty much anything in a short
[00:03:43] amount of time even if you're 5 years
[00:03:48] old these are my
[00:03:51] notes so the first one we're going to
[00:03:53] learn is called Alf what is that can you
[00:03:57] say Alf Alf and can can you guess what
[00:04:00] sound it
[00:04:02] makes oh it's the first sound of the
[00:04:05] word so a left a ah ah what's ah a so
[00:04:11] the pneumonic for this so that you
[00:04:12] remember what sound it makes and also
[00:04:14] what it looks like is to remember an
[00:04:16] elephant like an alant not an elephant
[00:04:19] but an elephant all right and it's
[00:04:22] really easy you draw a diagonal the
[00:04:24] trunk coming up like that and then the
[00:04:26] tail or you could think of that as like
[00:04:28] the hind foot or something like that so
[00:04:29] you could kind of draw it as an elephant
[00:04:31] an elephant and the sound that it makes
[00:04:33] of course is an
[00:04:35] A or as I understand it can also play
[00:04:38] the role of a silent letter can you draw
[00:04:40] it yes just copy it over
[00:04:43] there yep and then give it his elephant
[00:04:48] trunk yep and his
[00:04:51] tail good yeah and what's that one
[00:04:55] called olive olive like an elepant look
[00:04:59] how good I oh it's beautiful got check
[00:05:01] that out wow all right here we go this
[00:05:02] one is called bet bet like when you burp
[00:05:06] you go bet bet b this is how you do it
[00:05:09] you draw this and then a line at the
[00:05:11] bottom okay and you know what that looks
[00:05:13] like it's like a mouth and the burp
[00:05:15] comes out
[00:05:17] here now technically there is a bet and
[00:05:20] there is a vet I didn't teach this to
[00:05:22] Axel but they're very similar sound so
[00:05:24] you'll find there's a lot of characters
[00:05:25] that actually have two versions of them
[00:05:27] and there's also kind of like a final
[00:05:29] version if is at the end of the word
[00:05:30] we'll talk about that but technically
[00:05:31] the BET has what we call a dagesh which
[00:05:35] is a diacritic or fancy word for a dot
[00:05:37] in the opening of that letter which
[00:05:39] makes it a plosive sound as Rabbi Maron
[00:05:42] taught me so if you ever want to
[00:05:43] remember when there is the dot it's more
[00:05:45] the more pive short sound of that letter
[00:05:48] versus the longer lasting sound so if
[00:05:51] you think of a B versus a v they're very
[00:05:52] similar in where they come from in your
[00:05:54] mouth but the B ends it's done right but
[00:05:57] the V is kind of like a longer smoother
[00:06:00] sound so the dot makes it kind of short
[00:06:02] which is the B and then the V is the
[00:06:04] longer sound without the dot now how do
[00:06:06] I remember this well I told him it kind
[00:06:08] of looked like somebody's opening their
[00:06:09] mouth very rudely and burping and that
[00:06:11] burp sound was a bet like a belch I know
[00:06:14] it's kind of gross but you like that one
[00:06:16] can you draw that one
[00:06:20] yeah yep and make sure yeah there you go
[00:06:23] and we can learn our first Hebrew word
[00:06:25] here where we have an Olf a bet
[00:06:30] and then another olive which is the word
[00:06:33] ABA which means dad and again we're all
[00:06:36] about images here and this is how we
[00:06:37] remember things so if you want to
[00:06:38] remember that ABA is Dad just imagine
[00:06:41] your dad listening obsessively to
[00:06:45] Aba the next one is called you ready for
[00:06:48] this yes gimmel gimmel gimel what does
[00:06:52] that sound like to you camel kind of
[00:06:54] like a camel but it's a camel with a g a
[00:06:57] g gimel Gamel so you draw draw his head
[00:07:01] and his first legs and then here's his
[00:07:03] back legs there in terms of making it
[00:07:06] memorable I told Axel that gimmel sounds
[00:07:08] kind of like camel which is funny
[00:07:11] because if you look at the Proto Hebrew
[00:07:13] actually the word gimmel comes from some
[00:07:16] character that looked like or stood for
[00:07:18] Camel but I think a better one is to
[00:07:20] think of the sound G like a goal and
[00:07:23] gimmel makes me think of like gim me
[00:07:25] like give me something gimmel a goal so
[00:07:27] it kind of looks like a guy kicking a
[00:07:29] soccer ball oh that's a different and
[00:07:32] they've turned it right around he's like
[00:07:34] give me a give me a score give me a give
[00:07:36] me a goal that'll help you remember gim
[00:07:38] gimme and the g sound all right next one
[00:07:41] is called dallot dallot dallot kind of
[00:07:44] sounds like our last name right but it
[00:07:47] has two L's yeah what sound do you think
[00:07:50] this letter makes d d okay it doesn't
[00:07:52] look like a d though look at this you
[00:07:54] draw a line yeah and another line now
[00:07:57] doll it to me kind of sounds like a doll
[00:07:59] like to doll it I don't know what to
[00:08:02] doll it means other than maybe make it
[00:08:03] look like a doll but in the terms of
[00:08:05] this character to make it doled up I
[00:08:07] might just imagine that there's a bunch
[00:08:09] of dolls kind of sitting on this kind of
[00:08:11] looks like a table picture a bunch of
[00:08:13] dolls kind of lined up across the top of
[00:08:16] that shelf let's call it that's been
[00:08:18] doll it too all right let's do one more
[00:08:21] letter and then we're going to take a
[00:08:22] break so this next one is called hey hey
[00:08:26] what does that sound like like the real
[00:08:29] hey that hores are cowsy oh that's a
[00:08:32] good one yeah okay this is what it looks
[00:08:34] like so you draw like a little
[00:08:36] house and then a little wall here to
[00:08:39] keep the horses in for all their hay and
[00:08:41] you could think of this kind of like a
[00:08:43] barn area where you maybe stack some hay
[00:08:45] and that little line in the front is
[00:08:47] like a barn door that kind of keeps it
[00:08:49] closed right and it's kind of like half
[00:08:50] open it's not a full door it's a half
[00:08:52] door hence the hay and this character of
[00:08:54] course makes a h h sound can you draw
[00:08:56] that
[00:08:58] letter
[00:08:59] yep and then the little Barn Door good
[00:09:01] that's a hay all right you get the idea
[00:09:03] I don't want to bore you with all the
[00:09:04] little chitchat that I did with my son
[00:09:06] to teach him these characters so we're
[00:09:07] going to go through the rest of the
[00:09:08] characters a little faster just so that
[00:09:10] you can get them in your brain as well
[00:09:12] on to the rest of the characters let's
[00:09:15] go all right the next character is VAV
[00:09:18] and the proper way to draw this is
[00:09:19] really just kind of a horizontal line
[00:09:21] and then straight down the best way I
[00:09:22] think to remember this as an adult is to
[00:09:25] think of the champagne v c it's a very
[00:09:27] good champagne v v kind of sounds the
[00:09:29] same to me it helps me remember the V
[00:09:31] sound next we have Z which kind of looks
[00:09:34] like VAV but technically a horizontal
[00:09:37] line and then a down so very similar to
[00:09:39] VAV except there's a little overhang
[00:09:40] there now this makes the sound Z like a
[00:09:43] z I like to think that it kind of sounds
[00:09:44] like Zion and Zion makes me think of
[00:09:46] Zion National Park so maybe you could
[00:09:48] imagine the shape of this character is a
[00:09:50] rocky structure that you might see in
[00:09:52] the park I don't know that's not the
[00:09:53] best ponic but some of these are tough
[00:09:55] this is my favorite letter this is and
[00:09:57] it basically looks like hey but it's
[00:10:00] closed right remember hey had the open
[00:10:01] Barn Door this one is now closed it kind
[00:10:03] of looks like an end if you want to
[00:10:05] think about it but there's no extra line
[00:10:06] sticking up at the top the way I taught
[00:10:07] this to axle is was kind of a weird
[00:10:10] sound for him for anybody who doesn't
[00:10:11] know this kind of sounds like hat just
[00:10:13] with more of a throaty sound to it so I
[00:10:15] said you know what just make that little
[00:10:17] dude's hat right little dude's hat next
[00:10:21] we have t which kind of has this little
[00:10:23] hook it wraps around and then goes
[00:10:24] straight up and I like to think if I
[00:10:26] turn it on its side it kind of looks
[00:10:28] like a tent right you have the base of
[00:10:30] the tent that keeps it kind of flat and
[00:10:32] then you have this kind of Dome kind of
[00:10:34] housing area and then the opening right
[00:10:36] cuz you got to get out of the tent and
[00:10:37] tent kind of sounds like T right T tent
[00:10:40] and this makes a t sound as you notice
[00:10:42] with all the names of these characters
[00:10:44] the sound that the word starts with is
[00:10:46] the sound that they make so T makes a t
[00:10:49] sound this one's called yud and this
[00:10:52] one's kind of interesting cuz it's
[00:10:53] literally just kind of like an
[00:10:54] apostrophe and this typically makes the
[00:10:56] sound y now it's the smallest letter so
[00:10:58] I had axle think of yod Yoda uh who's
[00:11:03] known to be small so if you can imagine
[00:11:06] that this little apostrophe I had him
[00:11:08] think of it like the the the Jedi sword
[00:11:10] of Yoda not that it's smaller but you
[00:11:12] could imagine this is tiny little Yoda
[00:11:14] sword yod Yoda Yoda sword all right so
[00:11:17] this letter is C and it kind of looks
[00:11:20] like bet but there's no line that
[00:11:22] extends on the bottom it's really just
[00:11:24] kind of the sideways opening now here
[00:11:26] comes the dees again if there's a dot in
[00:11:28] the middle there remember that's the
[00:11:29] posive sound so that actually makes the
[00:11:31] cuff sound all right and if it wasn't
[00:11:34] there technically that makes more of a
[00:11:37] sound maybe that's too strong a sound so
[00:11:39] very similar to to be honest I don't
[00:11:41] know when one shows up versus the other
[00:11:43] I'm just telling you what I know so I
[00:11:44] like to think cuff kind of sounds like
[00:11:46] the beginning of coffee right so this
[00:11:48] kind of looks like the coffee mug handle
[00:11:50] of a coffee mug cof yeah maybe the
[00:11:54] important thing with these techniques is
[00:11:56] to actually visualize in your mind the
[00:11:58] thing I'm telling you you so if you just
[00:11:59] kind of like yeah yeah that sounds good
[00:12:01] no no that's not it you got to think of
[00:12:04] the coffee mug and think of the handle
[00:12:05] imagine holding it and saying cuff cuff
[00:12:10] cuffy cuffy now one thing I should
[00:12:12] mention here some of these characters
[00:12:14] have what's called a final form which
[00:12:15] sounds really Advanced but uh all it
[00:12:17] really is is if this character is at the
[00:12:19] end of a word it looks a little
[00:12:21] different and kind of the trick to
[00:12:23] remembering these is these final form
[00:12:25] ones all you really do for most of them
[00:12:27] at least is you take the body you kind
[00:12:29] of rotate it out kind of takes that
[00:12:31] bottom part and drops it below like the
[00:12:34] line of where all the characters are
[00:12:36] drawing I understand nothing I like this
[00:12:41] character a lot it's called lamad and to
[00:12:43] me it looks like a llama this is the
[00:12:45] head that kind of with the long neck
[00:12:47] this is the back and this is his legs
[00:12:49] coming down from the bottom there and of
[00:12:51] course llama starts with an L kind of
[00:12:53] sounds like LED it makes the sound ah no
[00:12:56] sorry this is my favorite just because
[00:12:58] it sounds like like my favorite word so
[00:13:00] we start with a little kind of like this
[00:13:01] loose Square thing that doesn't close at
[00:13:03] the bottom and then we draw Dash there
[00:13:06] makes the sound M I like it cuz it
[00:13:08] sounds like memory so I like to think
[00:13:09] that like I'm drawing kind of a brain
[00:13:12] there or some kind of head and that
[00:13:13] little Dash that goes in is the thought
[00:13:16] or something that I'm memorizing right
[00:13:18] the idea or the fact or the Hebrew
[00:13:20] character is getting implanted into my
[00:13:23] head like a memory now this one has a
[00:13:25] final form too it kind of breaks the
[00:13:27] rule I was saying before but it's really
[00:13:29] just kind of like a box that closes all
[00:13:32] the way because you can imagine when you
[00:13:34] finalize a memory it goes into the brain
[00:13:37] and it's Clos shut it's there forever
[00:13:39] especially when you use pneumonics now
[00:13:40] one thing for sure you're wondering is
[00:13:42] where are all the vowels so the Hebrew
[00:13:44] alphabet actually doesn't use vowels per
[00:13:47] se basically just wants you to know that
[00:13:49] they happen in between all these
[00:13:51] consonant sounds now when you're
[00:13:52] learning Hebrew there are little dots
[00:13:54] and symbols that can be put around the
[00:13:55] consonant so that you know how to
[00:13:57] pronounce the words and the vowels in
[00:13:59] between these are called the nikud and
[00:14:01] that's a whole other thing I'm not going
[00:14:02] to go into that in this video but I put
[00:14:03] some resources in the description below
[00:14:06] in case you do want to
[00:14:11] know next we have nun which kind of
[00:14:14] sounds like nun like a nun or like nun
[00:14:18] kind of looks like a narrower BET right
[00:14:20] so just kind of straight down and then
[00:14:22] this little line out now to me this kind
[00:14:24] of looks like the start of drawing like
[00:14:26] say a little Pope hat and I can imagine
[00:14:27] a pope saying that there are no nuns in
[00:14:30] Judaism is that true can I say that I
[00:14:32] think that's true right so there are
[00:14:34] none nuns and this character shows that
[00:14:36] or helps you remember that not that you
[00:14:38] need to remember that amen and again
[00:14:40] this one has a final form too and all
[00:14:42] you have to do is really just rotate
[00:14:44] that bottom bit out and it just kind of
[00:14:46] is a longer nun without the line there
[00:14:49] cuz now it goes further down now we have
[00:14:51] S all right which kind of looks similar
[00:14:54] to the final form of me and kind of like
[00:14:57] T but it's close Lo so I think the best
[00:15:00] way to draw it is kind of like that so
[00:15:02] it's kind of got an overhang there and
[00:15:04] it kind of loops around me is more boxy
[00:15:07] and T of course has that opening there
[00:15:09] now the way I like to remember this is s
[00:15:11] kind of sounds like a smack I'm smacking
[00:15:14] like an open hand smack on somebody's
[00:15:16] face here what's going on
[00:15:22] I'm and you can see that little thing
[00:15:24] that kind of hangs over is like the hair
[00:15:26] that like blew back when you smacked
[00:15:28] smack them in the
[00:15:31] face this one is called a which kind of
[00:15:34] looks like a y and it's kind of one of
[00:15:37] these silent letters it kind of does the
[00:15:38] same thing as Alf I don't really know
[00:15:40] why you would use this versus the other
[00:15:41] one I apologize and to help me remember
[00:15:43] that I'm just I kind of sounds like an i
[00:15:46] in something so this kind of has this
[00:15:48] little closed cup area here so I'm just
[00:15:50] going to imagine that there's a bunch of
[00:15:51] eyes in there filling up this little Bas
[00:15:54] in here this one is pay and it kind of
[00:15:57] looks like some of the other characters
[00:15:58] we've done done but there's kind of like
[00:15:59] a little curl at the top there and
[00:16:01] remember this plosive idea the short
[00:16:03] sound versus the long so pay and Fay are
[00:16:07] actually the same character but the pay
[00:16:09] because it's a p and it's done pay has
[00:16:11] the dot right there and then if you want
[00:16:13] the softer longer sound Fay it's without
[00:16:16] and since pay sounds like you're paying
[00:16:18] somebody I like to think that you know
[00:16:20] this little hook there at the top is
[00:16:22] kind of like a hand paying money uh to
[00:16:25] this character self and then this one
[00:16:28] also has the final form so you know you
[00:16:30] can imagine that the bottom extends a
[00:16:33] little further down and then you still
[00:16:35] have that curl there this one I love to
[00:16:36] draw it's Sadi and it makes the T sound
[00:16:39] as in Pizza I know it's a z but it's a t
[00:16:43] sound so I'm just going to remember that
[00:16:45] these are little triangular slices of
[00:16:47] pizza with pepperoni on them just kind
[00:16:49] of like zigzag together help me remember
[00:16:52] that sound and then this also has a
[00:16:54] final form and again just kind of bring
[00:16:56] down the tail there and it becomes a
[00:16:57] little more vertical so it kind of looks
[00:16:59] like a backwards y this one is cough so
[00:17:01] this one has two strokes you draw one
[00:17:03] that wraps around not quite all the way
[00:17:05] and then kind of like the barn door from
[00:17:08] but it kind of goes down and the way I
[00:17:10] like to remember this since it's more
[00:17:12] like cough cough like you're coughing
[00:17:14] instead of cough which was coffee it
[00:17:16] looks like this could be a mouth and
[00:17:17] somebody's putting a hand here cuz
[00:17:19] they're coughing and you want to block
[00:17:21] that sound this next one is re and that
[00:17:23] really is just kind of this angular
[00:17:25] backwards R if you will and that's an
[00:17:27] easy one to remember because
[00:17:29] R Rush this looks like kind of like an R
[00:17:31] if you don't remember how to draw it I
[00:17:33] would maybe think of like this kind of
[00:17:34] looks like a maybe the elbow your elbow
[00:17:37] and you have a rash on your elbow even
[00:17:38] though it's not rash it's rush rush rush
[00:17:41] rush so i' be scratching that rash next
[00:17:43] one is Sheen and this one kind of looks
[00:17:45] like to me kind of like a manora just
[00:17:48] with not all the candles there and you
[00:17:50] just draw three you basically draw kind
[00:17:51] of a u shape more of like a wider U and
[00:17:54] then this one arm that kind of comes out
[00:17:56] there and what I will think of since
[00:17:57] Sheen kind of sounds like my shin I'd
[00:18:00] imagine taking a manur and hitting
[00:18:01] someone in the shin with
[00:18:04] that that would bloody hurt right with a
[00:18:07] metal candelabra hitting you in the shin
[00:18:10] ouch and technically if there is a dases
[00:18:12] on that right line it's the sheen sound
[00:18:15] and if it's on the left side it's sinen
[00:18:18] so it kind of makes that s sound another
[00:18:20] s sound again I don't know when you use
[00:18:22] which but just so you know and our final
[00:18:25] letter here is T so you draw it kind of
[00:18:27] going down like that
[00:18:28] and then there's the little J hook
[00:18:30] coming out the side there to me this
[00:18:32] looks a lot like pie and I love pie you
[00:18:34] know that now this one is the only one
[00:18:36] that kind of has that little foot
[00:18:37] sticking out there and I like to think
[00:18:39] of like you know there's a tough guy a
[00:18:40] tough guy that does like to kick from
[00:18:43] time to time this is a tough character
[00:18:44] with that kicking foot and yes it's a t
[00:18:47] sound we already had T there's T don't
[00:18:49] quite know when you use which but they
[00:18:51] both make the T sound now about those
[00:18:53] final forms those letters that have
[00:18:55] final forms there were five of them
[00:18:57] cough me M nun p and sadii now if you
[00:19:00] want to remember those quick just make a
[00:19:02] little story for those five so I had a
[00:19:04] coffee and I was memorizing stuff while
[00:19:06] I was drinking coffee then a nun walked
[00:19:08] in to pay for some pizza the pizza is
[00:19:11] the sound reminds me of sadii that's it
[00:19:14] and then you can remember those five
[00:19:16] letters have a final form none of the
[00:19:18] others do all right so that's all of
[00:19:20] them you've learned 22 Hebrew characters
[00:19:23] actually a little bit more because there
[00:19:24] were some final forms and some with the
[00:19:26] D gash and all that now just to test you
[00:19:28] a little bit see if you can read the
[00:19:29] following words now you may not know
[00:19:31] what they mean but at least you can
[00:19:33] sound them out and they may make
[00:19:35] [Music]
[00:19:37] sense so this first one is Tel
[00:19:41] [Music]
[00:19:42] Aviv this word is Hanukah and this one I
[00:19:46] don't even know if it's correct but if
[00:19:47] it is cool but if you sound it out you
[00:19:49] should get my name
[00:19:51] Nelson all right what did you think
[00:19:54] about learning those letters in Hebrew
[00:19:57] yes yes yes it's approved which was your
[00:19:59] favorite one B like this
[00:20:03] one and what was the name of it
[00:20:06] B very good you know why you know what
[00:20:09] was the first one called Alf so when you
[00:20:11] put them together Alf and bet makes
[00:20:17] alphabet really yes all right well thank
[00:20:21] you guys for watching I hope that helped
[00:20:22] you learn a little bit of the Hebrew
[00:20:24] script I've always looked at it and
[00:20:26] thought it was a very fascinating
[00:20:28] interesting looking character set
[00:20:29] probably the oldest character set uh
[00:20:31] that's probably still used today
[00:20:33] definitely the oldest alphabet still
[00:20:35] used today that's mind-blowing right
[00:20:38] yeah uh any Last Words My friend Shalom
[00:20:41] pom bom all right please like And
[00:20:43] subscribe please check out the links in

[00:20:50] some of the families that are going
[00:20:51] through some hard times right now this
[00:20:52] world is a scary place and hopefully

=== My Story // Memory Games Documentary (2018) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s45Nzg5AZgQ

[00:00:05] [Music]
[00:00:11] [Music]
[00:00:15] my first memory I was 3 years old I
[00:00:19] remember seeing the older kids learning
[00:00:22] how to read um but we weren't going to
[00:00:24] read in our class but I went home that
[00:00:26] day and told my mom that I wanted to
[00:00:27] read or learn how to read and and uh she
[00:00:30] came and talked to the teacher and by
[00:00:32] the end of that year I was still three
[00:00:35] um I was learning how to read it was a
[00:00:37] book called The Village with three
[00:00:44] corners so growing up I played a lot of
[00:00:47] basketball being tall I was often kind
[00:00:49] of shoved into that sport but I I wasn't
[00:00:52] that good I was a skinny lanky guy so
[00:00:55] I'd always get pushed around and yelled
[00:00:57] up by my coach cuz I was a big guy but I
[00:00:59] didn't play like one one eventually I I
[00:01:02] found CrossFit it's competitive it's
[00:01:06] hardcore It's Made Me Stronger than I've
[00:01:08] ever been and I do it nearly every
[00:01:10] single
[00:01:12] [Applause]
[00:01:18] day I'd always been interested in things
[00:01:21] with the Mind things that were kind of
[00:01:23] beyond what people think your brain is
[00:01:25] capable of that's always kind of been
[00:01:27] there and when I studied um physics and
[00:01:30] Mathematics that's when I got my degree
[00:01:32] in a lot of our teachers our professors
[00:01:35] could do some really impressive on
[00:01:37] the-fly calculations and I always
[00:01:38] admired that and thought to myself
[00:01:40] that's a really cool skill to have and
[00:01:42] but memory never really became a huge
[00:01:45] interest of mine until my grandmother um
[00:01:48] started getting worse and worse um with
[00:01:52] Alzheimer's and um she lived abroad in
[00:01:54] France and so we'd get to see her maybe
[00:01:57] every 6 months two a year here so near
[00:02:01] the end the differences between when I
[00:02:04] would see had seen her last were huge
[00:02:06] and super shocking to
[00:02:21] me and when she finally passed that was
[00:02:23] kind of like this I can't believe that a
[00:02:26] a disease that kind of affects your
[00:02:28] memory eventually took her her body
[00:02:30] forgot how to function that's what
[00:02:33] really said okay I'm going to try and
[00:02:35] figure out what this memory world is
[00:02:37] really about and start using it and
[00:02:39] training myself to eventually not end up
[00:02:43] like her I started doing research and
[00:02:45] one of the first things I heard about
[00:02:46] was the memory Championship us memory
[00:02:48] championship and that seemed like a
[00:02:50] perfect Target for me to aim for you
[00:02:53] know there were specific disciplines
[00:02:55] with records and it was a measurable
[00:02:58] goal I'm going to improve my memory and
[00:03:00] I'm going to have to win that
[00:03:01] competition and break records cool let
[00:03:03] me do
[00:03:10] that so what I always like to say to all
[00:03:12] of you as we begin our day here this
[00:03:14] morning we're doing something
[00:03:16] extraordinary and something that's
[00:03:18] becoming more and more important and
[00:03:20] timely in our world today as brain
[00:03:23] health continues to become one of the
[00:03:25] hottests in the
[00:03:28] world
[00:03:50] [Applause]
[00:03:51] [Music]
[00:03:58] what's important about the journey is
[00:03:59] that it's it's something you know that
[00:04:01] it has associations to
[00:04:04] emotions it's a bunch of emotional cues
[00:04:07] kind of jumbled together funny stuff

[00:01:20] from there all right let's see then we
[00:01:22] got James the runner up from last year

[00:01:59] calmer than normal that is some
[00:02:02] confidence now that we have a lay of the
[00:02:04] land the competitor landscape let's
[00:02:07] check in with the host of the event Tony
[00:02:09] datino founder of the USA memory
[00:02:11] Championship we have people that have
[00:02:13] come through a qualifying events uh
[00:02:15] about two months ago and we have nine
[00:02:18] nine finalists that will be competing to
[00:02:20] see who's got the best memory in the
[00:02:22] United States and you were the one that
[00:02:23] handed me all five of my Trophies i the
[00:02:25] person that handed you all five of your
[00:02:27] trophies which is always an exciting
[00:02:29] thing and one of the things I always
[00:02:31] remember is one of our events in New
[00:02:33] York City when you glan out into the
[00:02:34] audience and missed a card which is
[00:02:37] speech we don't we don't talk about that
[00:02:39] here all right we W talk about that two
[00:02:41] of
[00:02:46] spades Nelson has made an error at card
[00:02:52] 33 yeah Tony thanks if you don't know
[00:02:55] what the competition is it's why I'm
[00:02:56] here speaking to you I've won the dang
[00:02:58] thing five times this is the trophy this
[00:03:01] is the most recent one it's a chunky one
[00:03:04] I have many of these seahorses um which
[00:03:07] they named Simon this year uh I think
[00:03:10] after simones who is where the Memory
[00:03:13] Palace technique is credited to from
[00:03:17] with although I don't think it's quite
[00:03:19] accurate anyways the competition is
[00:03:21] basically a bunch of people getting
[00:03:22] together to memorize a bunch random
[00:03:24] stuff and seeing who has the best memory
[00:03:27] I used to have the best memory I'm no
[00:03:28] longer in the mix so other people are
[00:03:30] coming up rising up from out of nowhere
[00:03:32] becoming the new best memorizers in the
[00:03:35] United States enough of the Preamble
[00:03:37] let's dive into the nitty-gritty what
[00:03:38] happened first first we started with the
[00:03:40] long-term event and that's what this
[00:03:41] event is it's a long-term event where 30
[00:03:44] days ago they were given a massive
[00:03:46] amount of information to memorize and
[00:03:48] now they're being tested on it thousands
[00:03:49] of bits of data now Emily unfortunately
[00:03:51] got in the first seat and she got her
[00:03:53] first one wrong did you not prepare um
[00:03:56] not that much H not good for her yet two
[00:03:59] two strikes here and then you're out so
[00:04:01] she was out real quick and then Ian got
[00:04:03] his second strike in the second round
[00:04:04] too unfortunately we have eliminated
[00:04:07] Emily and Ian so they eliminated two
[00:04:09] they were down to seven next was random
[00:04:11] words and holy crap did this go way up
[00:04:14] there usually it doesn't even go near
[00:04:16] 100 words but they got all the way up to
[00:04:18] 85 so Matt Wilson was the first to go on
[00:04:21] word 66 he said documentary but it was
[00:04:23] actually document that's tough then urum
[00:04:25] got his second one wrong on W 85 and
[00:04:27] that ended the round best we've ever
[00:04:30] done on this event then they were down
[00:04:32] to five competitors and next was the Tea
[00:04:34] Party event they adjusted the data again
[00:04:36] this year so there were six people
[00:04:37] instead of last year's five I work at
[00:04:40] the Goodwill as a cashier so I can best
[00:04:42] support my domestic long-hair cat you
[00:04:45] have to remember things like their name
[00:04:47] where they're from their zip code their
[00:04:48] Alma moer their favorite foods their car
[00:04:51] that they drive all that stuff it's all
[00:04:53] made up but James unfortunately
[00:04:55] got really bad seating here and he
[00:04:57] started off with the wrong name aser
[00:05:01] Parker Cruz that is not correct now for
[00:05:04] this event you get three strikes after a
[00:05:06] little while James got stuck on this
[00:05:08] answer of a Walmart stalker do you
[00:05:10] remember what she did Walmart stalker
[00:05:13] Walmart
[00:05:14] as a cashier Walmart shelf stock that
[00:05:19] isre the Shelf stalker is where we're
[00:05:21] missing up on her so James was out and
[00:05:23] then Sam got out three finalists were
[00:05:25] Jason Cameron Cameron who and John now
[00:05:28] this kid Cameron came out of nowhere and
[00:05:30] he was just killing it and he had this
[00:05:32] incredible line that he said how does it
[00:05:34] feel being like the middle of the Oreo
[00:05:35] cookie between two veterans I
[00:05:38] mean the cream is the best part of the
[00:05:41] Oreo that was smooth so the final event
[00:05:44] they have to memorize two dexs of cards
[00:05:46] in 5 minutes and we all know Jon can do
[00:05:48] this that's his specialty the other two
[00:05:50] guys I'm not too sure what they're
[00:05:51] capable of Cameron I had no idea but in
[00:05:53] the end it didn't really get too far
[00:05:54] Cameron made a mistake on the 14th card
[00:05:57] although I think he could have gone way
[00:05:58] further it's just that one card that
[00:06:00] tripped him up and then three cards
[00:06:01] later Jason stumbled seven of clubs that
[00:06:04] is not correct John congratulations
[00:06:08] you that's it 17 cards and you decided
[00:06:11] who the champion was but no matter John
[00:06:13] Graham the 2023 USA memory Champion
[00:06:15] Nelson you got anything you want to say
[00:06:17] about this he's got number three now
[00:06:18] you've got five stop competing please
[00:06:21] again I got to give another round of
[00:06:23] applause to John Graham Bravo my man
[00:06:27] third win third fraking win we have this
[00:06:30] kind of ongoing joke now it was more of
[00:06:32] a joke last year but now it's getting
[00:06:34] not so funny but basically as soon as he
[00:06:36] gets close to beating my record of five
[00:06:38] titles which is the most winningest uh
[00:06:41] amount of titles um in history of the
[00:06:43] competition I'm going to have to come
[00:06:45] back right because I can't let him take
[00:06:47] that record you understand that that's
[00:06:48] my record and he's got three so I can
[00:06:51] afford one more and then I have to come
[00:06:54] back right I can't even let him tie my
[00:06:56] record I don't want that to happen
[00:06:58] so I don't know I'm almost thinking
[00:07:01] maybe uh maybe next year I got to do
[00:07:03] something about it and uh uh deter him
[00:07:06] from from going for for more all right
[00:07:09] as is customary in past uh videos like
[00:07:12] this I usually take a portion of last
[00:07:14] year's video and I react to it it's
[00:07:16] usually me reacting to a video where I
[00:07:19] was reacting but now we're so deep down
[00:07:21] the Inception rabbit hole that I think
[00:07:23] that this technically will be me
[00:07:25] reacting to me reacting to me reacting
[00:07:28] to me reacting to me reacting I think
[00:07:31] that's right does that check out
[00:07:33] honestly I'm really reacting to last
[00:07:34] year's video but my other reactions
[00:07:36] happen to be nested within that
[00:07:40] video I wonder how many years I'm going
[00:07:42] to do this because eventually I'm going
[00:07:43] to have a reaction to reaction to a
[00:07:45] reaction to a reaction to
[00:07:48] reaction to Infinity that'll be pretty
[00:07:51] cool anyways all right here we go oh
[00:07:53] let's not forget mind lab Pro this is
[00:07:56] the company that I always support they
[00:07:59] make this amazing brain supplement that

[00:08:11] memory techniques my my training

[00:08:23] healthy Round of Applause my man
[00:08:25] literally said the same thing just now
[00:08:27] now he joins the two-time champion Club
[00:08:29] so we got we got John Graham we got uh
[00:08:32] RAM Coley we got Ron White we got me we
[00:08:35] got Scott hagwood and we got ta Tatiana
[00:08:40] Kuli I think so there's six so I think
[00:08:43] yeah now he's up above the double
[00:08:44] winners he's in the triple winners um
[00:08:46] and I think that sole other person is um
[00:08:51] Tatiana kulie who was the first winner
[00:08:52] ever she won the first three
[00:08:54] competitions I think Scott W hagwood has
[00:08:56] four and then I have five so he's in
[00:08:58] Good Company I won the
[00:09:00] 2021 USA memory
[00:09:04] Championship my fifth title my fifth
[00:09:07] title my fifth title you know looking
[00:09:09] back at that that was 2 years
[00:09:11] ago first of all I was in a different
[00:09:13] house here I'm in a different house here
[00:09:15] in a different house it's kind of crazy
[00:09:16] to see the journey and my hair my
[00:09:18] hairstyles right I had the spiky I had
[00:09:20] the comb hair now I have Comb hair too I
[00:09:23] don't know my agent okay I feel like
[00:09:26] last year looks good last year before
[00:09:28] that looks bad but that was like kind of
[00:09:29] getting out of coid times but anyways
[00:09:31] man I still remember winning that
[00:09:33] championship and how meaningful it was
[00:09:35] to me at the time that feeling has not
[00:09:37] gone away yet this is the trophy for the
[00:09:40] championship no it is not a bong and yes
[00:09:43] it is a seahorse why is it a seahorse
[00:09:45] well because the hippoc and yes they did
[00:09:48] have another seahorse this year and yes
[00:09:50] they did have another seahorse this year
[00:09:52] I lost again again and I lost again and
[00:09:56] again now I can say I won again again
[00:09:59] again again again again and now I can
[00:10:01] say I didn't either same thing here I
[00:10:06] did not win I did not lose I just did
[00:10:08] the same damn thing and it feels kind of
[00:10:11] nice but also kind of feels like I'm
[00:10:13] really missing out I got the the fomo
[00:10:15] building nice nice nice and I won this
[00:10:19] time mind you with kids which you can
[00:10:21] hear crying in the yard and now I have
[00:10:24] even more kids and now I have even more
[00:10:28] kids
[00:10:30] wait no no I had I had the same amount
[00:10:32] of kids here I I forget how many
[00:10:35] I have maybe this is my age and and you
[00:10:37] know just my skills
[00:10:39] declining it looked like here I didn't
[00:10:41] have both decks down cold I definitely
[00:10:43] didn't have both decks down cold here
[00:10:45] either but just goes to show you anybody
[00:10:48] who's interested in trying to win the
[00:10:49] USA championship you don't have to be
[00:10:52] perfect okay this is interesting because
[00:10:54] I've actually trained cards probably
[00:10:56] more than I did this year a little point
[00:10:59] on uh the cards finals this year it went
[00:11:02] to like 17 cards or something like that
[00:11:05] and JN won now JN had both decks for
[00:11:07] sure but it just goes to show you that
[00:11:09] like sometimes you don't actually need
[00:11:10] to know many cards some people make
[00:11:12] mistakes granted you would have been up
[00:11:14] against John all the way to the end and
[00:11:16] that might have been tough but you know
[00:11:19] in theory if he makes messes up then you
[00:11:21] could win without having ever having to
[00:11:23] memorize the full deck It's Tricky like
[00:11:25] that and what was encouraging is that
[00:11:27] Cameron who came in second has so much
[00:11:29] potential he reminds me a lot of Alex
[00:11:33] Mullen mixed with a little spiciness of
[00:11:36] me and I think if he and he's going to
[00:11:38] school soon sometimes that's where
[00:11:40] potential people who could win kind of
[00:11:43] lose their strep because they're busy
[00:11:44] with school but I feel like if he sticks
[00:11:45] to it he could he could come back and
[00:11:47] and challenge John pretty strongly maybe
[00:11:51] it's cuz I didn't have to compete um but
[00:11:52] I definitely felt like I would have put
[00:11:54] up a good fight against JN had I been
[00:11:56] there I wish I had now with regards to
[00:11:58] that I have not trained very much in the
[00:12:00] last year I've worked on very specific
[00:12:02] memory projects some for my YouTube
[00:12:04] videos some for other things um but
[00:12:06] cards while I still do them for
[00:12:09] demonstrations are not at my Peak right
[00:12:11] now and uh I definitely would not have
[00:12:13] been ready if I had been thrown on stage
[00:12:16] um but the nice thing about that is it's
[00:12:18] very easy to get it back so not worried
[00:12:21] about that that might have been my last
[00:12:23] USA memory
[00:12:25] competition again I'm going to react to
[00:12:27] that that's funny because that little
[00:12:29] video in the bottom corner when did I
[00:12:31] shoot that that was in uh 2018 right and
[00:12:35] I was saying that was my last
[00:12:36] championship but so that little one is
[00:12:38] 2018 then the one outside of that 2019
[00:12:41] then the one outside of that was 2021
[00:12:44] cuz there was no competition in 2020 and
[00:12:46] this last one was 2022 and this one is
[00:12:49] 2023 the biggest Nelson here who was
[00:12:53] uncertain if he really was going to not
[00:12:55] compete this year was
[00:12:57] correct here here we go
[00:13:00] but I don't know if he was fully correct
[00:13:05] John is threatening me to come out of
[00:13:07] retirement and I feel this
[00:13:10] pull much less than I did here I had a
[00:13:13] twinkle in my my thoughts but now it's
[00:13:17] like uh I can almost see it right and uh
[00:13:23] yeah let's keep going 10 years later
[00:13:25] from my first win and you know here I am
[00:13:29] I I I won again and 2009 was my first
[00:13:32] competition so 2013 8 years later I'm
[00:13:35] still here although I think this is it I
[00:13:37] I really do I say that now but I really
[00:13:40] believe five is was the number I was
[00:13:42] looking for I got it I don't know five
[00:13:45] still feels really good you know what
[00:13:47] five does not feel that good anymore you
[00:13:49] know I can put it on one
[00:13:51] hand but man can you imagine having to
[00:13:54] use two hands it's it's so funny the
[00:13:57] perspectives right like I feel very like
[00:14:00] sure in all of these videos here but in
[00:14:04] a year you know I I I knew this would
[00:14:07] happen I would change and feel like
[00:14:10] maybe one more right but the thing that
[00:14:12] terrifies me still is if I go and
[00:14:14] compete and I lose right what do I do
[00:14:16] with that do I go slink back to the
[00:14:19] Shadows never to compete again just got
[00:14:21] my hands swapped yeah you can't compete
[00:14:25] anymore or then do I just have to keep
[00:14:26] competing until I win another one right
[00:14:29] and then it's just like why did I even I
[00:14:32] should have just stayed as a winner
[00:14:34] right that's that's that was the image
[00:14:35] but I don't really have a need to add a
[00:14:38] six in front of it it almost feels a bit
[00:14:40] stupid and unnecessary so five still
[00:14:42] feels good I'm happy about that else to
[00:14:45] prove it's changed I know I told John
[00:14:48] that I'd like to compete against him in
[00:14:50] the finals but it's true I still would I
[00:14:53] I said I would have loved to have been
[00:14:54] there in the finals with him and I
[00:14:56] honestly feel like as he wins more it's
[00:14:59] just really it's it feels like it's
[00:15:01] converging man like it's he's going to
[00:15:04] win another one next year and then I
[00:15:05] have to come back in
[00:15:07] 2025 and it's going to end up being a
[00:15:09] finals a buildup of years that we've
[00:15:12] never met in the finals and it'll just
[00:15:15] be him and I in the cards and it'll be
[00:15:17] like everything that the sport has like
[00:15:19] culminated to or something like that I'm
[00:15:21] I'm exaggerating cuz potentially there
[00:15:22] could be other things that happen other
[00:15:24] people who come in the mix but in an
[00:15:26] ideal world that would be an awesome
[00:15:28] Sports story right the five-time champ
[00:15:31] who's retired suddenly has to get pulled
[00:15:33] back in because this four-time Champion
[00:15:35] is threatening F five time champion and
[00:15:38] uh they're in the finals the battle
[00:15:40] maybe we both get through all two decks
[00:15:42] of cards and then there's like the
[00:15:44] sudden death which has never happened
[00:15:46] before could be crazy I win of course in
[00:15:49] that scenario you know there's also
[00:15:51] something really nice about having hung
[00:15:52] up my cleats on a win you just got to
[00:15:55] persevere and stick to the goddamn thing
[00:15:57] you want to get done
[00:15:59] done God damn it God damn it God damn it
[00:16:02] I think back on it and you know from
[00:16:04] that perspective now it still feels like
[00:16:07] I'm So Satisfied by it very proud of
[00:16:09] myself back then um that's not going to
[00:16:12] change it has not changed I feel very
[00:16:14] proud of that moment that year
[00:16:16] everything that was going on yeah that
[00:16:19] was a good that was a good comeback
[00:16:21] story for myself and even when I think
[00:16:23] about competing again I kind of stop
[00:16:25] myself because I'm like no you had the
[00:16:27] best way to close it out that that
[00:16:31] feeling if you you you'll never really
[00:16:34] get that again you know maybe I don't
[00:16:36] even think if I win again I'd get that
[00:16:37] again and if I lose I definitely won't
[00:16:40] get that again and it'll sour that
[00:16:42] feeling that I had that memory of that
[00:16:44] feeling but on the flip side I
[00:16:46] definitely felt
[00:16:49] like man I miss this feeling I miss this
[00:16:53] feeling I want that feeling
[00:16:55] again and obviously I can only get that
[00:16:57] from winning
[00:16:59] right that's not true I can get it
[00:17:00] elsewhere I just need to find another
[00:17:02] place to find it but I yeah I can feel
[00:17:05] his his conviction into what he's saying
[00:17:07] here um and it's mostly there I
[00:17:10] appreciate what he's saying and it's
[00:17:11] true I'm still kind of on board with him
[00:17:13] but thoughts are creeping in that's all
[00:17:15] I'm saying all right that's good uh nice
[00:17:18] little throwback to my old videos I love
[00:17:21] going back and watching happy Nelson

=== how to CRUSH the SIMON memory game! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4fQC9dTJdw

[00:00:00] you know what's annoying this freaking
[00:00:02] thing but it doesn't have to be that way
[00:00:04] I'm gonna teach you an easy memory trick
[00:00:05] that'll help you absolutely crush this
[00:00:07] game and with a bit of practice actually
[00:00:09] beat the whole damn thing
[00:00:12] for those of you that live under a rock
[00:00:15] the game Simon's very simple it presents
[00:00:17] you a sequence of colors and you just
[00:00:19] have to repeat them back they get
[00:00:20] increasingly hard by one more color
[00:00:22] every round until you can't remember the
[00:00:24] sequence and you mess up
[00:00:27] the point of the game is to get as far
[00:00:29] as you possibly can okay most people
[00:00:31] that ever try this probably can't get
[00:00:33] very far maybe seven maybe ten if you
[00:00:36] get an easy sequence and past that it's
[00:00:38] pretty hard for the average person you
[00:00:40] you watch your my channel you're not the
[00:00:42] average person anyways let's dive in and
[00:00:44] get started
[00:00:46] it's really simple there are four colors
[00:00:48] red green blue and yellow now when you
[00:00:50] try to do it by rote repetition you're
[00:00:53] just trying to remember a pattern and
[00:00:54] that works up to a point and if you have
[00:00:56] a forgiving sequence something that's
[00:00:58] easy to remember maybe a lot of repeats
[00:00:59] maybe a
[00:01:00] pattern that makes sense to you it might
[00:01:02] be an easier one to memorize a longer
[00:01:04] sequence of but it's not reliable and we
[00:01:06] need a system memory techniques are all
[00:01:08] about coming up with a system that help
[00:01:10] you chunk information into smaller bites
[00:01:12] what I mean by that instead of trying to
[00:01:14] remember the colors in order why don't
[00:01:16] we come up with pictures that represent
[00:01:18] groups of sequences of colors and
[00:01:21] remember that instead
[00:01:23] I'll show you what I mean all right so
[00:01:24] the trick is this so let's just give all
[00:01:26] these colors a simple sound or letter to
[00:01:29] associate with it so green will be g red
[00:01:31] will be R blue will be B and yellow will
[00:01:34] be L because of the Double L all right
[00:01:36] so what do you do with those letters
[00:01:37] well every time there's a new color in
[00:01:39] the sequence you translate it to a
[00:01:41] letter and then when there are two you
[00:01:44] create a word now all those letters that
[00:01:46] I chose for you are all consonants so
[00:01:47] what you can do is put vowels in and
[00:01:49] around to make an actual word so let's
[00:01:52] say I got R and G those are the first
[00:01:55] two of my sequence then I'm just going
[00:01:56] to think of the word rag or rig either
[00:01:59] one and you picture the thing so picture
[00:02:01] a rag or picture a rig then the next two
[00:02:04] colors will come and you create another
[00:02:06] word and what you'll do is usually you
[00:02:09] can actually get pretty far with just
[00:02:10] kind of remembering the word since it
[00:02:12] repeats every round so you get a review
[00:02:13] every single round before you add one
[00:02:16] more but what you can do is connect all
[00:02:18] of those weird words those one syllable
[00:02:21] long words and make a story out of it
[00:02:23] let's do an example all right let's slow
[00:02:26] it down this will be chill just kind of
[00:02:28] going through an example here where
[00:02:30] we're looking at what this randomly
[00:02:32] shows us and how I would convert it to
[00:02:34] letters then to words and then images in
[00:02:36] my mind so green starts it off that says
[00:02:38] to Simon let's go and it'll start to
[00:02:40] show me the first color in the sequence
[00:02:42] and we have green so in my mind I'm
[00:02:44] holding the letter G the G sound so now
[00:02:46] it repeats the sequence of green and
[00:02:48] shows a red so now I have an R added to
[00:02:50] my sequence g and an R now it's at this
[00:02:53] point because I'm doing pairs I create a
[00:02:55] word with G and R as consonants and I
[00:02:58] can fill in with vowels wherever I want
[00:02:59] so first thing that comes to mind is a
[00:03:02] gear so in my mind I'm just picturing
[00:03:04] actually picturing the gear okay so now
[00:03:07] we keep going so now we have green red
[00:03:09] red right so I have the first two
[00:03:11] covered gear and now I have another R
[00:03:13] okay I can't do much with that until I
[00:03:15] get the next letter in the sequence
[00:03:18] so now I add this blue so I have gear
[00:03:20] then that R and now a new letter B so R
[00:03:24] and B I need to come up with something
[00:03:25] now you could think of R and B actually
[00:03:28] or you could think of like rub or robe
[00:03:32] or Ruby even but let's go with robe now
[00:03:35] my sequence is gear and robe and what
[00:03:37] I'll do is I'm going to make a story so
[00:03:39] I first start with the picture of a gear
[00:03:41] it's chugging along
[00:03:43] rotating churning whatever and it puts
[00:03:46] on a velvet Road really sexy sensual
[00:03:49] velvet Rogue and that's my story so far
[00:03:52] okay so now we have another letter to
[00:03:54] our sequence we have gear robe and
[00:03:56] another R okay I'm going to recite that
[00:03:57] and then wait for the next letter here
[00:03:59] we go
[00:04:02] and it goes back to the blue so I have
[00:04:04] gear robe and then actually another RB
[00:04:07] so I can think of another robe maybe
[00:04:10] there's two robes involved
[00:04:12] um or I could switch it up I could do
[00:04:13] rub right so maybe this gear puts on a
[00:04:16] robe and starts to give a very sensual
[00:04:18] rub down to other gears I don't know
[00:04:20] let's do one more pair
[00:04:23] okay so back to a g
[00:04:28] foreign
[00:04:32] [Music]
[00:04:33] is Gina G so you know we could play on
[00:04:37] this theme Here of kind of getting
[00:04:38] sensual here but maybe there's a gag
[00:04:40] involved all right so what's our
[00:04:43] sequence we have gear we have robe we
[00:04:45] have rub we have gag right and now just
[00:04:48] that weird image you know you may even
[00:04:50] think like okay that's a lot of words
[00:04:51] Nelson how am I going to remember more
[00:04:53] but it's not about the words it's about
[00:04:55] the story and the pictures forget about
[00:04:56] the words if you can think of the
[00:04:58] pictures and the story and make it vivid
[00:05:00] enough then you're gonna remember it so
[00:05:02] I have a gear wearing the robe doing a
[00:05:05] sensual rub and applying a gag
[00:05:08] to another gear or something like that
[00:05:09] and suddenly there you've memorized
[00:05:11] eight letters in order and all you got
[00:05:14] to do right when you're converting this
[00:05:15] back to the buttons here is just say hey
[00:05:17] what consonants do I hear in these
[00:05:19] images so gear I hear g r so green red
[00:05:23] robe red blue rub red blue gag green
[00:05:28] green there you have it now one thing I
[00:05:31] gotta address because I know there are
[00:05:32] people out there saying like Nelson
[00:05:33] listen I played this game with no
[00:05:35] techniques and I got to level X or Y and
[00:05:39] all I did was just remember it and
[00:05:41] remember the pattern and the music and
[00:05:43] whatever sure there are definitely going
[00:05:44] to be sequences that are easier to
[00:05:45] memorize just by luck on the draw but
[00:05:47] what this system does is for any given
[00:05:50] sequence no matter how long you can
[00:05:53] always apply this system and get a
[00:05:56] really good result it's reliable every
[00:05:58] single time not just when you have a
[00:06:01] good sequence that's easy and that's
[00:06:02] where we're after we're after a system
[00:06:03] that can always be reliable oh one more
[00:06:06] thing if you have a number system you
[00:06:07] can actually instead of making these
[00:06:09] letters you can make each one of these
[00:06:10] one two three and four
[00:06:12] and then you're just memorizing a
[00:06:14] sequence of numbers that for me is
[00:06:15] actually the easiest way because
[00:06:16] memorizing numbers is easy but if you
[00:06:19] don't have the number system set up then
[00:06:20] the letter system is probably the way to
[00:06:22] go
[00:06:22] so that's it that is honestly it you can
[00:06:25] have fun with that you can go as far as
[00:06:27] you want the more you practice the
[00:06:28] easier it'll get some of these Simon
[00:06:30] games they fire the sequence at you
[00:06:32] pretty quick but if you find other
[00:06:34] versions of it sometimes a little slower
[00:06:35] a little more forgiving and you can
[00:06:37] practice it a little slower what you can
[00:06:39] do to even enhance it even further is
[00:06:41] Place those images in a Memory Palace I
[00:06:44] have tons of videos I'll link here
[00:06:45] somewhere you can use a memory pass I've
[00:06:47] talked about it in tons of other videos
[00:06:49] and it's a great way to store a lot of
[00:06:51] information I don't know what these max
[00:06:53] out to I'm probably going to try and see
[00:06:55] what the highest score you can get is I
[00:06:57] believe it's probably like 99 I would
[00:06:59] assume
[00:07:00] um but who knows let's see how far I can
[00:07:03] get
[00:07:08] [Applause]
[00:07:09] [Music]
[00:07:20] [Music]
[00:07:27] thank you

[00:08:03] [Music]
[00:08:07] so that's it if you're ever at a dinner
[00:08:10] party and somebody busts out one of
[00:08:12] these you can say excuse me pass it over
[00:08:15] here and you could spend the next 15 to
[00:08:19] 30 minutes just racking up insane points
[00:08:22] and looking like a genius you're
[00:08:25] welcome
[00:08:26] [Music]
[00:08:29] all right

=== Memorable Pie (a short film featuring @answerinprogress) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB84hdysF_M

[00:00:02] [Music]
[00:00:04] you know most people think having a good
[00:00:06] memory is an innate gift you're either
[00:00:08] born with it or you're not that is wrong
[00:00:11] flat out wrong having a good memory is
[00:00:15] just like baking a pie all the
[00:00:17] ingredients are there you just need to
[00:00:19] know what to do with them a few months
[00:00:20] ago I connected with Sabrina Cruz from
[00:00:22] the answer in progress Channel without
[00:00:24] training her memory hi there I'm Sabrina
[00:00:26] Cruz I'm a YouTuber at answer in
[00:00:28] progress and I used to be really
[00:00:30] insecure about my memory with
[00:00:31] trepidation she told me she wanted to
[00:00:34] memorize 3141 digits of pi I told her
[00:00:37] that was easy and she nervously laughed
[00:00:39] I'm gonna cut I need to drink water
[00:00:42] got some
[00:00:44] I told her with a few basic components
[00:00:46] she'd be able to improve her memory
[00:00:47] train her memory to a point where she
[00:00:50] could memorize all of those digits and
[00:00:52] perform them perfectly I'm
[00:01:01] Google to confirm that the first four
[00:01:03] digits was three one four one so that's
[00:01:06] my starting point
[00:01:07] these are the ingredients that I told
[00:01:09] her she'd need to make her pie a reality
[00:01:12] see what I did there man that was a long
[00:01:14] setup
[00:01:15] [Music]
[00:01:18] first you got to lay down that crust and
[00:01:21] what that crust represents is your
[00:01:23] intention the intent the importance that
[00:01:26] you place on this memory task that
[00:01:29] you're trying to achieve without that
[00:01:31] you're getting nowhere you have no pie
[00:01:33] so when Sabrina kept coming back to me
[00:01:35] saying oh I want to do this I want to do
[00:01:37] this yeah she kept putting it off I knew
[00:01:39] my head she wasn't going to be able to
[00:01:41] do it until she finally said hey I'm
[00:01:43] going to do a 30 day challenge and by
[00:01:45] the end of 30 days I'm gonna have all 3
[00:01:47] 000 whatever digits of pi and that's how
[00:01:49] she managed her goal sounds cool to want
[00:01:51] to memorize this and that and have all
[00:01:53] these big plans if you don't have the
[00:01:55] real real motivation to do so the real
[00:01:59] why you're getting nowhere
[00:02:03] foreign
[00:02:05] you got to fill that pie with the actual
[00:02:08] stuff that makes up the pie in this case
[00:02:11] the majority of it most of it is
[00:02:13] blueberries because it's a blueberry pie
[00:02:14] the basic components are the blueberries
[00:02:16] then you got the sugars to kind of Make
[00:02:18] It Sweet then you got the cornstarch so
[00:02:20] it doesn't get all soupy and then you
[00:02:22] have a little bit of the lemon juice to
[00:02:24] make it have a little bit of that Zang
[00:02:25] so think of the blueberries as your
[00:02:28] system what's the way you're going to
[00:02:29] encode that into something you can
[00:02:30] visualize because that's the first step
[00:02:31] you got to picture the stuff that you're
[00:02:33] trying to memorize in the case of
[00:02:35] Sabrina she had to come up with her Pao
[00:02:37] system person action object where she
[00:02:39] turns all her numbers into silly bizarre
[00:02:42] pictures such as giant hot dog man
[00:02:45] looking very proud holding up a bag full
[00:02:49] of hard-boiled eggs yeah they're wild
[00:02:52] then think of the sugar as how she gonna
[00:02:54] store it so in this case you use the
[00:02:56] Memory Palace to store all those
[00:02:58] thousands of digits that was the only
[00:02:59] way she was ever going to get them in
[00:03:00] order and she had to plan that using
[00:03:03] this storage system we're you're going
[00:03:05] to place those images that she created
[00:03:06] then you got the lemon juice and the
[00:03:08] cornstarch those are kind of like the
[00:03:09] little extra additives to make the stuff
[00:03:11] that you're memorizing more memorable
[00:03:13] [Music]
[00:03:16] then you gotta assemble the pie now this
[00:03:18] is when you put all of that together
[00:03:19] what is the plan because memorizing a
[00:03:21] few hundred digits okay you could
[00:03:23] probably do that in one sitting but
[00:03:25] 3141 that takes a plan how many memory
[00:03:28] policies do you need how many you're
[00:03:30] going to learn over this period of time
[00:03:31] it's not as straightforward as just
[00:03:33] building a big Memory Palace you can but
[00:03:35] it's challenging so I told Sabrina she
[00:03:37] should break it up into memory palaces
[00:03:39] of 50 locations each there's about 300
[00:03:42] images per set let's say she roughly
[00:03:45] does about 10 or 11. she's got the 3
[00:03:48] 000. so memorizing anything especially
[00:03:49] if it's a big project you got to have a
[00:03:51] plan how are you going to apply that
[00:03:53] intention how you're going to apply that
[00:03:55] system to memorize the thing that you're
[00:03:56] trying to memorize
[00:03:57] [Music]
[00:04:00] can you still see me yeah the last step
[00:04:02] I guess this is pretty important uh is
[00:04:05] baking you got to put the pie in the
[00:04:06] oven Let It Bake let it sit there let it
[00:04:09] cook for that certain amount of time and
[00:04:11] this is akin to review this is where you
[00:04:13] know the stuff but you really gotta bake
[00:04:15] it into your mind and that takes time
[00:04:16] you can't rush a bake right there's a
[00:04:19] certain amount of time you got to put in
[00:04:20] the oven and let it sit there so you
[00:04:22] gotta review especially if it's a big
[00:04:24] project you got to have a plan on how
[00:04:25] you're going to review as well I told
[00:04:27] Sabrina to do it in chunks of 300 she'd
[00:04:29] review I basically told her to review
[00:04:31] whenever she had a chance whether she
[00:04:32] was in a gym rock climbing driving
[00:04:35] laying in bed at night those are the
[00:04:37] places that you got to review whenever
[00:04:38] you have a pocket of time you got a
[00:04:40] review review because that's going to
[00:04:41] ensure that you're building it into your
[00:04:43] your baking it oh yeah you're baking it
[00:04:46] into your long-term memory now I have
[00:04:48] the most useless party trick to be
[00:04:49] honest my friends think I'm weird now
[00:04:51] it's fine thank you I think the pie is
[00:04:54] done now we should go get it
[00:04:57] [Music]
[00:05:08] that my friends is how you make an
[00:05:11] amazing memory now if you want to learn
[00:05:12] more about Sabrina's attempt and whether
[00:05:14] she got all 3141 digits of pie at her
[00:05:18] grand expose check out her video link in
[00:05:21] the description or up here somewhere and
[00:05:23] if you want to know how I memorized 10
[00:05:25] 000 digits of pi check out the videos I
[00:05:27] have linked below and hey if you have a
[00:05:29] big memory project that you're up to
[00:05:30] feel free to ask me a question send me a
[00:05:33] note send me a message write a comment
[00:05:34] and I'd love to help you out thanks for
[00:05:36] watching now I'm gonna need some pie and
[00:05:38] here's some pie for you

=== MEMORIZE the CYRILLIC alphabet (in 10 minutes) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKO-jx5JKak

[00:00:00] this video is sponsored by mindlab Pro
[00:00:02] more about them in the middle of the
[00:00:03] video
[00:00:04] one of the things I hate the most is
[00:00:06] that I can't read Russian letters
[00:00:09] whether it be in a book a movie in the
[00:00:11] news whatever it really bugs me so I
[00:00:14] decided to learn it with my mnemonics
[00:00:16] and my memory skills surprisingly it
[00:00:18] wasn't too hard so I wanted to share
[00:00:19] that with you in a five minute video
[00:00:21] that will get you to be able to read the
[00:00:22] Cyrillic alphabet with ease
[00:00:25] let's get into it
[00:00:26] [Music]
[00:00:33] so there are 33 letters in total five
[00:00:36] are pronounced the same in English and
[00:00:37] look the same in English six are similar
[00:00:39] to Greek actually a lot are similar to
[00:00:41] Greek but there are six really easy ones
[00:00:42] that are based off of Greek that you'll
[00:00:44] easily recognize six of the letters are
[00:00:45] used in English but they're pronounced
[00:00:47] differently so they're false friends and
[00:00:48] then the leftovers are pure Russian we
[00:00:50] just gotta learn them but we can do that
[00:00:51] with mnemonics and this kind of alphabet
[00:00:53] is perfect to learn with mnemonics let's
[00:00:55] Dive Right In I promise you this video
[00:00:57] will be super short just to get this
[00:00:59] point across that mnemonics can be
[00:01:00] applied really quickly to something that
[00:01:02] seems quite difficult yes
[00:01:05] that's awesome all right first we're
[00:01:07] gonna deal with the ones that sound and
[00:01:09] look like English all you gotta remember
[00:01:10] for this is this weird word akbot or you
[00:01:14] could look at it as AK like an AK-47 and
[00:01:17] then emote and the only image I want you
[00:01:19] to imagine is taking an AK-47 which is a
[00:01:22] Soviet rifle throwing it in a moat
[00:01:25] just a little caveat here I do not speak
[00:01:27] Russian okay so I'm going to butcher
[00:01:30] some of these pronunciations and again
[00:01:31] this is not what this video is for this
[00:01:33] is only so that you can recognize and
[00:01:35] actually read words and letters that are
[00:01:38] in this script so I apologize in advance
[00:01:39] for my butchering of some of these
[00:01:41] pronunciations forgive me amen the first
[00:01:45] one the letter a is pronounced ah as in
[00:01:47] car the next one the letter K is that
[00:01:50] sound from carc it's that hard C Sound
[00:01:53] not too different from English so far m
[00:01:55] is a m sound like a mom o is an o sound
[00:01:59] like orange and then the t is a t sound
[00:02:02] like table so akmat there's our first
[00:02:05] five letters
[00:02:06] so these next ones you know these sounds
[00:02:09] but they may look a little different
[00:02:11] this first one is the sound ba as in
[00:02:13] beard and it kind of looks like a b got
[00:02:15] a little hook on the top but it still
[00:02:17] looks like a b so not much to do there
[00:02:18] looks like it'd be it is a b this next
[00:02:20] one looks like the capital letter B but
[00:02:22] it actually is the sound of the as in
[00:02:25] vase so no problem there let's just
[00:02:27] imagine that this is a very ornate vase
[00:02:29] every time you see this letter look at
[00:02:31] it like it's a vase so this one's super
[00:02:33] easy it looks like a gun and it makes
[00:02:35] the sound of a g it's got that g that's
[00:02:38] a good this next letter looks like an H
[00:02:40] but it's actually the n Sound and the
[00:02:42] way I remember this is you can imagine
[00:02:44] that all these little lines are network
[00:02:46] lines connecting to different computers
[00:02:48] so it's like the n Sound in network this
[00:02:51] letter looks like a three it's backwards
[00:02:52] e but if you think about the cursive way
[00:02:55] to draw or write a Z this is the z sound
[00:02:59] and it's actually based off the letter
[00:03:01] Zeta and the Greek alphabet we can also
[00:03:03] imagine that there's like a zipper line
[00:03:05] going through the middle here Z zipper
[00:03:09] then you have this weird backwards n
[00:03:12] inverted n looking thing and that's
[00:03:14] actually the sound e as in t or eel and
[00:03:18] I can just imagine that this is the
[00:03:20] shape of an eel this next letter looks
[00:03:21] exactly like the one before the e sound
[00:03:24] but it has this little curve on the top
[00:03:26] and the sound that this character makes
[00:03:28] it's yeah as in Yoda so imagine that
[00:03:31] there's baby Yoda floating Above This
[00:03:34] eel yes this next one is the D sound the
[00:03:38] way I like to remember this is it looks
[00:03:40] like a door yeah it has little legs at
[00:03:41] the end but imagine it's a door way
[00:03:44] right you open it up you can go right
[00:03:45] through the door this next letter is
[00:03:48] very familiar to a lot of people it's
[00:03:49] the letter Pi for the Greek alphabet but
[00:03:52] it is the sound the P sound and you can
[00:03:54] imagine that it just looks like a pair
[00:03:55] of pants P for the letter pants this
[00:03:58] next letter very similar has a little
[00:03:59] hook on one of the legs there and that's
[00:04:01] the sound that it makes the l l is in
[00:04:03] the leg so that's one looks like a c and
[00:04:05] it is a c but it makes the S sound which
[00:04:07] in our language sometimes it does but
[00:04:09] let's just imagine that it's the mouth
[00:04:10] of a snake next is also another very
[00:04:13] common Greek Alphabet letter which is
[00:04:15] Phi stands for the sound the F sound and
[00:04:19] you can imagine that this just looks
[00:04:20] like a fancy flower this next letter is
[00:04:23] an X or looks like an X but it's
[00:04:25] actually the sound the H sound imagine
[00:04:27] that you don't want to say hi to
[00:04:29] somebody you're gonna do this maybe like
[00:04:31] X them out of your life you do not say
[00:04:33] hi to these people hell no there's no
[00:04:35] next letter is actually a backwards
[00:04:37] looking e thing and that is the e sound
[00:04:40] it's an e sound like in chef and just so
[00:04:43] you remember this video is sponsored by
[00:04:45] mind lab Pro
[00:04:47] my go-to supplement I highly encourage
[00:04:49] you guys to check the product out it's a
[00:04:51] nootropic blend made using premium grade
[00:04:54] research backed ingredients ethically
[00:04:56] sourced with a clean label and it's
[00:04:58] designed to help you perform at your
[00:04:59] Peak all day every day what I love about
[00:05:01] this product is that it is
[00:05:03] scientifically proven to work by
[00:05:05] independent University Research and
[00:05:06] double-blind placebo-controlled human
[00:05:08] trials a lot of nootropics out there
[00:05:10] claim all sorts of things and then they
[00:05:11] don't have the research to back them and
[00:05:13] even if they do sometimes the research
[00:05:14] is a bit flaky not in this case you can
[00:05:17] give it a try and see for yourself now
[00:05:18] back to the video this next one looks
[00:05:20] like the letter P but it actually is a
[00:05:22] rolling R sound R basically so just
[00:05:25] imagine that this thing looks like a
[00:05:27] racket R for racket another familiar
[00:05:29] letter it's the why but this is an ooh
[00:05:31] sound like a short u sound so you can
[00:05:34] maybe imagine that the two parts of the
[00:05:37] Y there are like the antlers of a moose
[00:05:40] that ooh sound from the Moose
[00:05:43] all right we're almost there these next
[00:05:45] four letters are very similar in how
[00:05:46] they sound but this first one is as in
[00:05:50] like genre so it kind of looks like an X
[00:05:52] but it has an extra line through it but
[00:05:53] imagine that genre of x-rated films it
[00:05:56] has an extra line through because it's
[00:05:58] just super x-rated this next one is the
[00:06:00] CH sound and that looks like an upside
[00:06:03] down chair this is the sound sh as in
[00:06:05] shrimp I just imagine having that as My
[00:06:08] Little Fork to poke and get some shrimp
[00:06:10] this next one is tricky because it
[00:06:12] basically looks like the shrimp sound
[00:06:13] but it has a little tail and it's
[00:06:15] actually the sound if you were to say
[00:06:17] like goldfish chimney
[00:06:20] so actually let's maybe imagine that
[00:06:22] there's goldfish going through these
[00:06:24] three chimneys and coming out the bottom
[00:06:26] there
[00:06:26] so these next five letters are basically
[00:06:29] combining two English sounds to get
[00:06:31] another sound so this e looks like an e
[00:06:34] it's kind of like an e but it's got a ye
[00:06:36] sound as in yeah let's just make this
[00:06:38] somebody's mouth as if somebody's saying
[00:06:41] the next is the same letter but with two
[00:06:43] dots on top it makes the sound that you
[00:06:45] might say if you were to say your the yo
[00:06:47] yo as in yolk so maybe you can imagine
[00:06:49] those two little dots are two egg yolks
[00:06:52] I like this next one a lot it looks as
[00:06:53] if you're gonna write i o u and it
[00:06:57] actually makes the sound you so just
[00:06:58] think of an IOU that's as good as money
[00:07:01] sir those are ious this backward R is
[00:07:03] super tricky because you think it might
[00:07:05] sound like an R but it actually is the
[00:07:07] ya sound as in yacht whereas Howard Dean
[00:07:09] once famously said this letter looks
[00:07:12] like a u but it has a little tail and
[00:07:14] this is actually the tennis sound
[00:07:16] together it's as in SAR I might imagine
[00:07:19] this as like a little hat for its SAR
[00:07:22] all right there's three more letters and
[00:07:24] two of them aren't even really letters
[00:07:25] let's start with those they're basically
[00:07:27] used to make other letters sound
[00:07:28] slightly different so just know that
[00:07:31] they don't really mean nothing I'm not
[00:07:32] going to get into the specifics here
[00:07:33] because I don't really understand them
[00:07:34] and the last one and I do not know how
[00:07:36] to say this sound is what looks like a b
[00:07:39] and an L but it is pronounced like a
[00:07:41] grand front almost like
[00:07:44] I guess it can be pronounced kind of
[00:07:47] like if somebody would say they were ill
[00:07:49] like the first part of the letter looks
[00:07:51] like somebody who's got like a distended
[00:07:53] belly and the other letter is the nurse
[00:07:55] and it's gonna fix that person who's ill
[00:07:57] I get it are you saying pow all right
[00:08:00] that's it I guarantee if you were to
[00:08:01] look at some Cyrillic alphabet words in
[00:08:04] Russian or any Slavic speaking language
[00:08:08] although some of the other languages may
[00:08:10] have a few extra letters like Ukrainian
[00:08:12] montenegrin Serbia have a few other
[00:08:14] characters essentially you'll get the
[00:08:15] idea and before I go here are a few
[00:08:17] example words that you probably can read
[00:08:19] now and what they mean what do you think
[00:08:21] this first one is
[00:08:23] yeah it's actor about this one
[00:08:28] remember we're going for the Sounds here
[00:08:30] so this one actually pronounces to
[00:08:32] business what about this one
[00:08:35] it's garage and finally can you guess
[00:08:39] this one this is from my children's book
[00:08:41] translated into Russian what does this
[00:08:43] word say right there
[00:08:45] yeah my book this is my book I wrote
[00:08:48] this book but it was translated into
[00:08:49] Russian I can't read it I mean I can
[00:08:51] read my name but that's about it pretty
[00:08:53] cool right that wasn't hard anyways that
[00:08:55] was a quick little video just to teach
[00:08:57] you the Cyrillic alphabet and how to
[00:08:59] read it yeah that's all I gotta say it's
[00:09:01] pastiva I honestly I know no Russian at
[00:09:03] all but I do know how to read it now and
[00:09:04] so do you I'll see you later
[00:09:09] foreign

=== I asked CHATGPT 💻 for some RANDOM THINGS to MEMORIZE 🧠 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fFAl8x-wZY

[00:00:00] I asked chat GPT to challenge me with
[00:00:02] some things to memorize here's what it
[00:00:03] came up with the number of links it
[00:00:05] takes to get to the center of a Tootsie
[00:00:06] Pop 144 didn't know that but I just
[00:00:08] memorized it so now I do it capital of
[00:00:10] Burkina Faso ugudugu I already knew that
[00:00:12] the names of all the dwarves in Snow
[00:00:13] White doc grumpy happy sleepy bashful
[00:00:15] Sneezy Dopey got it the names of all the
[00:00:18] colors in the rainbow easy roygbiv the
[00:00:20] mathematical constant pi to 100 decimal
[00:00:22] places
[00:00:23] really I know ten thousand the names of
[00:00:26] all the bones in the body I don't know
[00:00:28] that but I should let's do it now as I'm
[00:00:30] memorizing I have a memory master class
[00:00:32] that teaches this stuff and registration
[00:00:33] is opening up soon check out the link in
[00:00:35] the description if you want to know how

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:05] hey guys how you doing
[00:00:07] [Music]
[00:00:08] um do you guys have maybe things with
[00:00:10] barcodes on them that I can memorize
[00:00:12] that's perfect yeah cards awesome let's
[00:00:17] start with the water bottle the average
[00:00:20] human can hold roughly seven bits of
[00:00:22] information in their memory at one time
[00:00:24] all right this guy is going to you'll
[00:00:27] learn 30 in less than 30 seconds
[00:00:31] all right
[00:00:35] [Music]
[00:00:36] all right
[00:00:38] so we'll start over here with the water
[00:00:41] bottle it was four nine zero two two
[00:00:45] five one seven four three
[00:00:49] the cards is seven three eight five four
[00:00:52] zero zero zero nine two
[00:00:55] [Applause]
[00:00:57] and then the the suntan lotion it's five
[00:01:01] four four zero two two five zero four
[00:01:06] eight
[00:01:08] awesome thank you guys
[00:01:11] this man is Nelson Dallas one of
[00:01:15] America's top mental athletes
[00:01:18] is he the best we're about to find out
[00:01:23] welcome to the 2013 USA memory
[00:01:27] championships
[00:01:30] eight-hour marathon of mind-bending
[00:01:32] mental gymnastics you might think it's
[00:01:34] just a bunch of nodes indeeds but this
[00:01:36] is a competition get ready to learn the
[00:01:39] tricks of the country's memory master
[00:01:40] Masters without this system did not
[00:01:43] memorize an 800 digit number but at the
[00:01:47] end of this competition only one brain
[00:01:50] will be left stand
[00:01:52] [Music]
[00:02:04] 8 A.M and 50 of the country's top mental
[00:02:07] athletes are arriving in New York City
[00:02:09] for the biggest competition in their
[00:02:11] sport I've been training hard for the
[00:02:13] last eight months over the past few
[00:02:14] weeks I've been cranking it up you know
[00:02:16] maybe six to ten hours a day big day
[00:02:19] we're all here to be King Of The Nerds
[00:02:22] this is the 16th annual USA memory
[00:02:26] Championship every year mental athletes
[00:02:28] square off over nine hours of grueling
[00:02:31] competition
[00:02:32] after four preliminary events the eight
[00:02:35] highest overall scores Advanced to the
[00:02:37] finals where they go head to head in
[00:02:40] three elimination rounds
[00:02:41] [Music]
[00:02:43] the last person standing is crowned U.S
[00:02:46] memory champion
[00:02:47] [Applause]
[00:02:51] the memory power in the room today is
[00:02:54] enormous with four Champs returning and
[00:02:57] a class of rising stars this is the most
[00:02:59] competitive field in USA memory history
[00:03:02] I think this is maybe the strongest
[00:03:04] competition ever we've got several new
[00:03:06] people who at least they talk big you
[00:03:08] know oh the young guys may talk the talk
[00:03:12] but two-time champ Ronnie White walks
[00:03:14] the walk
[00:03:17] Ronnie White is an amazing competitor
[00:03:20] and a great mind he's a character he's
[00:03:23] big loud Texas we'll be in the finals
[00:03:26] for sure last year I didn't train at all
[00:03:28] I just had a theory I'm just going to go
[00:03:30] in there have fun I put Doritos and
[00:03:33] gummy bears in my underwear and I came
[00:03:35] in second place now he's got his sight
[00:03:37] set on capturing another memory
[00:03:39] Championship I've held the records I've
[00:03:41] been the two-time USA memory Champion
[00:03:43] I've proven myself I'm a very
[00:03:46] competitive person I'm going to win
[00:03:49] the first preliminary event is about to
[00:03:51] begin
[00:03:53] they gave you a sheet with 117 names
[00:03:58] and after 15 minutes they give you the
[00:04:01] same faces back but in a different order
[00:04:04] and then you have to fill in the names
[00:04:06] with correct spelling a good score for
[00:04:09] these mental Titans is to recall 100 out
[00:04:12] of the possible 234 first and last names
[00:04:15] I think this might be my one of my
[00:04:17] strongest events this year so last year
[00:04:19] for Ninja face they did about 163 I
[00:04:22] think so I'd like to beat that I think I
[00:04:24] can if if I Pace myself right however
[00:04:27] the person to beat in this event is the
[00:04:29] strong man of memory
[00:04:32] Michael the tank glance who has given a
[00:04:35] whole new meaning to the term brain
[00:04:37] power in the event for names and faces I
[00:04:40] ended up with 175 names memorized which
[00:04:43] is a International Record you heard
[00:04:46] right last year he memorized
[00:04:49] 175 names in just 15 minutes the key to
[00:04:53] Michael's success a training regime that
[00:04:55] includes both physical and mental
[00:04:57] workouts with weight training and memory
[00:04:59] it's not something that you can just
[00:05:01] give up the brain is a muscle you got to
[00:05:03] keep working at it or else you're going
[00:05:04] to lose it
[00:05:06] during your lifetime your brain will
[00:05:08] shrink 10 to 15 percent but fear not
[00:05:11] studies show that physical and mental
[00:05:13] exercise can help reverse the effects of
[00:05:16] Aging by jump starting the process that
[00:05:18] creates new brain cells lifting there's
[00:05:20] only one thing on my mind and that
[00:05:22] translates over into memory where I just
[00:05:24] have that one thing to focus on nothing
[00:05:26] else matters at the moment I'm out for
[00:05:28] blood in this event
[00:05:33] [Music]
[00:05:35] and this is the moment Michael has been
[00:05:38] training months for
[00:05:39] medical athletes you may begin
[00:05:51] that specializes in it the fusiform face
[00:05:54] area but we're much better at noticing
[00:05:57] this than remembering them our brains
[00:05:59] even fool us to seed faces that do not
[00:06:02] exist check out the front of this car
[00:06:05] what do you see
[00:06:08] exactly that's your brain giving facial
[00:06:12] recognition priority over what you are
[00:06:14] actually seeing
[00:06:16] so how do mental athletes match 117
[00:06:19] faces to names by using a special memory
[00:06:22] technique and lots of practice to
[00:06:25] memorize names faces pick a feature on
[00:06:27] the face that stands out to you most
[00:06:28] accentuate that feature and then you're
[00:06:30] going to take the person's name linking
[00:06:33] that name to that feature
[00:06:37] this photo for example
[00:06:39] Jack's distinguishing characteristic is
[00:06:41] his colorful hair so when you look at
[00:06:43] him you might picture a rainbow then you
[00:06:46] can connect that to his name by
[00:06:48] picturing a baker holding a Jack of
[00:06:50] Hearts while sliding down a rainbow
[00:06:53] foreign
[00:06:55] try memorizing a few of the names using
[00:06:58] this Association technique
[00:07:04] [Music]
[00:07:10] [Music]
[00:07:22] time is up
[00:07:25] the papers and switch them with a blank
[00:07:29] just how many names can you remember
[00:07:36] [Music]
[00:07:44] [Music]
[00:07:48] foreign
[00:07:54] [Music]
[00:07:56] like I said it takes practice but don't
[00:07:59] give up because I bet you still remember
[00:08:01] this guy's name
[00:08:12] you can see
[00:08:15] the names were hard this year I mean
[00:08:18] there were no Smiths you know I think I
[00:08:20] did all right it's kind of a weird match
[00:08:22] this year there was a lot of weird
[00:08:23] spellings in the names only the top
[00:08:26] eight mental athletes Advanced to the
[00:08:28] championship rounds so these first
[00:08:30] scores are crucial
[00:08:32] [Applause]
[00:08:44] [Music]
[00:08:46] Nelson Dallas tops the leaderboard with
[00:08:49] an impressive 162 names were called
[00:08:52] Michael glantz finishes second but it's
[00:08:55] still early and former Champs Ronnie
[00:08:57] White and ROM Coley are within Striking
[00:08:59] Distance being
[00:09:01] on the leaderboard is nothing new to ROM
[00:09:03] Coley over the last decade this
[00:09:06] perennial Challenger has been to more
[00:09:08] finals than anyone
[00:09:10] I'm Ram Kohli I'm the 2005 U.S national
[00:09:13] memory Champion ROMs road to the memory
[00:09:15] Championship began 8 000 miles away in
[00:09:18] Hyderabad India where as a young boy he
[00:09:21] would memorize pages from books I
[00:09:23] started looking at a book and I said
[00:09:25] okay let me just memorize these four
[00:09:27] pages you know my parents were totally
[00:09:29] got off guys how I could do this while
[00:09:31] attending graduate school in the U.S he
[00:09:34] learned about the memory Championship
[00:09:35] just two years later in 2005 he captured
[00:09:39] the title but the last eight years have
[00:09:42] seen one disappointment after another as
[00:09:45] ROMs continually come up short in his
[00:09:47] bid for another championship it's been
[00:09:49] frustrating and that's been part of the
[00:09:51] motivation this year to go back and
[00:09:53] compete and try to win it all the second
[00:09:56] preliminary event is about to start
[00:10:01] competitors have just five minutes to
[00:10:04] memorize a computer-generated sequence
[00:10:06] of 500 randomized digits the clear
[00:10:09] favored in this event is the Michael
[00:10:11] Jordan of memory reigning champ Nelson
[00:10:14] Dallas
[00:10:17] is God among men
[00:10:20] Nelson Dallas he's at a different level
[00:10:22] at a different level a former B student
[00:10:26] Nelson was inspired to learn memory
[00:10:28] techniques because of the illness of a
[00:10:30] loved one the main reason I got
[00:10:32] interested in memory training was
[00:10:33] because my grandmother had Alzheimer's
[00:10:36] disease was inspired to really train my
[00:10:39] brain so that that wouldn't happen to me
[00:10:40] down the road at last year's
[00:10:42] championships Nelson set a U.S record by
[00:10:45] recalling 303 digits inward
[00:10:48] that's like memorizing 43 phone numbers
[00:10:51] in just five minutes how did he do it by
[00:10:55] mastering a centuries-old memorization
[00:10:56] technique known as Pao person action
[00:11:00] object person action object is a system
[00:11:04] where you take numbers that represent
[00:11:07] person action or an object and you
[00:11:09] combine them into
[00:11:10] one mental picture our brains are wired
[00:11:14] to recall visual images not numbers so
[00:11:16] by converting a string of digits to a
[00:11:19] vivid mental picture it makes it easier
[00:11:21] for our brain to remember them so I have
[00:11:23] a mental dictionary of a thousand people
[00:11:25] and from zero zero zero to 999 I've
[00:11:30] given each of those persons one of those
[00:11:33] digits I have an action associated with
[00:11:35] those guys as well as an object for
[00:11:37] example 34 is Shaquille O'Neal his
[00:11:39] action is dunking and his object is a
[00:11:43] backboard this system allows Nelson to
[00:11:45] convert strings of digits into easily
[00:11:47] memorable images by converting the first
[00:11:50] two digits into a person the next two
[00:11:52] into an action and
[00:11:54] to an object
[00:11:56] for example 48 66 31 48 is my dog when I
[00:12:03] look at the next two digits six six
[00:12:04] which the person is Satan but his action
[00:12:07] is setting fire into something and then
[00:12:09] the last two digits 31 which is a
[00:12:12] redneck Hillary guy playing the banjo
[00:12:14] but his object is a banjo so I throw
[00:12:17] that into the mix so I have
[00:12:19] 486631 it's a dog setting fire to a
[00:12:22] banjo one memorable image
[00:12:25] it took Nelson months to come up with
[00:12:28] this personal set of 3 000 people
[00:12:31] actions and objects this dedication to
[00:12:34] training could be the key to capturing
[00:12:36] another memory title
[00:12:42] remember the last week's where we all
[00:12:44] said ready
[00:12:46] you may begin
[00:12:48] just one misplaced digit could mean the
[00:12:51] difference between advancing to the
[00:12:53] finals or going home
[00:12:58] memory is a skill and you get better
[00:13:01] with practice
[00:13:02] so start now by memorizing this sentence
[00:13:05] [Music]
[00:13:09] let's see if you remember this after the
[00:13:11] break
[00:13:13] is this the sentence you saw before the
[00:13:16] break
[00:13:17] not exactly
[00:13:21] you can find games to challenge your
[00:13:23] brain at lumosity.com
[00:13:26] it's 10 a.m and America's top mental
[00:13:30] athletes are 90 minutes into the
[00:13:32] ultimate brain Marathon the USA memory
[00:13:35] championships defending champ Nelson
[00:13:38] Dulles has grabbed the early lead but
[00:13:40] this is still anyone's game time is up
[00:13:42] paper's over
[00:13:44] competitors just had five minutes to
[00:13:47] memorize a list of 500 computer
[00:13:50] generated numbers you have 10 minutes
[00:13:52] for recall you may begin
[00:13:57] [Music]
[00:13:58] your brain has more storage space than
[00:14:01] you could ever fill
[00:14:03] during your lifetime it will stockpile
[00:14:05] over one quadrillion pieces of
[00:14:08] information in your memory more than
[00:14:10] eighteen hundred times the amount of
[00:14:12] personal computer can hold
[00:14:14] time is up paper's over moderators
[00:14:18] please collect memorization sheets
[00:14:22] did you do better I think so I think I
[00:14:24] nailed it
[00:14:25] unless I misread something I think I
[00:14:28] scored 120 points unless I encoded
[00:14:31] something wrong because I definitely
[00:14:32] remembered all of my images saw
[00:14:34] everything crystal clear that time oh I
[00:14:37] know I did my first investment so I'm
[00:14:39] happy about it I think it does Place me
[00:14:40] into good running for a top eight
[00:14:43] the scores for Speed numbers are in and
[00:14:45] Nelson recalls 302 numbers more than
[00:14:49] twice as many as the nearest competitor
[00:14:51] and just one shy of his U.S record he
[00:14:54] now has a commanding lead in the overall
[00:14:56] competition Chief Rivals glance white
[00:14:59] and Coley are right behind him
[00:15:02] up next is the round that many claim is
[00:15:06] impossible to train for
[00:15:09] in the Poetry event we're given a
[00:15:11] previously unpublished poem that's 50
[00:15:15] lines and we have to memorize every part
[00:15:18] of it in 15 minutes your 15-minute time
[00:15:21] period begins now
[00:15:23] mental athletes must rely on good
[00:15:26] old-fashioned rote memorization in
[00:15:29] between words capitalizations and all
[00:15:31] punctuations there are 675 different
[00:15:34] characters to memorize in this poem time
[00:15:38] is left
[00:15:39] moderator please pick up the recall
[00:15:41] forms
[00:15:43] after the Poetry round the top of the
[00:15:45] leaderboard looks the same however
[00:15:47] former Champs ROM Coley and Ronnie White
[00:15:50] have dropped and now are in danger of
[00:15:52] falling out of the top eight
[00:15:54] well these Legends hold their spots in
[00:15:56] the top eight and Advance into the
[00:15:58] finals it's all in the cards
[00:16:04] the rules of the speed card event are
[00:16:06] they give you a shuffled deck of cards
[00:16:08] after five minutes they'll take away the
[00:16:10] deck and give you an unshuffled deck
[00:16:13] then you have to put that unshuffled
[00:16:14] deck in the order of the shuffle deck
[00:16:16] and the winners the time by the least
[00:16:19] amount of time used
[00:16:20] [Music]
[00:16:22] 21 year old Michael mirsky currently
[00:16:24] holds fourth place but he knows just one
[00:16:27] mistake and speed cards could send him
[00:16:29] home so he spent every possible free
[00:16:31] moment practicing
[00:16:35] the moment that you understand that your
[00:16:37] mind is really good at converting
[00:16:38] information to more visual stuff it's
[00:16:41] very much like a mind-blowing experience
[00:16:42] your head actually starts to hurt and
[00:16:44] like that's actually a signal that
[00:16:45] you're learning that your mind's kind of
[00:16:46] like warping like a way to like learn
[00:16:48] new material
[00:16:49] even though Michael's barely old enough
[00:16:52] to buy a drink he's a seasoned memory
[00:16:54] vet who has been honing his craft for
[00:16:57] years he started to learn how to
[00:16:58] memorize a deck of cards when I was in
[00:17:00] high school it was more so just kind of
[00:17:01] for fun it was like a hobby whenever I
[00:17:04] walked to class I actually bring a deck
[00:17:05] of cards with me but I found that that's
[00:17:07] the best way to kind of like to happen
[00:17:08] to distractions what motivates me for
[00:17:10] the competition it is a competition
[00:17:12] itself
[00:17:13] mental athletes you may begin
[00:17:17] Michael mirsky is just one of many
[00:17:20] successful 20-something mental athletes
[00:17:22] who have experts believing that the
[00:17:24] memory Championship is a young man's
[00:17:26] game why because by our late teens our
[00:17:30] brain's recall ability begins to
[00:17:32] diminish and after the age of 30 neuron
[00:17:35] loss rapidly increases
[00:17:37] but 39 year old two-time champ Ronnie
[00:17:40] White intends to prove that the brain
[00:17:42] can age like a fine wine I feel like I'm
[00:17:46] representing every guy out there who
[00:17:48] feels like he's getting too old you know
[00:17:50] everybody's 15 years younger I'm not
[00:17:52] over the hill you know the pacemaker
[00:17:54] hasn't been put in yet you know
[00:17:58] but at 39 are Ronnie's best years behind
[00:18:01] him maybe not because Ronnie's doing
[00:18:04] what he can to fight off the effects of
[00:18:07] aging on the brain including getting a
[00:18:09] proper night's rest because that's when
[00:18:11] memory consolidation the process of
[00:18:13] forming and storing new memories takes
[00:18:15] place and most important of all he keeps
[00:18:18] his brain active for the speed card
[00:18:21] event Ronnie relies on the Pao system he
[00:18:24] spent months in training assigning every
[00:18:27] card its own person action object so for
[00:18:30] the Jack of clubs I have Billy the Kid
[00:18:32] robbing a bank but to remember the exact
[00:18:35] sequence of cards Ronnie uses an extra
[00:18:38] trick mental athletes call A Memory
[00:18:40] Palace he imagines each person object
[00:18:43] and action in a place he knows well
[00:18:45] we're all familiar with our homes all of
[00:18:47] us can walk around our home in the
[00:18:49] middle of the night with all the lights
[00:18:50] off and not bump into any furniture
[00:18:51] because we know we've already memorized
[00:18:53] it Ronnie mentally plants each image
[00:18:56] along a specific path that he already
[00:18:58] knows like the back of his hand to
[00:19:00] recall the sequence of cards he mentally
[00:19:03] retraces his steps and sees those images
[00:19:05] waiting for him the next card is the
[00:19:08] five of Hearts that's Neil Armstrong
[00:19:11] five of Spades is Whispering and the
[00:19:14] Seven of Hearts is water so right here I
[00:19:17] have Niels Armstrong Whispering the
[00:19:20] water on my couch as I see each card I
[00:19:23] think of the picture and then I place
[00:19:24] those pictures on the furniture this
[00:19:27] Century's old memorization technique
[00:19:29] could be the trick that brings Ronnie
[00:19:31] another title America should be pulling
[00:19:34] from me just because I'm just an average
[00:19:36] guy you know I'm not a savant I'm not
[00:19:38] I'm not a rain man I'm just a guy who
[00:19:41] used a system in practice
[00:19:43] [Music]
[00:19:52] the memorization period over the mental
[00:19:55] athletes now have five minutes to place
[00:19:58] their deck in the correct order
[00:20:03] foreign
[00:20:12] [Music]
[00:20:19] [Music]
[00:20:24] ERS will now compare their Deck with the
[00:20:27] original deck to see if they match
[00:20:30] against your moderators
[00:20:36] good job
[00:20:41] I switched I'm
[00:20:44] for former champ Ronnie White a
[00:20:47] perfectly matched deck will cement him a
[00:20:49] spot in the championship round but one
[00:20:52] wrong card could send him home
[00:21:00] [Music]
[00:21:04] four hours ago 50 people began battling
[00:21:08] for the title best memory in America but
[00:21:11] only eight will advance to the afternoon
[00:21:13] events and two former Champions are
[00:21:15] dueling for the last spot
[00:21:18] [Music]
[00:21:27] Chester Santos's deck is a perfect match
[00:21:30] and for the moment he moves into the
[00:21:32] coveted eighth and final spot
[00:21:35] however if Ronnie White's deck is a
[00:21:38] perfect match he will reclaim that last
[00:21:40] position and advance to the championship
[00:21:42] rounds
[00:21:45] [Music]
[00:21:47] thank you
[00:21:52] all right
[00:21:55] just made uh two silly mistakes I knew
[00:21:58] it was the seven of Spades and the Ten
[00:22:00] of clubs and I reversed them I'm very
[00:22:02] disappointed I'm very very very
[00:22:03] disappointed
[00:22:06] the elite eight is finalized and it
[00:22:08] includes
[00:22:10] [Applause]
[00:22:22] Johnny Johnny
[00:22:24] [Applause]
[00:22:37] for two of the remaining athletes this
[00:22:40] is their first trip to the elite eight
[00:22:42] but for seven-time finalist Rob Coley
[00:22:45] this stage has become like a second home
[00:22:48] experience has taught him how to handle
[00:22:50] the pressure which will be a huge
[00:22:51] advantage in the first championship
[00:22:53] round words to remember what's to
[00:22:56] remember is one of the more exciting
[00:22:58] events we're given about 200 words and
[00:23:00] 15 minutes to memorize the eight of us
[00:23:02] said in randomized order and then recall
[00:23:04] one word after another It's tricky
[00:23:06] because your first mistake you're gone
[00:23:09] before this year's competition ROM set
[00:23:12] out to recreate the pressure of
[00:23:14] performing in front of a live audience
[00:23:15] by practicing at the Santa Monica Pier
[00:23:20] so I needed like 10 words from each of
[00:23:22] you I'm going to try to memorize them in
[00:23:23] about two minutes
[00:23:26] you guys done yeah let me get those from
[00:23:29] you
[00:23:29] [Music]
[00:23:37] all right let's try the recall now
[00:23:40] I think the first one I've gotten it
[00:23:42] raised a little bit I think it's Cruiser

[00:24:02] shark
[00:24:05] and keyboard yes
[00:24:07] ROM Nails 29 out of 30. a good score for
[00:24:10] the boardwalk but at last year's memory
[00:24:12] Championship 70 words were recalled so
[00:24:15] if ROM wants to recapture the title he's
[00:24:18] going to have to step his game up
[00:24:21] it's time for the first championship
[00:24:23] round
[00:24:24] after a 15-minute memorization period
[00:24:26] the mental athletes will now take turns
[00:24:29] reciting the words in order the first
[00:24:31] three to miss a word are knocked out
[00:24:35] asparagus asparagus is the correct first
[00:24:38] word

[00:25:08] without skipping a beat
[00:25:11] that is 10 rounds of words

[00:28:12] storm of memory challenges
[00:28:15] the three strikes event is based on the
[00:28:18] six audience members coming up to the

[00:37:20] take all event
[00:37:22] each mental athlete is given an
[00:37:25] identical double deck of shuffled cards
[00:37:27] they have five minutes to commit the
[00:37:29] sequence of cards to memory a single
[00:37:32] mistake means elimination and soon there
[00:37:35] will be only one left the USA memory
[00:37:38] Champion
[00:37:40] the mental athletes have their cards and
[00:37:43] are heading backstage to begin
[00:37:45] memorization any of these men could win
[00:37:47] it but the odds on favorite is Nelson
[00:37:50] who recalled two full decks during last
[00:37:52] year's finals a lot of people think
[00:37:54] Nelson is Untouchable but he's mortal
[00:37:56] just like everyone else
[00:37:58] people say Nelson is unbeatable at
[00:38:01] double deck but to me he's not
[00:38:03] anything can happen it's not a sure
[00:38:05] thing
[00:38:10] time's up gentlemen
[00:38:15] [Music]
[00:38:22] wanna roll with the big boys and this is
[00:38:25] how fast the world record holder Simon
[00:38:27] Reinhold memorizes cards he mentally
[00:38:30] inhaled an entire deck in just 21
[00:38:33] seconds about how long it takes Usain
[00:38:36] Bolt to run the 200 meter dash
[00:38:40] foreign
[00:38:41] [Music]

[00:39:02] way to Victory Ken perennial Challenger
[00:39:04] ROM Cole finally captured that elusive
[00:39:07] second title or will the Superman of
[00:39:11] memory Nelson Dallas win his third
[00:39:13] championship in a row the answers to
[00:39:16] these questions are in the cards because
[00:39:19] competitors will take turns recalling
[00:39:21] the sequence of two shuffled decks this
[00:39:24] is sudden death one mistake and a mental
[00:39:28] athlete is eliminated
[00:39:30] well let me start with giving me the
[00:39:32] first card
[00:39:33] four states
[00:39:35] queen of us Ace of clubs three of clubs
[00:39:39] King of Clubs
[00:39:41] six of Spades two of Hearts five of us
[00:39:45] Jack and Diamond three of hearts
[00:39:48] these masters of memory breathe through
[00:39:50] the first ten cards next card
[00:40:00] all right
[00:40:06] neither skates
[00:40:07] [Applause]
[00:40:12] two diamonds
[00:40:14] eight of diamonds
[00:40:18] eight of spades
[00:40:20] eight of clubs nine of ones nine of
[00:40:24] diamonds two of Clubs
[00:40:27] [Music]
[00:40:28] photopods
[00:40:40] this is a tricky one
[00:40:43] um
[00:40:51] I don't know it
[00:40:54] Michael's Championship Dreams Are Over
[00:41:00] all this memorizing it's a mental stress
[00:41:02] I'm kind of feeling almost physically
[00:41:04] exhausted from it
[00:41:05] I just couldn't do it
[00:41:07] 50 competitors began this competition
[00:41:10] now it's down to just two okay
[00:41:15] six of diamonds
[00:41:21] tell us faith
[00:41:24] nine of hearts
[00:41:30] to speak
[00:41:33] Queen of Clubs
[00:41:35] Jack of Hearts
[00:41:37] um
[00:41:38] two of spades
[00:41:44] Nelson has made an error at card 33. if
[00:41:49] Ron can name the next card he will pull
[00:41:52] off the upset and capture the USA memory
[00:41:55] championship
[00:41:59] Ace of space
[00:42:00] [Applause]
[00:42:16] I lost
[00:42:18] I knew both decks I still know them
[00:42:22] it was just this moment I stepped out of
[00:42:24] my head for a second I said nine of
[00:42:26] Hearts looked over at my girlfriend gave
[00:42:28] her a little smile because she's a man
[00:42:30] of hearts and I think that's what kind
[00:42:31] of
[00:42:32] put me out congratulations
[00:42:36] [Music]
[00:42:39] I can't believe it uh just won the 2013
[00:42:43] American memory Championship so I just
[00:42:46] feel relieved just happy
[00:42:49] you took him eight years but it
[00:42:52] determined Ron Coley has won his second
[00:42:54] USA memory championship and the title
[00:42:57] best memory in America
[00:42:59] [Applause]
[00:43:00] [Music]
[00:43:01] [Applause]


=== everyone on TIKTOK is a MEMORY EXPERT suddenly 😒 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcQwoVfzVuU

[00:00:00] read it silently in your mind close your
[00:00:02] eyes and recite it in your mind say it
[00:00:03] out loud and again with the eyes closed
[00:00:05] that's it I mean yeah that's typically
[00:00:07] how most memory works you look at it you
[00:00:10] read it you say it in your mind and then
[00:00:11] you say it out loud I mean that's not
[00:00:12] really a hack it's like how anybody with
[00:00:15] any right mind would try to memorize
[00:00:18] something many of you may know that I am
[00:00:19] an avid Tick Tock poster and can't no I
[00:00:24] I'm just kidding I have very little
[00:00:26] presence on Tick Tock and I beg of you
[00:00:28] not to even search my name there are
[00:00:31] maybe some videos there that I don't
[00:00:32] want uh visible anyways it's come to my
[00:00:35] attention that there are a plethora of
[00:00:38] memory technique memory demonstration
[00:00:41] Tick Tock videos now as a world-renowned
[00:00:44] memory technique and demonstration
[00:00:46] debunker verifier expert I figured it's
[00:00:50] just me doing my job to go check them
[00:00:53] out and see what I think of them a lot
[00:00:55] of stuff on Tick Tock we know is garbage
[00:00:56] and it's just kind of there to get a
[00:00:58] like or for somebody to stick around not
[00:01:00] necessarily factual or potentially even
[00:01:03] worth looking at but that's what that's
[00:01:05] what I'm for that is what I will provide
[00:01:07] for you so when you're scrolling through
[00:01:09] Tick Tock and mindlessly stopping at
[00:01:11] something that says hey this could help
[00:01:13] your memory or this will help you Ace
[00:01:14] some tests try this memory trick you'll
[00:01:16] know whether to keep scrolling or not so
[00:01:18] let's dive in I have no idea what we're
[00:01:20] gonna find here a bit nervous to be
[00:01:21] honest uh but um yeah let's
[00:01:24] um let's uh let's do this let me get
[00:01:28] comfortable here there we go that's
[00:01:30] better if you have trouble memorizing
[00:01:32] when you study that may be why this
[00:01:35] video ended up upon your for you page
[00:01:37] here are my three best study memory tips
[00:01:39] one study for short periods of intense
[00:01:43] Focus study for short periods of intense
[00:01:45] Focus yeah this is great this is what I
[00:01:47] do all the time it's called the Pomodoro
[00:01:48] Technique kiss and take mental breaks in
[00:01:52] between taking the breaks is super
[00:01:54] important you can focus for these short
[00:01:56] bursts of time you can take a mental
[00:01:58] break take a load off for a second and
[00:02:00] then go back to an intense Focus session
[00:02:02] that's super helpful and super effective
[00:02:04] what she's kind of talking about here is
[00:02:05] something called interleaving where you
[00:02:07] do something for a certain amount of
[00:02:08] time studying and then you take a break
[00:02:10] and do something else for five minutes
[00:02:12] so she said take a break actually if you
[00:02:14] did something entirely different with
[00:02:16] your mind maybe do some math problems or
[00:02:19] read a book or something and then come
[00:02:21] back that is actually more effective
[00:02:23] Studies have shown that so interleaving
[00:02:25] number two write down questions about
[00:02:28] the material as you're studying it yeah
[00:02:31] and then writing questions about the
[00:02:32] material that's great because it makes
[00:02:34] you really focus on what you're
[00:02:36] memorizing and learning you know you're
[00:02:38] going to come up with questions that you
[00:02:40] have and then you realize what you need
[00:02:42] or what you don't understand and what
[00:02:44] you need to learn better that
[00:02:47] answer all of the questions and explain
[00:02:49] it to someone this is great these are
[00:02:51] all really great study techniques you
[00:02:54] know answering questions and explaining
[00:02:55] it to someone else that's the Feynman
[00:02:57] technique where you explain what you
[00:02:58] think you know in your own words as best
[00:03:01] as you can and that really proves that
[00:03:03] you know something and if you don't you
[00:03:05] know what you have to go back and
[00:03:06] re-study yeah this one's awesome good
[00:03:08] one this is how you hack your memory
[00:03:11] part one mnemonics imagine you needed to
[00:03:13] memorize somebody's phone number or a
[00:03:15] card sequence what you do is associate
[00:03:18] the number of the card with an image
[00:03:19] then you create a story using those
[00:03:21] images in the chronological order of the
[00:03:23] cards or the numbers example if you want
[00:03:25] to remember one two three four five
[00:03:26] think about Association if you want to
[00:03:28] remember what to do for five just
[00:03:30] remember one two three four five so the
[00:03:31] combination is one two three four five
[00:03:36] put his combination I ever heard in my
[00:03:38] life and so one for me is maybe Harry
[00:03:40] Potter because he was the one the chosen
[00:03:41] one two are the twins or Gemini three is
[00:03:44] a braid four is the guy from Umbrella
[00:03:46] Academy five is a pig Harry Potter who
[00:03:49] just found out that he's a Gemini
[00:03:52] started braiding for his hair while he
[00:03:55] was sitting on the pig for the comfort
[00:03:56] yeah I mean that's great that's she has
[00:03:59] a system for turning numbers into images
[00:04:01] and then linking them into a story
[00:04:03] that's great more effective than that is
[00:04:05] to have maybe every two digits represent
[00:04:08] one image that will get you further and
[00:04:10] if you want to go even further than that
[00:04:12] three digits per image would be
[00:04:15] in 2006 a man named Clemens mayor
[00:04:18] memorized 1040 random digits in half an
[00:04:21] hour is that correct 1040 digits
[00:04:25] in half an hour I don't think so let's
[00:04:28] double check that I don't think those
[00:04:30] stats are correct competitions World
[00:04:33] Championships
[00:04:35] 2006. Clemens Mary was the winner I
[00:04:37] remember him I've never met him let's
[00:04:39] see yeah so first of all there's no
[00:04:41] 30-minute discipline at the world memory
[00:04:43] championships so in 2006 he did 1720
[00:04:47] digits in 60 minutes there was a 30
[00:04:50] minute numbers event in the German open
[00:04:53] in 2005 and that's where he got 1040
[00:04:55] which is really good a thousand digits
[00:04:57] in half an hour yeah that's incredible
[00:04:59] anyways let's go back he became the
[00:05:01] world memory champion and here's the
[00:05:04] technique he used it's known as the
[00:05:06] memory Journey if you want to memorize
[00:05:11] Memory Palace method of low size is your
[00:05:14] house place items you want to memorize
[00:05:16] at points along the journey imagine
[00:05:18] items on your bed bookshelf table and so
[00:05:21] on cool okay yeah that's right Memory
[00:05:23] Palace technique there you go I'm going
[00:05:25] to teach you how to memorize anything
[00:05:27] and easily you can use this to study for
[00:05:30] an exam or as just a cool party trick I
[00:05:33] memorized all the US presidents in order
[00:05:36] as well as all the states and capitals
[00:05:38] in about an hour using this technique
[00:05:40] the idea is linking together short-term
[00:05:43] memory and long-term memory short-term
[00:05:45] memory is going to be the list of things
[00:05:46] you want to memorize for long-term
[00:05:48] memory we're going to pick a local
[00:05:50] memory box I've never heard somebody
[00:05:51] kind of refer to it that way but yeah I
[00:05:53] would imagine this is going to be a very
[00:05:56] common theme it's so weird for me
[00:05:58] honestly to hear people who are not in
[00:06:01] the memory World talk about this it's
[00:06:04] what I do for a living and I usually
[00:06:06] blow people's minds when I talk about it
[00:06:07] so hearing random people just talk about
[00:06:10] it on Tick Tock like it's
[00:06:12] something they discovered is weird it
[00:06:14] feels weird it feels wrong I mean I love
[00:06:17] that it's being shared but it just feels
[00:06:19] like
[00:06:20] I don't know I know that I use this
[00:06:22] technique in its proper form and to the
[00:06:25] max I really know how to use it I don't
[00:06:27] know if these people really know how to
[00:06:28] use it you know what I mean it makes me
[00:06:30] feel weird to see all these tick tocks
[00:06:31] about that
[00:06:32] [Music]
[00:06:36] read it silently in your mind
[00:06:38] close your eyes and recite it in your
[00:06:40] mind
[00:06:41] say it out loud and again with the eyes
[00:06:43] closed that's it yeah
[00:06:46] I mean yeah that's typically how most
[00:06:49] memory works is you look at it you read
[00:06:51] it you say it in your mind and then you
[00:06:52] say it out loud I mean that's not really
[00:06:54] a hack it's like how anybody with any
[00:06:57] right mind would try to memorize
[00:06:58] something definitely watching this video
[00:07:00] till the end will permanently improve
[00:07:03] your memory forever have you ever heard
[00:07:05] of the Roman room technique it's another
[00:07:07] Memory Palace I mean it's cool different
[00:07:09] people are sharing it in different ways
[00:07:11] that's awesome it feels like somebody's
[00:07:12] taking this out of my mouth and made a
[00:07:14] tick tock out of it a simple trick to
[00:07:16] instantly boost your memory clench your
[00:07:18] right fist for 90 seconds when learning
[00:07:19] new information clench your left fist to
[00:07:21] recall the information later this comes
[00:07:23] from a study out of Montclair State
[00:07:25] University where participants who use
[00:07:26] this trick had increased brain
[00:07:28] performance I've never heard that and
[00:07:30] that seems absolutely bizarre that you
[00:07:32] would clench this fist while you're
[00:07:33] memorizing the information and then you
[00:07:35] would clench the other fists to recall
[00:07:38] it I would say you do the same one
[00:07:40] because when you're memorizing something
[00:07:42] if you do anything physical that's out
[00:07:44] of the ordinary that's going to help you
[00:07:45] remember remember the information that's
[00:07:48] a very obvious thing so clenching a fist
[00:07:50] it doesn't even have to be clenching a
[00:07:52] fist could be something else although
[00:07:53] clenching a fist I could imagine you you
[00:07:55] can feel that uh
[00:07:57] like the squeezing I think is maybe
[00:08:00] going to be something that's you're more
[00:08:01] aware of
[00:08:02] um whereas if you just went like that or
[00:08:04] something or like did a loop with your
[00:08:06] finger I don't know those aren't as like
[00:08:08] impactful on your awareness of it but I
[00:08:11] don't think the different hands really
[00:08:13] do anything there could be wrong but uh
[00:08:15] it seems kind of sus five ways to
[00:08:17] improve your memorizing skills one read
[00:08:19] it out loud two try to understand the
[00:08:21] information first three right now
[00:08:24] multiple times four test yourself and
[00:08:26] five avoid over cramming yeah I mean it
[00:08:28] sounds like there's two different
[00:08:29] categories of tips here there's ones
[00:08:31] that are like the obvious ones like if
[00:08:33] you've never used your memory or studied
[00:08:35] for anything in your life you'd read
[00:08:37] this and be like oh okay I mean who
[00:08:40] doesn't do this I don't understand and
[00:08:42] then there's the one that are actually
[00:08:43] talking about memory techniques uh
[00:08:45] memory hacks mnemonics I mean I guess
[00:08:47] it's nice to see things like this
[00:08:49] because you're like oh okay maybe I
[00:08:52] should do more of that but man sometimes
[00:08:55] tick tock's just like showing you the
[00:08:57] dumbest things that you should already
[00:08:58] know or that you're already doing and
[00:09:00] you're just like yes yes I will watch
[00:09:03] this video because it's telling me what
[00:09:04] I already know that if you jerk off too
[00:09:07] much it can cause severe memory loss
[00:09:08] even though I doubt that would happen to
[00:09:10] anyone I'm gonna give you three tips I
[00:09:12] like that he had that that was like to
[00:09:14] lure you in cities have shown that if
[00:09:15] you get a consistent seven to eight
[00:09:17] hours of sleep your memory will improve
[00:09:18] sure sleep is important get enough sleep
[00:09:21] Studies have shown that if you get a
[00:09:22] consistent seven to eight hours of sleep
[00:09:24] your memory will improve three get
[00:09:26] enough sleep Studies have shown that if
[00:09:28] you get a consistent get your sleep
[00:09:30] totally right if you have awful memory
[00:09:32] and you want to improve your
[00:09:33] concentration here's a hot girl tip that
[00:09:35] will save your life if you're like me
[00:09:36] and you have midterms coming up and you
[00:09:37] have the memory of a freaking fly well
[00:09:39] here you go you need to eat and drink
[00:09:41] more Rosemary Rosemary is really good at
[00:09:42] improving memory and concentration make
[00:09:44] sure falling for more hot girl too she
[00:09:46] clearly just read this somewhere
[00:09:47] Rosemary is good for memory why how in
[00:09:49] general smell is a very powerful memory
[00:09:54] the sense of smell is one of the
[00:09:56] earliest senses evolved in our brain
[00:09:57] brain so it actually bypasses a certain
[00:10:00] part of the brain the thalamus which is
[00:10:01] responsible for kind of delegating where
[00:10:04] a sense perception will go if it will go
[00:10:07] to like the amygdala or the hippocampus
[00:10:09] so smell goes directly to those parts so
[00:10:12] it kind of bypasses that so which is why
[00:10:14] we have a memory of a smell or something
[00:10:15] it just like instantly takes you back so
[00:10:18] smell and maybe it's Rosemary because
[00:10:20] it's such a powerful herb smell yeah
[00:10:22] here's how to instantly improve your
[00:10:24] working memory without any extra
[00:10:26] training you can improve your working
[00:10:28] memory with an ability called chunking
[00:10:30] which is just a fancy way of saying
[00:10:31] grouping items together for example
[00:10:33] chunking is key that's what we do with
[00:10:35] numbers cards instead of trying to
[00:10:37] remember I need to buy bread mints
[00:10:39] cheese onions tomatoes pickles and
[00:10:43] mayonnaise you can simply chunk those
[00:10:44] seven items down into one word in this
[00:10:46] case a juicy burger Yep this is like the
[00:10:49] most basic memory technique you can do
[00:10:52] is any information that you have try to
[00:10:55] compress it into something smaller well
[00:10:58] not smaller but try to group it into one
[00:11:01] thing or fewer things that Encompass all
[00:11:04] the things so right there we had a list
[00:11:05] of basically grocery items but all in
[00:11:07] all it was basically what goes on in
[00:11:09] Burger so remember the burger rather
[00:11:11] than like 10 items that need to go on
[00:11:13] the burger yeah researchers show that
[00:11:15] exercising just one
[00:11:17] is excitatory synoptic current
[00:11:22] at least three days post exercise you
[00:11:25] can see right here how the cells have
[00:11:26] way more branches after exercise meaning
[00:11:29] that there is an increased ability for
[00:11:30] cells to make connections and
[00:11:32] communicate with each other in the area
[00:11:34] of the brain responsible for learning
[00:11:36] and memory well said I love that and it
[00:11:39] sounded like she memorized that very
[00:11:41] well she said it very authoritatively I
[00:11:43] like that but cool yeah exercise is
[00:11:44] great for your memory I didn't know the
[00:11:46] Neuroscience behind it so specifically
[00:11:48] so thank you I'm about to share with you
[00:11:51] one of the most profound things that
[00:11:52] I've ever learned and it will change
[00:11:54] your life this is out of the Silva mind
[00:11:56] map oh the silver method okay anything
[00:11:59] that you believe you have forgotten is
[00:12:01] associated with an event you don't
[00:12:04] actually forget anything
[00:12:07] get this I don't know about that if it
[00:12:09] is a name the event well I would say
[00:12:13] maybe the connections are lost I would
[00:12:16] say that there are things that you
[00:12:17] forget but maybe what she means is it's
[00:12:20] all in there and I'm more of that I
[00:12:22] believe something along those lines that
[00:12:24] most of the stuff that you do remember
[00:12:25] or memorize at one point is in there
[00:12:28] it's just you can't access it through
[00:12:30] the neural Pathways you've forgotten or
[00:12:31] lost those connections but she's saying
[00:12:33] you can access associated with the name
[00:12:35] is the time you heard or read it so if
[00:12:39] you can remember the time and place that
[00:12:42] you were when somebody first told you
[00:12:44] their name you can find it in the in
[00:12:47] your mind no no
[00:12:50] um
[00:12:50] you know I do events all the time and I
[00:12:52] memorize a lot of people's names but if
[00:12:54] I were to think of the event I wouldn't
[00:12:56] suddenly remember all hundred of the
[00:12:59] people that I memorized you know what I
[00:13:00] mean maybe some might come to mind but I
[00:13:03] don't think this is as effective as
[00:13:04] she's making it sound all you have to do
[00:13:06] once you learn to work with your mental
[00:13:09] screen is to visualize a past event that
[00:13:12] surrounds an incident you believe you
[00:13:14] have forgotten and it will I mean I
[00:13:17] think this is just like yeah you're
[00:13:18] trying to find ways to jog your memory
[00:13:19] but I don't think it's a Surefire way
[00:13:21] that she makes it sound a lot easier
[00:13:23] well she doesn't the silver method makes
[00:13:25] it sound a lot easier than it is I was
[00:13:26] today years old when I found out
[00:13:29] you meet someone and they say their name
[00:13:31] is John you don't hear their name and
[00:13:33] just move on and you come back like what
[00:13:36] was his name again because he actually
[00:13:38] didn't hear it in the first place 90 of
[00:13:41] the information we receive is visual so
[00:13:43] we store more images in our memory than
[00:13:45] sounds which makes it harder to
[00:13:47] recognize and remember names when we
[00:13:49] first hear them the first thing you have
[00:13:51] to do is concentrate and make a point of
[00:13:54] hearing the name then you have 20
[00:13:57] seconds this is for my brother uh Kevin
[00:13:59] Horsley I saw his name there I can hear
[00:14:00] his accent he has an awesome memory book
[00:14:04] um called unlimited memory I would
[00:14:06] recommend it uh the ebook on Amazon but
[00:14:08] anyways yeah he's talking about you know
[00:14:10] making sure that you heard the name and
[00:14:11] that you were paying attention that's
[00:14:12] the number one step of memorizing a name
[00:14:14] forget any other technique if you do
[00:14:16] that you will definitely improve your
[00:14:18] memory for names I asked Google about
[00:14:20] superhuman memory
[00:14:23] and I came across the Loki method
[00:14:25] another method of locate let's keep
[00:14:26] going hey you're trying to improve your
[00:14:28] memory think about using the Loki method
[00:14:30] oh my God there's an absolutely
[00:14:32] life-changing technique that improves
[00:14:34] your memory by 140 degrees
[00:14:37] good memory is everything it works for
[00:14:40] remembering exam answers or learning new
[00:14:42] things remembering you want to keep
[00:14:44] watching for making a profitable trade
[00:14:46] or just simply making mental notes of
[00:14:48] things you must remember and I've been
[00:14:51] doing this for my car keys you've been
[00:14:52] doing tell me I need to know come on
[00:14:54] it's called the locium what was that
[00:14:56] method okay memory hacks if you're
[00:14:59] struggling to remember a word clench
[00:15:00] your fist it increases brain activity
[00:15:02] and you're mixing your fist again what's
[00:15:04] with the cleansing the first yes if you
[00:15:05] do anything with your body it doesn't
[00:15:06] have to be clenching your fist it could
[00:15:08] be anything it could be like it could be
[00:15:10] banging your head against the wall you
[00:15:12] will remember better what you were doing
[00:15:14] when you did that thing make a mnemonic
[00:15:16] that's emotional bizarre
[00:15:21] for classes like anatomy and history
[00:15:23] where there's a ton of terms and Bland
[00:15:26] information the point of the mnemonic is
[00:15:27] to decrease the mental load because our
[00:15:30] short-term memory
[00:15:31] seven meaningful items that number has
[00:15:34] changed a little bit over the years but
[00:15:35] not much so try to pick words with
[00:15:37] emotional connotations
[00:15:39] um even cuss words because our brains
[00:15:42] remember emotional information more than
[00:15:45] non-emotional information that's true
[00:15:46] you can make it happy sad make you angry
[00:15:50] make you excited related to ourselves so
[00:15:54] we evolved in a way that we will better
[00:15:56] recall that information so anything you
[00:15:59] can personalize or make it important to
[00:16:00] you you will remember better it's a
[00:16:02] survival technique right what anchors
[00:16:04] the new information to a stable memory
[00:16:07] in your brain making it easier to access
[00:16:08] lastly make it bizarre so something like
[00:16:11] pink zebra is gonna stick out and grab
[00:16:14] our attention more than zebra and the
[00:16:16] more attention that is paid to something
[00:16:17] the more likely it'll be Consolidated
[00:16:19] into our memory correct yeah just make
[00:16:21] it out of the ordinary exaggerated in
[00:16:24] size or by different features how it
[00:16:26] smells how it looks all that kind of
[00:16:28] stuff and it will stand out in your
[00:16:30] memory and make it more memorable this
[00:16:31] is part two of
[00:16:33] science that you probably haven't heard
[00:16:34] of the second study hack is to recreate
[00:16:37] your learning environment this might
[00:16:38] look like using the same pen for a
[00:16:40] certain subject or maybe so this goes we
[00:16:42] don't have social thing but basically
[00:16:44] talks about the same thing about the
[00:16:45] clenching thing if you're doing
[00:16:46] something physical while you're setting
[00:16:48] and you do that same thing or you
[00:16:49] imitate it you'll probably remember
[00:16:51] better a few things from that moment
[00:16:53] that you were doing the thing so that
[00:16:54] goes for where you actually study you
[00:16:56] know if you're always studying the same
[00:16:57] place that might not be so effective but
[00:16:59] if you get up and go somewhere brand new
[00:17:00] or out of the ordinary where you don't
[00:17:02] typically study you know go to a
[00:17:04] different couch or go sit by the window
[00:17:05] go outside go to a coffee shop you will
[00:17:07] probably remember more from that study
[00:17:09] session than any other because it was so
[00:17:11] out of the ordinary and now you're
[00:17:13] placing yourself in that location when
[00:17:15] you studied when you're remembering the
[00:17:17] thing that you studied there anyways
[00:17:19] let's stop there I guess those were
[00:17:21] really cool some were kind of whatever
[00:17:23] it's super cool to see that there's some
[00:17:25] stuff on Tick Tock out there making
[00:17:27] memory techniques popular and cool but
[00:17:29] again yeah it feels weird that you know
[00:17:31] people in this space that's not been
[00:17:34] that popular for very long at least
[00:17:35] since I've been in it is now kind of
[00:17:38] popular regular people are just talking
[00:17:39] about the things that they use or that
[00:17:41] they've heard about or saw in other tick
[00:17:43] tocks right pretty cool anyways thought
[00:17:45] that was fun maybe we can look at some
[00:17:46] more next time please don't forget to
[00:17:47] like And subscribe I'll see you in the
[00:17:49] next video I am out

=== I tried using AI ART to memorize cards… ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3_eoUE66q8

[00:00:00] this video is sponsored by mindlab Pro
[00:00:02] we live in very interesting times
[00:00:05] there are now tools that can generate
[00:00:07] images from text and these AI tools can
[00:00:10] create something entirely new that's
[00:00:12] never been seen before from scratch this
[00:00:15] is a deck of cards I memorized them
[00:00:17] often but when I try to explain to
[00:00:20] people what the heck I'm envisioning in
[00:00:22] my weird ass Memory Palace it sometimes
[00:00:24] gets met with some blank stares
[00:00:27] confusion and a lot of head scratching
[00:00:29] turns out it's hard to explain to
[00:00:32] someone what exactly you're envisioning
[00:00:34] in your mind the description you give is
[00:00:37] never going to have a hundred percent
[00:00:38] Fidelity to what it actually is compared
[00:00:41] to your own personal conscious
[00:00:44] experience in other words it's really
[00:00:46] hard to explain the weird ass images
[00:00:49] that are going on in my brain but no
[00:00:51] more my friends because of the
[00:00:52] advancements in Ai and the available AI
[00:00:55] art generating tools I'm now able to
[00:00:58] share the crazy things that are going on
[00:01:00] in my brain when I memorize a deck of
[00:01:02] cards with all of you
[00:01:05] in today's video I figured we could play
[00:01:07] around with some of the AI options here
[00:01:09] and see if we can generate images that
[00:01:11] are close to what I'm actually
[00:01:12] envisioning so I figured we'll just
[00:01:15] Shuffle the deck
[00:01:16] I'll memorize a random sequence of these
[00:01:20] cards as I do many times a day every day
[00:01:24] and then we'll try to see if these
[00:01:26] generators can create what I'm actually
[00:01:28] seeing sounds good all right
[00:01:32] the way it works is like this I shuffled
[00:01:35] the deck of cards and then I start
[00:01:36] memorizing in groups of three every card
[00:01:40] represents either a person action or an
[00:01:43] object the first card of a set is a
[00:01:45] person the second card of a set is the
[00:01:47] action that that person is doing and the
[00:01:49] third card of that set is the object
[00:01:51] that is being used for that action by
[00:01:54] that person every triplet of a card is
[00:01:56] this very bizarre scene of a person
[00:01:58] doing an action with a thing I do this
[00:02:01] 17 times plus one card left over and
[00:02:04] this gives me a full deck 52 cards as
[00:02:06] I'm coming up with these images I place
[00:02:08] them along a route through a Memory
[00:02:11] Palace that helps me remember the order
[00:02:13] as you can tell there's a lot of
[00:02:15] imagination involved the weirder and
[00:02:18] more out there that you can make these
[00:02:20] pictures the more memorable the deck of
[00:02:22] cards will be two of clubs seven of
[00:02:25] clubs five of diamonds and eight of
[00:02:27] spades it doesn't really matter because
[00:02:29] the whole point of this video is not
[00:02:31] that I can memorize the deck of cards
[00:02:32] but that I can share what those images
[00:02:34] for that particular deck of cards that
[00:02:36] were shuffled through AI means so let's
[00:02:39] dive in here so the first three was
[00:02:41] seven of Hearts nine of clubs and Queen
[00:02:43] of Diamonds which translates some of
[00:02:45] these are personal so it'll be tricky to
[00:02:46] map here I have to give it a proper
[00:02:48] description so this is a friend of mine
[00:02:50] die her name's Diane her face is a
[00:02:54] shopping bag so let's keep this General
[00:02:57] she's actually a pizza chef it's from an
[00:02:59] old job I had so technically we could
[00:03:01] make this piece of chef with a
[00:03:04] shopping bag face let's generate that
[00:03:13] um you know what I like the first one
[00:03:15] that is not too bad although Diane uh
[00:03:18] let's see okay let's maybe make it a
[00:03:19] female she's a woman so gotta be a
[00:03:22] female let's see
[00:03:24] this is
[00:03:25] pretty terrifying but I will go with
[00:03:29] this one
[00:03:31] let's save that one uh let's create a
[00:03:34] collection here deck of cards create
[00:03:37] collection all right there we go that's
[00:03:40] gonna be in my dreams okay ex-girlfriend
[00:03:43] cooking some tears she's cooking some of
[00:03:46] her tears as she should
[00:03:48] foreign
[00:03:49] ex-girlfriend
[00:03:55] cooking
[00:03:57] her tears see what this does oh this is
[00:04:00] actually this is actually pretty dang
[00:04:02] good and the fact that these are not
[00:04:04] real people is quite terrifying well her
[00:04:07] face is kind of messed up
[00:04:10] yeah I kind of like this one yeah that's
[00:04:13] that's the one let's save it she's
[00:04:14] cooking her tears that's exactly kind of
[00:04:17] what I'm picturing except it's my
[00:04:19] ex-girlfriend unfortunately cool we're
[00:04:21] two for two we haven't had too much
[00:04:22] trouble here next we have uh C-3PO or
[00:04:25] robot uh solving a tongue like it's a
[00:04:28] Rubik's Cube kind of thing so that's
[00:04:29] gonna be hard to explain let's say C-3PO
[00:04:32] solving a Rubik's cube made of tongues
[00:04:38] that's not bad right uh yeah I don't
[00:04:43] I kind of like this one it's not made of
[00:04:46] tongues but it is his tongue
[00:04:48] so kind of and it's not quite C-3PO
[00:04:51] obviously be C3PO but he's a gold robot
[00:04:55] right with a Rubik's Cube tongue kind of
[00:04:58] what are you talking about next up uh we
[00:05:01] have Shaq Shaquille O'neal
[00:05:03] He is biting the head off of a mountain
[00:05:06] or he's eating a mountain okay Shack
[00:05:10] eating a mountain Shack
[00:05:15] no Shaquille O'Neal eating a mountain
[00:05:18] what
[00:05:20] what I don't even know what the
[00:05:26] honestly I I'd go between this one or
[00:05:29] this one I think this one looks like
[00:05:32] he's in the mountains and he's trying to
[00:05:34] eat a mountain yeah these are the stuff
[00:05:38] of nightmares my friend all right next
[00:05:40] up we got James Bond shaking his ass on
[00:05:43] a laptop all right I guess this is a
[00:05:46] generic James Bond here
[00:05:50] I kind of like this one because although
[00:05:52] he's not shaking it on the laptop I
[00:05:54] don't know what this blue bubble is but
[00:05:56] uh it looks like he's trying to seduce
[00:05:57] it and then you know flirting with it
[00:05:59] kind of with his provocative butt there
[00:06:02] so let's save that one that's the winner
[00:06:05] [Music]
[00:06:09] hey just wanted to pause this video for
[00:06:11] a second to acknowledge my sponsor the
[00:06:13] sponsor of this video Mind lab Pro it's
[00:06:15] a nootropic stack supplement that I take
[00:06:18] that helps keep my mental Edge now one
[00:06:21] of the cool things I wanted to talk
[00:06:22] about in this video is something new
[00:06:23] that they've come out with recently
[00:06:24] which are their nootropic brain bars
[00:06:27] these are like nutrition bars but they
[00:06:29] feed your brain I think is the coolest
[00:06:31] idea I don't know anything else like
[00:06:32] that on the market and they're delicious
[00:06:33] they have amazing flavors this one is
[00:06:35] Apple and cinnamon they have raisin and
[00:06:37] almond Maple and pecan and salted
[00:06:40] caramel now it's got omega-3 it's got
[00:06:42] phosphododlycerine choline a bunch of
[00:06:44] other stuff that are really good for
[00:06:45] your brain and it's stacked with
[00:06:47] nutrients so when you're on the go it's
[00:06:48] great to feed you and to feed your brain
[00:06:50] I'm giving five of these starter packs
[00:06:52] that come with four bars in there a
[00:06:53] taste test if you will I'm doing five of
[00:06:55] those away for the first five people to
[00:06:57] give me a sub and to also mention that
[00:06:59] they want to try this nutribar anyways
[00:07:01] back to the video all right next up we
[00:07:03] have Neil Diamond he's standing on a
[00:07:06] desk made up of boats sailboats that's
[00:07:08] gonna be tricky let's
[00:07:09] Neil Diamond standing on a sailboat desk
[00:07:16] okay all right
[00:07:18] [Music]
[00:07:21] not bad I kind of like this one he's
[00:07:24] standing on a desk that has sailboats on
[00:07:26] it and it's kind of made of sailboat
[00:07:28] wood I guess that does not look like
[00:07:30] Neil Diamond but I get the gist that it
[00:07:32] is Neil Diamond I could I could see that
[00:07:34] if I was blind hello Britney Spears uh
[00:07:38] signing her breasts signing her chest I
[00:07:42] don't even know it'll let me do breasts
[00:07:43] but
[00:07:45] um let's say her belly that didn't work
[00:07:48] either Britney Spears signing her back
[00:07:51] Britney Spears signing her shirt
[00:07:55] so for this one I ran into some issues
[00:07:58] here but uh female pop star signing her
[00:08:01] own shirt it's kind of the closest I got
[00:08:03] to and uh I think we got this one it
[00:08:06] kind of looks like Britney Spears she's
[00:08:07] signing her own chest area sort of so
[00:08:10] let's go with that one I'm Gonna Save
[00:08:12] that all right next we got Kobe Bryant
[00:08:15] is playing guitar with fire so Kobe
[00:08:19] Bryant
[00:08:21] uh playing guitar with fire now
[00:08:25] sometimes it's ambiguous because
[00:08:27] obviously I have a person action object
[00:08:28] and it could be you know a person oh
[00:08:31] stunning it could be that he's playing
[00:08:33] the guitar with like a pick that's made
[00:08:35] of fire or maybe he's playing guitar and
[00:08:38] it's resulting in fire right it's not
[00:08:40] always clear and open to interpretation
[00:08:42] so and it's interesting when I think
[00:08:43] about it I don't even really know if I
[00:08:45] know what I'm thinking it's just kind of
[00:08:47] like a amorphous
[00:08:49] the hang of Kobe with fire and a guitar
[00:08:52] but this is pretty good
[00:08:54] I like I like this one just because it
[00:08:57] looks like his face is melting uh
[00:08:59] although that's maybe a bit insensitive
[00:09:01] given you know so let's let's maybe
[00:09:04] retry this playing guitar made of flames
[00:09:08] this one just looks badass
[00:09:11] kind of
[00:09:15] I don't know it's between this one or
[00:09:17] this one I think it's got to be this one
[00:09:19] I mean it's a cool photo I think
[00:09:21] right yeah yeah maybe next up we have my
[00:09:25] friend uh she is now it's not gonna let
[00:09:28] me do this one ass
[00:09:30] a uh Chihuahua
[00:09:33] she's kind of like an influencer so
[00:09:35] maybe let's say influencer with a
[00:09:38] Chihuahua coming out of her butt it's
[00:09:42] gonna let me do that what
[00:09:46] I mean okay that doesn't look like her
[00:09:48] uh that's closer I this I think I'm just
[00:09:52] gonna choose this because I have no idea
[00:09:54] what this is this is terrifying I just
[00:09:57] don't know I'm gonna keep that one
[00:09:58] though that that is the winner sorry
[00:10:00] Janna
[00:10:01] that's you yeah wow Jack Black uh he's
[00:10:06] bouncing on his nose yes that is not
[00:10:08] Jack Black but it definitely looks like
[00:10:11] Jack Black but no nose okay let's let's
[00:10:14] go further Jack black actor
[00:10:17] jumping
[00:10:19] on a nose jumping with a nose underneath
[00:10:24] him we're getting close man he's jumping
[00:10:27] it definitely looks like Jack Black it's
[00:10:29] not Jack Black Jack Black I don't know
[00:10:31] with a nose on the floor over a nose are
[00:10:36] those noses I don't even know all right
[00:10:38] I'm gonna go with this one just because
[00:10:40] those kind of give an impression of some
[00:10:42] noses granted he's not bouncing on a
[00:10:44] nose but yeah I had some trouble with
[00:10:46] that one beautiful looking guy there
[00:10:48] Jason Alexander from Seinfeld he's sword
[00:10:51] fighting
[00:10:52] with a car wow okay yes
[00:10:56] I mean this this is the one right that
[00:10:58] looks like he's just cleaning the front
[00:11:00] of it
[00:11:01] I don't see the sword doesn't really
[00:11:04] look like him this is the one I love it
[00:11:07] yes okay now we got Larry David kind of
[00:11:10] in the same vein is urinating on a
[00:11:12] barbell doesn't like that one let's just
[00:11:14] say he's spilling something on a barbell
[00:11:16] just keep it PC there yeah all right
[00:11:18] yeah yeah I guess that's kind of a good
[00:11:21] one
[00:11:23] what man this is a pretty cool tool all
[00:11:27] right we're almost done we got Oscar De
[00:11:28] La Hoya the boxer he's sniping his own
[00:11:32] vagina
[00:11:34] his crotch maybe is that gonna let me do
[00:11:37] that no dang oh let's just say his pants

[00:11:49] his pants with a rifle that's
[00:11:53] kind of better yeah let's go with that I
[00:11:56] know that's not uh Oscar De La Hoya but
[00:11:58] I'm gonna I'm gonna go with it we'll
[00:12:00] take what we can get this is early
[00:12:01] technology right yeah like one day
[00:12:03] you'll probably be able to get exactly
[00:12:05] what you're looking for all right
[00:12:07] Stephen Hawking is teaching how to swing
[00:12:10] a golf club okay
[00:12:13] okay splitting a head Wing anyway I like
[00:12:18] this one it looks like he's kind of
[00:12:19] overseeing someone's lesson here and
[00:12:22] he's you know being he's looks super
[00:12:24] cool with his glasses and his Hugh
[00:12:26] Hefner robe on but he's teaching someone
[00:12:27] how to swing a golf club this is perfect
[00:12:29] a few more we got Harry Potter cutting
[00:12:33] a canoe so we have Harry Potter
[00:12:37] cutting a canoe with a pair of scissors
[00:12:43] that's really what's happening there wow
[00:12:46] yes
[00:12:47] I mean yes right I think this is the one
[00:12:51] it's a tiny canoe that definitely
[00:12:53] supposed to be Harry Potter uh I'm gonna
[00:12:54] go with this one I will say that my
[00:12:56] image is in my mind are a little more
[00:12:58] High Fidelity than these but um yeah it
[00:13:02] shares kind of the idea with you I hope
[00:13:04] all right this is my brother Spencer
[00:13:06] he's spinning uh a record so he's like
[00:13:10] spinning it like a top cool yeah I mean
[00:13:12] let's go with this
[00:13:14] um actually you know what let me see if
[00:13:16] I can make it a dreidel made out of
[00:13:18] vinyl
[00:13:20] records the spinning action is as if
[00:13:23] you're spinning a top like a dreidel ah
[00:13:25] this is more what I'm talking about so
[00:13:27] yes this is the one it looks like he's
[00:13:29] about to spin it kind of looks like my
[00:13:31] brother when he was younger I guess and
[00:13:33] there's that record all right this is
[00:13:34] the last image we have Jesus he's
[00:13:38] wearing a Batman mask and riding a horse
[00:13:41] so Jesus with a Batman mask riding a
[00:13:46] horse
[00:13:47] can't mess that one up that one's got to
[00:13:49] be pretty easy for this thing to figure
[00:13:51] out come on let's go okay so I mean yeah
[00:13:55] I don't know what this yellow thing is
[00:13:56] but we're getting there no this this is
[00:14:00] the one
[00:14:01] uh yeah this is the one looks like Jesus
[00:14:04] he's wearing a Batman mask sort of and
[00:14:06] he's definitely riding a horse and then
[00:14:08] yeah I always have a leftover card just
[00:14:09] because uh three images don't evenly go
[00:14:12] into 52 cards but that's okay we have
[00:14:14] the full deck here let's let's maybe
[00:14:16] take a look at
[00:14:17] my uh collection here
[00:14:21] my deck of cards
[00:14:23] so here we are so you want to memorize a
[00:14:26] deck of cards you gotta learn how to
[00:14:27] memorize these and what do I do with
[00:14:29] each of these images they each go in a
[00:14:31] Memory Palace that's a whole other level
[00:14:32] that
[00:14:33] um I haven't even explored with this
[00:14:35] let's see if I can remember this so this

[00:15:44] cool that I can even show you that right
[00:15:48] I know it's not a hundred percent but
[00:15:50] it's pretty dang cool what the future is
[00:15:52] made of and I can't wait to see what
[00:15:54] more I can do down the road anyways you
[00:15:56] want to see more of this AI stuff gives
[00:15:57] you kind of access into my weird ass
[00:15:59] brain that's pretty good not accurate
[00:16:01] but close enough anyways that's it for
[00:16:03] this video thought it'd be fun to try
[00:16:04] that out I'll see in the next one I am
[00:16:06] out
[00:16:10] [Music]
[00:16:16] thank you


=== the BEST brain supplements! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk6g0Ekuduk

[00:00:00] what the hell is a nootropic here is my
[00:00:02] definition a nootropic is any compound
[00:00:04] or supplement that can improve cognitive
[00:00:06] function here are some of the
[00:00:07] ingredients that I recommend and look
[00:00:09] for when choosing my nootropic stack at
[00:00:11] the top of my list Omega-3s it's a fatty
[00:00:13] acid found in the brain that has been
[00:00:14] linked with multiple brain health
[00:00:15] benefits things like sharper thinking
[00:00:18] faster reaction and improved memory
[00:00:20] second is phosphododlycerine it's a type
[00:00:22] of fat compound found in the brain that
[00:00:25] has been linked to improvements in
[00:00:26] thinking skills memory it also reduces
[00:00:29] age-related decline next after that
[00:00:31] let's talk about vitamin B specifically
[00:00:33] vitamin B6 B9 and b12 those three are
[00:00:37] often linked with brain health they can
[00:00:39] help break down homocysteine high levels
[00:00:41] of which have been associated with a
[00:00:43] greater risk of dementia and Alzheimer's
[00:00:45] disease cool now if you're curious about
[00:00:46] which nootropic blend I take I take this
[00:00:50] mind lab Pro you'll find that their
[00:00:51] ingredients are actually very natural
[00:00:53] safe and well backed by the research


=== Magician reveals fake memory trick! (ft. @WesBarker) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBae15YIzCs

[00:00:00] what's up everyone what's going on look
[00:00:01] at this guy interrupting my intro hey
[00:00:03] this is uh this is under 300 000 Subs
[00:00:05] get out of my office it's actually the
[00:00:07] perfect intro right there
[00:00:10] what's up everyone Nelson Dallas here
[00:00:12] five time USA memory champion and I am
[00:00:13] with zero time memory Champion over here
[00:00:16] that's right Wes Parker but magician
[00:00:18] extraordinaire
[00:00:19] [Music]
[00:00:32] thank you thank you for joining me
[00:00:34] you're welcome you're gonna show me a uh
[00:00:36] magic trick yeah I don't know much about
[00:00:37] it other than it's gonna kind of be
[00:00:40] Memory related yeah I'm gonna do the
[00:00:42] thing that you hate I'm gonna fake yes
[00:00:44] being good at memory okay yeah I hate it
[00:00:46] when I find people out there they're
[00:00:48] typically magicians who pretend to
[00:00:50] memorize uh but it's really just a magic
[00:00:53] trick but they believe or make you
[00:00:55] believe we want you to believe that it
[00:00:56] is pure memory when it's just magic
[00:00:58] what's your record time for memorizing a
[00:01:01] deck of cards uh personal and private is
[00:01:04] 29 seconds 29 seconds personal private
[00:01:06] okay now I'm a magician and as a
[00:01:08] magician you run into this all the time
[00:01:10] where you see magicians faking their
[00:01:12] ability to memorize decks of cards yeah
[00:01:15] I hate that yeah it's very annoying and
[00:01:17] uh and I could do that uh because once
[00:01:21] once I met you and and you're like oh
[00:01:23] you can learn how to memorize Dex cards
[00:01:24] ever I got really into it so did Chris
[00:01:26] okay uh so I go down to six minutes
[00:01:28] which was very nice okay I was like this
[00:01:30] is cool it's great yeah and then I'll
[00:01:32] never get fast enough to make it cool as
[00:01:34] magic and as a magician we can just find
[00:01:36] so many different ways to fake it sure
[00:01:37] right and as a magician it's just easier
[00:01:39] to fake it yeah with six minutes showing
[00:01:41] something is a lot of it's a lot of time
[00:01:43] so when you're doing that as a magician
[00:01:45] you're basically just memorizing a
[00:01:47] preset order in a deck okay and you do a
[00:01:49] bunch of false shuffles and pretend to
[00:01:51] mix it up but you don't but I don't even
[00:01:53] do that one to tell people I literally
[00:01:55] always have my deck in this exact order
[00:01:57] okay I shuffled it uh randomly one day
[00:02:00] so it looked nice and mixed and I just
[00:02:02] memorized it so now I always keep it in
[00:02:04] this one it's not like a famous stack
[00:02:06] it's like no it's less is stack pretty
[00:02:08] much and I even tell people this because
[00:02:09] they still have a hard time to believe
[00:02:10] that I wouldn't even bother so sometimes
[00:02:12] when I perform to someone I'll try and
[00:02:14] do the false shuffles and mix it up but
[00:02:15] for you I won't and this is actually so
[00:02:16] cool so if you take out a card right
[00:02:20] and remember it and show the camera
[00:02:24] now uh you can put it uh on top here
[00:02:27] yep
[00:02:29] okay uh you can you're gonna cut the
[00:02:31] deck like multiple times okay um you can
[00:02:34] do it in your hand but you're just gonna
[00:02:35] put the top to the bottom so you don't
[00:02:37] ever let anyone mix the cards but you
[00:02:38] let them cut it right so you can cut it
[00:02:40] and you gotta cut it again again and
[00:02:42] this is where some people like they kind
[00:02:44] of understand like when I say I know the
[00:02:45] order I know the order and you're not
[00:02:47] mixing up the order which is the best
[00:02:48] thing you're changing the start and stop
[00:02:50] point but that's really fun to people
[00:02:51] they don't understand that I would still
[00:02:52] understand how I could find this so when
[00:02:55] I do spread out the cards I can tell
[00:02:58] like very quickly your card 10 of
[00:03:01] diamonds
[00:03:02] that end up at the end but you could
[00:03:04] tell where it's missing and where it
[00:03:06] doesn't belong instantly that's amazing
[00:03:08] it is amazing and you guys can actually
[00:03:09] learn this so fast because I didn't do
[00:03:11] anything I said I did this is not a
[00:03:13] special stack it doesn't matter at all
[00:03:14] wait what do you mean this is not a
[00:03:16] stack this is nothing this is just a
[00:03:17] random deck of cards it's just a
[00:03:19] straight up magic trick Magic's so silly
[00:03:21] that even uh faking uh memorization and
[00:03:25] all that stuff I mean you don't even
[00:03:27] need to that sometimes can just be a
[00:03:30] plot line there's nothing to do with
[00:03:31] anything when I did this trick today
[00:03:33] just now yep I only need to know one
[00:03:35] card the bottom card okay so in this
[00:03:38] case I just look now I see the bottom
[00:03:39] cards the Ten of clubs yeah if you
[00:03:40] watched back what I just did a minute
[00:03:42] ago you'll see me do this and check the
[00:03:43] bottom card okay so all I'm thinking
[00:03:45] about is the Ten of clubs you take any
[00:03:46] card you want and you remember and and
[00:03:48] you remember it yeah and it goes on top
[00:03:51] of the deck every time you cut it the
[00:03:53] Ten of clubs right next to it okay right
[00:03:56] so when I spread it out obviously for
[00:03:57] the Ten of clubs and then just find the
[00:03:59] card that's right next to it and then
[00:04:01] you're gonna get that card every time
[00:04:02] yeah isn't that crazy that's not fair it
[00:04:04] is not fair so next time your your
[00:04:07] friends don't understand uh that that
[00:04:09] they might be bored by your uh if you
[00:04:11] take too long time to memorize this one
[00:04:13] just be like let me show you a magic
[00:04:15] trick and and it's entertaining and you
[00:04:18] know and you can and you could you could
[00:04:19] lie to them and you could say I memorize
[00:04:21] this right or not right because like you
[00:04:23] said there's there's weird ethics around
[00:04:24] it yeah or you do what I did uh be like
[00:04:27] tell them this whole story about how you
[00:04:29] memorize a stack of cards do the trick
[00:04:31] and then the big wow and then Shuffle it
[00:04:33] up and do it again and now you're really
[00:04:35] gonna and then wait and they'll be like
[00:04:38] I'm just kidding it's a magic trick yeah
[00:04:40] yeah okay okay I think it might be fun
[00:04:42] for instead of fighting uphill all the
[00:04:44] time with mentalism versus or mind
[00:04:46] reading and memory and versus magic
[00:04:48] I think it'd be fun go along with it
[00:04:50] just to have one in your pocket just
[00:04:52] just to
[00:04:55] Magic's fun man and I can pretend that
[00:04:57] memorizing you're really good take my 29
[00:05:00] seconds
[00:05:01] I'm gonna be like okay so choose a card
[00:05:03] yeah
[00:05:05] all right
[00:05:08] and then what do I turn on top yeah and
[00:05:11] then you can cut it as many times as you
[00:05:13] want yep
[00:05:15] it's so good that's I feel like that's
[00:05:17] what magic is Magic is always dumb yeah
[00:05:19] when you know this one you don't know it
[00:05:21] it's amazing when you know it you're
[00:05:22] just like oh
[00:05:24] now you do your fake looking around
[00:05:28] so this one other side oh it's the other
[00:05:31] side shoot yeah you gotta look to the
[00:05:32] right hey okay
[00:05:35] it's called a key card trick it is the
[00:05:37] number one beginner magic trick you'd
[00:05:38] ever learn but if you want to put a
[00:05:40] little flavor on the presentation and
[00:05:42] flavor it around something that you're
[00:05:43] interested in like I said it's funny to
[00:05:45] do because especially when you are a
[00:05:47] memory guy yeah right uh it's just so
[00:05:50] it's a way to make people sucker them in
[00:05:52] with something you already know how to
[00:05:53] do right because then you could be like
[00:05:54] listen that's a magic trick it actually
[00:05:56] takes me a minute to do this yeah and
[00:05:58] you can show them how you can really do
[00:05:59] it so by showing them a magic trick hey
[00:06:01] it's fun and then B now you get to
[00:06:03] backpedal and now show them the feet
[00:06:05] they're going to respect the feet so
[00:06:06] much more because you've already burnt
[00:06:08] the magic trick idea yeah that's still
[00:06:10] fun you've kind of lowered you've like
[00:06:11] made it more chill as well like yeah
[00:06:13] made it more of a less of a nerdy thing
[00:06:16] because there's some fun involved yeah
[00:06:18] and I feel like um you know whenever you
[00:06:19] watch like uh Olympics or uh NASCAR
[00:06:22] racing anything yeah you always like it
[00:06:25] more when you've tried it or have some
[00:06:27] more relationship to it you're like oh
[00:06:28] no that's harder than you think right or
[00:06:29] whatever and this is one of those things
[00:06:31] if you show them a magic trick and they
[00:06:32] and it still like it looks impressive
[00:06:34] because Imagine Dragons it and then you
[00:06:36] show them something real I think they're
[00:06:38] going to be like whoa that real thing is
[00:06:39] all of a sudden that much more
[00:06:41] interesting yeah so I don't know if that
[00:06:43] fits with you guys but I think it's very
[00:06:44] interesting instead of I don't know the
[00:06:46] only thing that bugs me is like I'm
[00:06:49] always like trying to find people who
[00:06:50] who cheat at memory and then I'm showing
[00:06:53] you how to do it
[00:06:54] that's as long as you do it respectfully
[00:06:56] right that's what are you just showing a
[00:06:58] magic trick yeah there you go yeah yeah
[00:06:59] that's one that's why I was like I
[00:07:00] wonder if nothing wrong we'll want to
[00:07:02] talk about this or not because yeah the
[00:07:05] thing is you're never I I don't ever
[00:07:08] recommend doing it without doing what I
[00:07:09] did which is just telling you I'm lying
[00:07:11] at the end to me that's the fun reveal
[00:07:13] yeah exactly to be like you believed all
[00:07:15] that are you kidding me this takes
[00:07:17] forever to do that's not possible and
[00:07:18] that was the moment in the trick where I
[00:07:20] was like oh wait what and then that made
[00:07:22] it up like a step more interesting yeah
[00:07:25] I mean it's uh it's literally one of my
[00:07:28] favorite things when you can see a
[00:07:29] magician uh not because we have the same
[00:07:32] problem magic as you do in memory okay
[00:07:33] is magicians some of them try and make
[00:07:36] it seem like it's real and that drives
[00:07:38] us other magicians it drives us insane
[00:07:41] we're like yeah this is not happening
[00:07:43] right I'll vanish the money land upside
[00:07:45] a a piece of fruit it's not real it's
[00:07:47] all a trick and I can't tell the
[00:07:49] audience enough how much it's all a
[00:07:51] trick right right and this is the exact
[00:07:52] same thing you could still do these

=== I DIDN'T WIN OR LOSE! (2022 USA Memory Championship RECAP) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eitu6uNEy-0

[00:00:00] a couple of weeks ago I went to the 2022
[00:00:02] USA memory Championship my first time as
[00:00:05] a spectator and not a competitor it was
[00:00:09] different what's up guys welcome to the
[00:00:12] USA memory championship in 2022 I am not
[00:00:15] competing this year but I will be
[00:00:16] involved in commentating kind of
[00:00:18] moderating the live stream we are here
[00:00:20] in Orlando at Full Sail University which
[00:00:22] is known for their media prowess we've
[00:00:25] got an awesome setup there's like a
[00:00:27] whole stage lights the whole shebang
[00:00:28] I've never seen anything quite like it
[00:00:30] I'm just going to document the day and
[00:00:31] kind of see how it goes let's go inside
[00:00:34] [Music]
[00:00:39] for those who don't know the USA memory
[00:00:42] Championship is an event that happens
[00:00:43] every year where people come together
[00:00:45] and memorize all sorts of useless stuff
[00:00:48] things like playing cards numbers poetry
[00:00:51] names and faces random facts about
[00:00:53] people long-term data the list goes on
[00:00:56] and essentially the winner is crowned
[00:00:58] after a full day of events memorizing as
[00:01:01] much as possible as accurately as
[00:01:03] possible and the founder of this company
[00:01:05] petition is this man right here Tony
[00:01:07] datino the founder of the USA memory
[00:01:11] Championship Tony Dozier and my goodness
[00:01:13] Tony datino showing people there's so
[00:01:16] much more they can do with their
[00:01:17] memories than they ever thought possible
[00:01:18] how many championships is this this is
[00:01:20] uh number 23. so we actually founded
[00:01:23] this in 1997. but uh covet shut us down
[00:01:26] for one year and uh snow shut us down
[00:01:29] for a second and so we're at 25 years of
[00:01:32] doing this but it's our 23rd event it's
[00:01:34] great to have you here thank you yeah
[00:01:36] whole different perspective though
[00:01:37] you're not gonna be sitting there being
[00:01:38] nervous and I feel a little bit like I'm
[00:01:40] missing out but it's okay well gee we
[00:01:42] can find the 13th spot for you
[00:01:45] foreign
[00:01:48] [Music]
[00:02:05] [Music]
[00:02:15] one of the things I think is most
[00:02:18] interesting about these championships is
[00:02:21] who competes what are the stories behind
[00:02:23] these people and what kind of people do
[00:02:24] you find at these championships are you
[00:02:26] gonna win today uh that's a plan no
[00:02:30] Liz has been training with me for the
[00:02:32] last six months so we'll see how he does
[00:02:33] he's good he's in good hands you might
[00:02:35] be shocked to learn that the people who
[00:02:37] show up are pretty regular people and
[00:02:39] quite varied in their backgrounds and
[00:02:42] age as well for example here we have
[00:02:44] orez who happened to be one of my
[00:02:46] students he's in his late 30s and Works
[00:02:48] on Wall Street I'm John Graham he's the
[00:02:50] former champion in 2018 he's a former
[00:02:53] substitute teacher and currently a
[00:02:55] memory and life coach and a father of
[00:02:57] Two And this is James he's an avid
[00:02:59] speedcuber an advantage card player and
[00:03:02] you can do this really cool thing where
[00:03:03] you can memorize a whole chessboard a
[00:03:05] deck of cards and a blind solve of a
[00:03:07] Rubik's Cube all at the same time what
[00:03:09] I'm Grace hello so this is Grace she's
[00:03:12] definitely a contender she's 19 years
[00:03:14] old and in college college but studying
[00:03:15] something that has nothing to do with
[00:03:16] memory I've been competing since I was
[00:03:19] 13. really yes I know that because I
[00:03:22] know your dad yes all the time I forget
[00:03:24] who I compete against but I remember
[00:03:25] your dad all the time yeah I'm super
[00:03:27] excited to be here you know it just goes
[00:03:29] to show that anybody can do this anybody
[00:03:32] can improve their memory it doesn't have
[00:03:33] to be some kind of geek who has no
[00:03:36] social skills and who just sits in front
[00:03:38] of their computer memorizing all day
[00:03:39] although that is what I do so this is
[00:03:42] going to be my seat my competition seat
[00:03:45] for the day I'll be uh doing some live
[00:03:48] announcing for the YouTube stream and
[00:03:49] some interviews so that's a different
[00:03:51] take but I'm excited to be a part of it
[00:03:53] anyways and hopefully make the
[00:03:55] experience for the viewer at home a
[00:03:57] little more interesting it's never been
[00:03:58] done before so exciting times
[00:04:02] so let's do a quick recap how did it all
[00:04:05] go down the first round which was words
[00:04:07] to remember had all 12 competitors go
[00:04:09] backstage and spend 15 minutes studying
[00:04:12] 200 words these are random words that
[00:04:14] are made up of nouns verbs adjectives
[00:04:16] All That Jazz they came back on stage I
[00:04:19] proceeded to go through the list one by
[00:04:21] one until three people had made two
[00:04:23] mistakes they got two strikes
[00:04:25] Russian and we'll go to word three
[00:04:28] ferret usually this event doesn't go
[00:04:30] much more than 50 or 60 words but this
[00:04:33] time it actually went really high it
[00:04:34] went to around 89 before the round was
[00:04:37] up I know a lot of people were sweating
[00:04:38] because they probably only memorized up
[00:04:40] to 100 just for strategy reasons so
[00:04:42] three competitors got knocked out here
[00:04:44] it went pretty well there was just one
[00:04:45] hiccup where Zachary actually said
[00:04:47] Eunice Circle instead of unicycle unit
[00:04:50] circle unicycle will get us there so
[00:04:52] that was a big mess on the part of the
[00:04:54] organizers but hey that's the way
[00:04:56] competitions go sometimes
[00:04:59] the next event was it's been a long time
[00:05:01] or in other words long-term memory the
[00:05:04] competitors had had one whole month to
[00:05:06] memorize 2 000 bits of random data well
[00:05:09] it wasn't random it was three chosen
[00:05:11] categories that the organizers had
[00:05:13] selected so each competitor got to turn
[00:05:15] to answer a random question from these
[00:05:16] three sets questions like what dates the
[00:05:19] Challenger Mission sts-61a fly October
[00:05:23] 30th 1985 to November 6 1985. damn and
[00:05:29] in this run we lost Grace Endeavor and
[00:05:32] it returned February 5th 2003. no ah I
[00:05:36] wanted her to win after the event I
[00:05:37] asked her what happened and this is her
[00:05:39] response because I didn't study can't
[00:05:41] win a memory competition if you don't
[00:05:42] study right yup for round three we had
[00:05:45] What's called the tea party which
[00:05:46] basically has five strangers come on
[00:05:49] video and say 12 random bits of data
[00:05:52] about themselves their name where
[00:05:53] they're from their favorite foods their
[00:05:55] favorite sports team all that stuff they
[00:05:57] say it live the competitors have to
[00:05:59] memorize it then they get a mind map of
[00:06:01] the same data which they can study for
[00:06:02] an extra five minutes I graduated in
[00:06:05] December 2021. try it residence
[00:06:07] Annapolis this event is hard they didn't
[00:06:10] even get through the first tea party
[00:06:11] guest which just shows you how difficult
[00:06:13] this was three competitors got knocked
[00:06:15] out orez my student unfortunately Jason
[00:06:17] and then Matt Wilson
[00:06:20] finally the last event double deck or
[00:06:23] bust they gotta memorize two full decks
[00:06:25] of cards in under five minutes John
[00:06:27] Graham ran away with this one he's an
[00:06:28] expert at cards and Tracy and James
[00:06:31] although I know that they can memorize
[00:06:32] lots of cards flubbed on the 20th card
[00:06:34] and the 26th card respectively six
[00:06:37] diamonds okay
[00:06:40] no six of Spades excellent four
[00:06:45] diamonds good
[00:06:47] ten of clubs okay five clubs all right
[00:06:52] we're gonna call it 26.
[00:06:59] six of hearts that is not correct we
[00:07:02] have ours Champion for the 23rd USA
[00:07:04] memory Champion that's it John Graham
[00:07:06] two-time winner 2018 and 2022. so his
[00:07:10] second time winning the championship
[00:07:12] round Applause my man great job John
[00:07:14] Graham two-time Champion now he joins
[00:07:16] the two-time champion Club so we got we
[00:07:19] got John Graham we got uh RAM Coley we
[00:07:22] got Ron White we got me we got Scott
[00:07:25] hagwood and we've got
[00:07:29] I think so there's six at least two-time
[00:07:32] Champions I know Scott Tatiana's won
[00:07:35] three times Scots won four and I've won
[00:07:38] five and there are three other two time
[00:07:39] Champions all right let's pause for a
[00:07:41] second because I think it's always
[00:07:42] customary in my recap videos to uh do a
[00:07:46] little reaction okay to some of the
[00:07:49] things that I said in my last video so
[00:07:52] let's do that
[00:07:54] did it I freaking did it I won the 2021
[00:07:58] USA memory championship
[00:08:00] [Music]
[00:08:02] my fifth title my fifth why would you
[00:08:05] say anything this is the trophy for the
[00:08:07] championship no it is not a bong and yes
[00:08:10] it is a sea horse another why is it a
[00:08:12] seahorse well because the hippocamp and
[00:08:14] yes they did have another seahorse this
[00:08:16] year what's become kind of a tradition
[00:08:18] is for me to kind of react to me
[00:08:22] reacting to me reacting reacting
[00:08:25] from previous memory Championship Recaps
[00:08:28] now I think this video is probably gonna
[00:08:30] be less interesting than the last two
[00:08:32] videos I did where I talked about losing
[00:08:34] again again and then before that losing
[00:08:36] again because now I won so I always find
[00:08:39] it more interesting when you lose than
[00:08:42] when you win but whatever at the very
[00:08:44] least this will be a recap of what
[00:08:46] happened at the 2021 USA memory
[00:08:48] Championship let's get started all right
[00:08:51] let's fast forward just a little bit so
[00:08:53] here we are again
[00:08:56] I lost again again and I lost again and
[00:09:00] again now I can say I won again again
[00:09:03] again again again again again and now I
[00:09:05] could say I
[00:09:07] didn't either cool all right didn't lose
[00:09:10] I didn't win nice
[00:09:13] and I won this time mind you with kids
[00:09:16] which you can hear crying in the yard
[00:09:19] and now I have even more kids
[00:09:22] my life duh
[00:09:25] yeah I feel like I just made this video
[00:09:27] but here I am making it again I don't
[00:09:30] feel like I just made this video this
[00:09:31] feels like a lifetime ago and it was
[00:09:33] only two years ago
[00:09:36] and yeah uh this actually feels like I
[00:09:39] just made this video so it's weird how
[00:09:41] time kind of feels different depending
[00:09:43] on the circumstances there I had lost
[00:09:45] I guess that maybe stretched the time a
[00:09:47] little bit this had won so it just felt
[00:09:50] like that flew by I wish I could have
[00:09:51] stayed the current champion for much
[00:09:53] longer but alas let's jump to the point
[00:09:55] where I talk about kind of how I feel so
[00:09:58] yeah the difference here is I actually
[00:10:00] did not know both decks down cold I was
[00:10:02] actually pretty rattled I don't know
[00:10:04] because I knew Lance was going to push
[00:10:05] me till the end it had just been me and
[00:10:07] the two high school students I would
[00:10:09] have felt like I had already won so yeah
[00:10:12] uh maybe this is my age and and you know
[00:10:15] just my skills declining
[00:10:18] it looked like here I didn't have both
[00:10:20] decks down cold I definitely didn't have
[00:10:22] both decks down cold here either but
[00:10:24] just goes to show you anybody who's
[00:10:26] interested in trying to win the USA
[00:10:27] championship
[00:10:29] you don't have to be perfect okay this
[00:10:31] is interesting because I've actually
[00:10:32] trained cards probably more than I did
[00:10:35] this year for whatever reason
[00:10:38] um and I remember last year having a
[00:10:39] little bit of an issue with that second
[00:10:41] deck even though I didn't need it but uh
[00:10:43] this year you know I think if I had been
[00:10:46] in the finals with John it's easy to say
[00:10:48] this because I wasn't there but um I
[00:10:50] felt very prepared and honestly a little
[00:10:53] more comfortable maybe it's because I
[00:10:54] didn't have to compete but I definitely
[00:10:56] felt like I would have put up a good
[00:10:57] fight against John had I been there I
[00:10:59] wish I had let's fast forward a little
[00:11:00] bit that might have been my last USA
[00:11:02] memory competition
[00:11:05] again I'm going to react to that that's
[00:11:07] funny because that little video in the
[00:11:09] bottom corner when did I shoot that that
[00:11:11] was in uh
[00:11:12] 2018 right and I was saying that was my
[00:11:14] last championship but 2021 was actually
[00:11:18] my last championship so the biggest
[00:11:21] Nelson here
[00:11:23] who was uncertain if he really was gonna
[00:11:25] not compete this year was correct
[00:11:29] here we go
[00:11:31] Ten Years Later from my first win and
[00:11:34] you know here I am I I've won again and
[00:11:37] 2009 was my first competition so 2013
[00:11:40] eight years later I'm still here
[00:11:42] although I think this is it I really do
[00:11:44] I say that now but I I really believe
[00:11:47] five is was the number I was looking for
[00:11:49] I got it I don't know
[00:11:51] five still feels really good I don't
[00:11:54] really have a need to add a six in front
[00:11:56] of it it almost feels a bit stupid and
[00:11:58] unnecessary so five still feels good I'm
[00:12:01] happy about that else to prove I know I
[00:12:03] told John that I'd like to compete
[00:12:05] against him in the finals but
[00:12:07] it's true I still would I I said I would
[00:12:09] have loved to have been there in the
[00:12:10] finals with him
[00:12:11] but you know there's also something
[00:12:14] really nice about having hung up my
[00:12:16] cleats on a win we just gotta persevere
[00:12:18] and stick to the goddamn thing you want
[00:12:21] to get done
[00:12:22] God damn it God damn just stick to it
[00:12:25] honestly that that's what I said in a
[00:12:27] couple of videos ago when we want to
[00:12:28] talk about happiness and and fulfillment
[00:12:30] it's sticking to I can almost feel it's
[00:12:34] palpable just how excited and
[00:12:38] satisfied I was with my
[00:12:40] performance and winning that
[00:12:42] championship and I still feel that way
[00:12:44] you know I think back on it was a year
[00:12:46] ago I think back on it and
[00:12:49] you know from that perspective now it
[00:12:51] still feels like I'm So Satisfied by it
[00:12:53] very proud of myself back then
[00:12:56] um that's not gonna change
[00:12:58] um and even when I think about competing
[00:13:00] again I kind of stop myself because I'm
[00:13:02] like no you had the best way to close it
[00:13:05] out that that feeling
[00:13:08] if you if you'll never really get that
[00:13:10] again you know maybe I don't even think
[00:13:12] if I win again I'd get that again and if
[00:13:14] I lose I definitely won't get that again
[00:13:16] a little sour that feeling that I had
[00:13:18] that memory of that feeling but on the
[00:13:21] flip side I definitely felt like
[00:13:25] man I miss this feeling I miss this
[00:13:28] feeling I want that feeling again
[00:13:32] and obviously I can only get that from
[00:13:33] winning right that's not true I can get
[00:13:36] it elsewhere I just need to find another
[00:13:37] place to find it but I know where I can
[00:13:39] find it and it's by winning this
[00:13:41] Championship again right uh that's the
[00:13:43] tempting size of it right because here I
[00:13:45] am
[00:13:46] are getting chills when I talk about
[00:13:48] this but oh I got chills just hearing
[00:13:50] myself say that because it's just a good
[00:13:52] reminder I haven't watched this video
[00:13:53] since last year so actually seeing it
[00:13:55] again is is pretty fun to see Nelson
[00:13:58] right there late 2021 he looks well
[00:14:01] rested I must say pretty these
[00:14:03] days he's got he's got more sleep than I
[00:14:06] am right now all right let's stop there
[00:14:07] we don't have to go too much further
[00:14:09] into this you guys have seen that
[00:14:11] reaction many times over yeah
[00:14:15] that's all I got to say see in the next
[00:14:16] video I'm out that's awesome you did a
[00:14:19] great job nice two tall guys I must let
[00:14:22] myself do with Heights
[00:14:25] the more the hippocampus grows okay

=== This is a 3D-PRINT of my OWN BRAIN!! 😲 #Shorts ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psZEDqSVqAk

[00:00:00] this is a 3D print of my brain like my
[00:00:02] actual brain is the actual size right
[00:00:04] obviously not blue but the actual size
[00:00:06] so a number of years ago I was asked to
[00:00:08] sit in an fmri machine for some research
[00:00:10] and they had so much data that they
[00:00:12] could actually construct this 3D print
[00:00:14] of my brain and even see the inside here
[00:00:16] I mean it's not super detailed but you
[00:00:17] can see the corpus callosum right here
[00:00:19] that's the thing that actually allows
[00:00:20] the two hemispheres of the brain to
[00:00:22] communicate here's a quick lesson about
[00:00:23] the parts of the brain here you have the
[00:00:25] frontal lobe the parietal lobe the
[00:00:27] occipital lobe the temporal lobe the
[00:00:29] frontal lobe has to do with decision
[00:00:31] making your personality and movement the
[00:00:33] parietal lobe has to do with spatial
[00:00:36] information and identifying objects the
[00:00:38] occipital lobe has to do entirely with
[00:00:40] vision and then the temporal lobe here
[00:00:42] has to do with memory and speech now if
[00:00:44] you could but you can't because this is
[00:00:46] kind of where the detail isn't so
[00:00:48] perfect but my hippocampus would be
[00:00:50] right here and that is a part of the
[00:00:51] temporal lobe that deals with memory

=== the FASTEST reader in the WORLD?? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G80nU5y7-UA

[00:00:00] Alright, so first things first, you guys gotta stop sending me this video.
[00:00:04] Yes, go on.
[00:00:06] bleferglerlrlgelffeledfedelledeldle
[00:00:08] Everyone on every social media platform that I have, all my friends, even people
[00:00:13] I don't know, have been sending me a memed version of this video. And unfortunately, I'm not
[00:00:18] sure if if most people know if this is real or not, but I'm going to say it right here:
[00:00:22] It is not real. This is NOT the fastest reader in the world. It's just a skit.
[00:00:27] Anyways, I wanted to react to it because it felt very appropriate. I
[00:00:32] felt some kind of duty to react to a video like this. It's
[00:00:36] hilarious and it's a good commentary on things that are relevant to
[00:00:41] my channel, if you know what I mean. So we're going to watch the full video right here.
[00:00:46] I'm going to react to it. This is from a comedian on YouTube, josh2funny
[00:00:51] I believe he or they, I don't know if it's a group of them or just the guy from
[00:00:56] Nigeria. I love their humor. I've watched a few of their other videos now because of this one, and you
[00:01:01] should check them out. I'll leave a link to their channel in the description, and you can enjoy that
[00:01:05] there. Let's dive in.
[00:01:18] Ebenezer the fast reader, haha.
[00:01:20] Next!
[00:01:21] So I guess the premise here is that it's an audition. Yeah, it's a talent show kind of thing. And
[00:01:26] this guy is supposedly, the fastest reader in the world.
[00:01:31] Hello?
[00:01:32] Hi.
[00:01:34] How we know you?
[00:01:37] Ebenezer.
[00:01:38] Oh bei?
[00:01:40] I'm Ebenezer. The reader.
[00:01:43] I'm the fastest reader in the world.
[00:01:44] Ebenezer. The fastest reader.
[00:01:45] First off the bat, that's hilarious. And I love how
[00:01:48] deadpan and these guys are just like very
[00:01:53] silent. A lot of like, empty room in this comedy. I love it.
[00:01:56] You...Who...How did you come about that conclusion?
[00:02:00] I read 1679 pages
[00:02:05] book within 2 seconds.
[00:02:10] Wow. You did what? ... WOW.
[00:02:13] I FINISHED...
[00:02:14] It will shock you to know that I finished reading
[00:02:18] 1679 pages book in
[00:02:23] 2 seconds. Yes. 2 seconds.
[00:02:27] 2 seconds. Yes.
[00:02:29] That's why I've crowned myself the
[00:02:33] fastest reader in the world.
[00:02:35] Okay, so first of all, 1679 Pages in 2 seconds, right? Just
[00:02:40] picture that for a second. Impossible to read and comprehend
[00:02:44] that. But I love that he actually chose a number and he stuck with that number.
[00:02:49] He threw out a big number. I was wondering if you would actually remember that number. And he did.
[00:02:53] He brings up a good
[00:02:54] point because he's saying, even though it's a joke, that he
[00:02:59] crowned himself the fastest reader. Because why not, right?
[00:03:04] Who is going to really judge that, right? You read a book in this many minutes,
[00:03:09] this many seconds. Okay, tell me about it. But at the same
[00:03:14] time, it's like, who's really going to question that? You know, even if...especially if it's a
[00:03:19] book that you've never heard of or never read. Like, how would you verify that, right? Other than
[00:03:24] maybe asking them what they know about it? But if they looked up a summary somewhere, maybe they
[00:03:29] could tell you that, right? They've looked that up. I don't know.
[00:03:31] According to Google Guinness World Record, the fastest reader, I think, read
[00:03:36] 83 pages in 1 minute. And to see this, I mean,
[00:03:40] Guinness would have to... And yeah, I think
[00:03:42] that's actually a true record. I'd have to look it up to see who
[00:03:47] actually holds that record. But I like that they threw in some facts here that are real.
[00:03:51] If you pass this stage, though.
[00:03:53] Yeah, they need to. They've not met me.
[00:03:55] Why?
[00:03:56] Because I'm not taking my talents out there. I'm just still doing it based on
[00:04:01] the passion of this.
[00:04:02] So you're doing it for passion?
[00:04:04] Yes.
[00:04:05] Do you know what 2 seconds is? That's 1 and then 2.
[00:04:09] Yeah.
[00:04:09] And you read what again?
[00:04:13] 1679 pages.
[00:04:16] 1000.
[00:04:18] Let's go to the chase. How many pages would you be reading here today? Okay.
[00:04:23] I have this book. 'A Successful Content Creator's Guide.' It's a short book. I'm going to read it
[00:04:28] in a twinkle of an eye.
[00:04:31] A twinkle of an eye.
[00:04:33] All right.
[00:04:33] Everything, I'm going to read everything. So, do you have a copy of the book that we can hold onto...
[00:04:38] A measurable out of time...
[00:04:38] I'm actually reading it. Let's have a copy of the book.
[00:04:41] I see what you guys did there.
[00:04:42] We didn't do anything.
[00:04:43] It's very good for content creators. I think you should read it when you get home.
[00:04:47] But don't read it now.
[00:04:49] Don't read with me. You can't read with me. I'm fast.
[00:04:52] He's fast.
[00:04:54] I love this. It's so like awkward, but it's perfect.
[00:04:58] Alright. Shall we? Yes, the floor is yours. LET'S GO.
[00:05:02] Hold on, let me open the page.
[00:05:06] So you read, in what?
[00:05:07] In 2 seconds, you said.
[00:05:08] He said a twinkle of an eye.
[00:05:09] Twinkle of an eye.
[00:05:10] Alright twinkle it. So now, within 1 second, I'm going to finish all this.
[00:05:17] All these books? Yeah.
[00:05:19] Alright, I'm watching.
[00:05:25] Here we go.
[00:05:26] Yes, go on.
[00:05:28] bleferglerlrlgelffeledfedelledeldle
[00:05:30] sblefergeldelgelrlgeleldewhatoidsbleferd
[00:05:33] sblloobaloobaderbaladoobablerfblahderf
[00:05:38] sblckadackadooasdlksallergealdleerlalerlaff
[00:05:43] What is it? It was fast, so you didn't....
[00:05:45] What is it? 
[00:05:46] What just happened now? What, what did I just. What does. What, what.
[00:05:50] What was this? WHAT IS THIS NOW??
[00:05:54] What is bleadfreldelerelae?
[00:05:55] What did you just do?
[00:05:56] You know what's great is...you know, this is a joke,
[00:06:01] obviously, but he's obviously been inspired
[00:06:06] by some demonstrations of speed-reading he's seen online, and they are
[00:06:11] similar to this. And I wish those demonstrations had been in front of
[00:06:15] such real judges. This is how somebody would really react. It's like, what
[00:06:20] the hell was that? What is this? WHAT IS THIS? Unfortunately, that
[00:06:25] wasn't the case. So I like that it's kind of...it's kind of like a 
[00:06:28] social commentary on that video.
[00:06:31] You want to tell me you've just finished reading all those books?
[00:06:33] Yeah, because I'm fast.
[00:06:34] I'm still holding in front of my page. Okay, so what is it, this one?
[00:06:39] 'A Successful Content or Skit Creator Guide.' What does it say?
[00:06:43] Introduction. What is the first thing there?
[00:06:46] Summarize the book. Are you stupid? What are you doing?
[00:06:48] What did you learn from the book that you just read?
[00:06:51] Read it out. Let me hear you.
[00:06:55] flevlaa...
[00:06:57] You said what?
[00:06:59] The first one is fleasdalasdlasdaeref.
[00:07:01] He's what? Fleevedeevee?
[00:07:03] So what is fleevedeevee mean? Is there written fleevedeevee in this book?
[00:07:07] It brings up a good point. Right? So it sounds like one guy was saying
[00:07:11] summarize it. Right. The other guy is saying: Tell me what's on the first page basically.
[00:07:16] In other words, what did you memorize? Right? And there's a big difference
[00:07:21] between memorizing a book and just reading a book and understanding the gist of it.
[00:07:26] So not fair questions on both, but still pretty funny, right? I like how he's saying that there's actually
[00:07:31] bleebedeebe in the book. And he's like, Where is the bleebedeebe in the book?
[00:07:36] What does that mean?
[00:07:37] Let me see.
[00:07:38] EH EH EH! I will bite your ear!
[00:07:41] Don't touch it. I WILL CHEW YOUR MEAT! Are you crazy?
[00:07:45] Summarize this book! Oh ya.
[00:07:51] I was fast. I was...I just read...
[00:07:55] I can read fast.
[00:07:56] You read, you don't assimilate, you don't understand what you are reading.
[00:07:59] There was the point. And that's it right there. Right? You read it fast, but you don't
[00:08:04] assimilate you don't understand what you read. So what is the point? And that's
[00:08:09] comedy here. But that is such a great point. When reading fast, you talk
[00:08:14] about speed-reading. I have a speed-reading video. I talk about it, but it's like there
[00:08:19] are times when you want to read faster. There are times when you want to read slower. But there's no point in reading
[00:08:24] fast, fast, fast if you're not going to retain anything.
[00:08:29] And you get to decide what level you want to retain and you can adjust your speed
[00:08:34] accordingly. But like, if you don't know anything from what you read, then what's the point?
[00:08:39] What a great take home message, guys. Thank you. Yes.
[00:08:41] How can you be reading what is not going in you? Anybody can do what you just did.
[00:08:47] Yes. So now, what..what kind of talent is this?
[00:08:51] Judge yourself.
[00:08:54] I saw somebody do it on the Internet. And I said, ah okay, this is nice...
[00:08:57] He said he saw somebody do that on the Internet. We know exactly who he's talking about here. And I
[00:09:02] love that there is now a comedy skit because of that. I probably should have
[00:09:07] tried to do something like that, too, but here we go. I love that these guys did that.
[00:09:12] I feel you and that person is stupid. Yes. Because
[00:09:17] there's no way you will carry a book and do freeveedjeefreeveedje and that's it. And you are telling
[00:09:22] me you are not okay for any reason?
[00:09:27] Yes. Because you come, you come, you come...
[00:09:30] YAHHHHHH...YAHHHHH!!
[00:09:36] Well, there you go. That was a great video. In case you see that or you see the part
[00:09:41] where he just does the fluveeduhfluv part and there's a meme involved and it's just that clip.
[00:09:46] It is not real, okay?
[00:09:48] He is not...Well, I guess he is the fastest reader, but he
[00:09:51] doesn't remember anything, right?
[00:09:53] But I love that. It needed to be done.
[00:09:57] You know, even past just speed-reading, you know, it's easy to put
[00:10:02] information out on the web and have it be exaggerated
[00:10:06] and untested. If I try to do a memory demonstration, I try to at least
[00:10:11] provide uncut versions of it so it looks as legit as possible.
[00:10:16] Is it perfect? No, it's never going to be perfect because it's on video. But you try your best to put
[00:10:21] information out there that people can at least try to verify themselves.
[00:10:25] But hilarious, they did another video about contortionists, about magicians.
[00:10:30] I hope they do one about mnemonists, but we'll see.
[00:10:33] Thanks, Josh2Funny for making that video.
[00:10:35] Go to their channel, check out the video, subscribe to them, give them some love and then come back
[00:10:40] to mine. And subscribe to mine if you haven't done so already.
[00:10:43] Anyways, thanks for watching, guys. I'll see you in the next one.
[00:10:45] I'm out!

=== ALL the BRITISH KINGS & QUEENS 👑 (the FASTEST way to MEMORIZE them) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw0LhoeY7P4

[00:00:01] This is my wife, Leah. And there's one thing that she loves more
[00:00:06] than anything else in the world.
[00:00:08] Peanut butter banana sandwiches?
[00:00:10] No. The royal family! Oh, I do. I do. In light of recent events,
[00:00:15] I decided that it might be fun to teach her how to memorize all the
[00:00:19] kings and queens in British history. Would that be cool to know? Would you like to
[00:00:24] know that?
[00:00:26] Okay.
[00:00:32] When I was a little boy and I was going to the school called Eten End, which was the Pre-K
[00:00:37] for Eton, I don't know if I would have ended up there, but I like to think that I would have
[00:00:42] wearing top hats and coat tails. Back then we had to memorize
[00:00:46] a poem, very famous poem in England that gives you almost all of
[00:00:51] the kings and queens in history. Here's the poem. I'm going to read it to you. It's quite fun. Willy,
[00:00:56] Willy, Harry, Stee, Harry, Dick, John, Harry 3. 1, 2, 3 Neds,
[00:01:01] Richard two. Henry four, five, six, then who? Edward, four, five, Dick
[00:01:06] the bad, Harrys twain and Ned the lad. Mary, Bessie, James the vain,
[00:01:11] Charlie, Charlie, James again. William and Mary, Anne Gloria. Four
[00:01:15] Georges, William and Victoria. Edward, George, repeat the twain. Liz
[00:01:20] the second, Charles again. Now this was slightly updated recently. Obviously that last
[00:01:25] line used to not have any mention of Charles, but now it does. Does this give you all the history?
[00:01:30] No, but it's a quick mnemonic verse to get in your head. All of these kings and
[00:01:35] queens through a fun, easy rhyme. Now, I must say that stuff like this is actually
[00:01:40] a really good way to memorize something. What I mean by that is something that is in the form of a song
[00:01:45] or a rhyme or a rap. My money don't jiggle jiggle. It's a really quick catchy
[00:01:49] way to get something into your memory for the long term, especially if you can put it to music.
[00:01:54] That's kind of the key spot. Now, for this video, I actually really wanted to write some music to perform
[00:01:59] this for you, but I'm not that good of a musician anymore. At least
[00:02:04] I definitely can't sing. Now, my wife is pretty much an expert when it
[00:02:09] comes to how memory techniques work. Does she use them? Not really, but she has a pretty
[00:02:14] darn good natural memory, so I'll allow it. Let's let her finish this beautiful
[00:02:18] bite. Okay. Anyways, the first step was to get her to
[00:02:23] read the dang thing aloud just so she could get acquainted with it. But she had some questions.
[00:02:28] These are the royal people?
[00:02:29] Yeah, most of them are nicknames.
[00:02:34] Who is Steve?
[00:02:35] Now, just so you know, Steve is short for Steven, Willy is short for William,
[00:02:40] Harry is Henry, Ned is Edward, Bessie is Elizabeth, and
[00:02:44] Twain means two or twice.
[00:02:51] He split Robin's arrow in twain!
[00:02:52] Also, it goes without saying that Dick is Richard. And yeah, there's this whole story about Dick
[00:02:57] the bad. Of course, trust me, there's tons of history hidden between the lines of
[00:03:01] this poem. Not going to go into it all now, but it's definitely worth looking into because it's fascinating. Game of Thrones
[00:03:06] style shit. Just absolutely bonkers. I highly suggest checking out 'CGP gray's'
[00:03:11] video of a brief history of the royal family. It's PFFFFFFFFFF. Mind my
[00:03:16] English....!@#$ing Mental.
[00:03:18] Willy, Willy, Harry, Stee...
[00:03:21] So she read the poem to herself, out loud, carefully and fully attentive.
[00:03:26] That's super important. If you're not present while doing this, then what's the point? And here's a pro tip. As you
[00:03:31] read it, really try to visualize and feel what is being said through the
[00:03:36] poem. Don't just read the words on the page. Make it come alive in your mind and or
[00:03:41] take note of anything interesting that pops out at you as you read it.
[00:03:44] They're doing that Kanye thing where it's like, it rhymes, but it doesn't rhyme. But it's going to make you think it rhymes
[00:03:49] next.
[00:03:50] Once she had read the poem, I made her write out all of the first letters of each
[00:03:54] word, including capitalization and punctuation. There's this sort of memory magic that
[00:03:59] happens when you do this. I can't explain it. I go into this technique a lot more in one of my other
[00:04:04] videos. Link in the description. All right. So now that you have it written down, the next thing is to
[00:04:09] read this as best as you can without looking at this, just by seeing the first letters.
[00:04:14] Just try it. If you have to peek, you have to peek. But just try to do it without.
[00:04:18] Willy, Willie, Harry,
[00:04:22] Steve.
[00:04:23] Now, once you have the first letters of every word, the next step is to read from
[00:04:28] that transcription and see if you can get all the words. Now, your brain will struggle a little bit to
[00:04:33] kind of find the words that represented these single letters. But it can do it really well,
[00:04:38] surprisingly well, better than you think. Because imagine you're reading a poem and then suddenly
[00:04:43] you can only see the first letter. That's significantly less information than the whole poem, right? But
[00:04:48] magically, your brain can do it. And I think when you go through the process of writing down the letters beforehand,
[00:04:53] you're subconsciously actually recording some of the information in your memory.
[00:04:57] Anne Gloria, four Georges, William, and
[00:05:02] Victoria.
[00:05:03] So you can see here she's struggling a little bit. She's slowly kind of figuring it out. But that's part of the
[00:05:08] process. And that's really where the powerful memory stickiness
[00:05:13] happens. All right. So in most cases, if it's short enough, you could probably do that a couple of times
[00:05:18] and then try it without. And usually it'll be there. But I would suggest supplementing with memory
[00:05:22] palettes. So we're actually going to put each line an image for what it is on a location
[00:05:27] here in this room. Now, I've done a couple of videos on how to memorize lines really quickly
[00:05:32] and text pretty quickly. And in one I did this funny, kind of
[00:05:37] interesting technique where you write the first letter of the first word of each line.
[00:05:42] And then in another video, I did one where you actually used a memory palace. Now, the technique where you write the
[00:05:47] first letter is really good for kind of short, varying
[00:05:52] lines. Things that read as kind of text, I think is best for
[00:05:57] a poem like this, where it's just a bunch of names and silly
[00:06:01] rhymes and it's a big paragraph and a lot of repeats.
[00:06:06] I think the technique might not work as well. So I think the way I'm going to approach
[00:06:11] it is to do a combination to have her start by doing the method where you write the first letter but then also
[00:06:16] supplementing it with a memory palace. And I think those two combined will actually get it in her
[00:06:21] brain pretty solidly and quickly. If you don't know what a memory palace is, it's basically a way
[00:06:26] to store images of what you're trying to memorize and placing them on real life locations so
[00:06:31] that when you try to remember it, you can mentally think of those places and it'll remind you of the line. So since
[00:06:35] we're in this living room area, I decided to choose some locations that were near us. We could
[00:06:40] do the lamp, the camera stand there, this part of the sofa, this part of the
[00:06:45] sofa. Your lap, that part of the sofa. The ottoman over there, the
[00:06:49] fireplace, the TV, that stand. And then maybe the center of the carpet.
[00:06:53] I'm not going to remember this.
[00:06:55] It's just a little loop.
[00:06:56] All right.
[00:06:57] What comes next is usually the weirdest part of the whole process because it involves coming up with an
[00:07:01] improvising, some really bizarre imagery that's kind of outlandish sexual over the
[00:07:06] top that will just help you remember the thing it is that you're trying to remember. We got a lot of Willys. We're going
[00:07:11] to think of some willys. We got a lot of Dicks. We could think of a lot of dicks. No wonder this was a
[00:07:16] popular schoolboy thing to memorize because it was just like a chance for us to
[00:07:20] say naughty words. And on top of that, we're taking these funny images and we're imagining
[00:07:25] them on the locations of our memory palace. So, like, on the lampshade, on
[00:07:30] the ottoman, on the TV, and so on. And Charles again. All right,
[00:07:35] that wraps it up.
[00:07:36] I'm so nervous though...
[00:07:37] Can she get them all? Okay, on the lamp...
[00:07:40] Okay. Willie. Willie. Harry. Steve. Harry. Dick. John. Harry 3.
[00:07:44] 1, 2,3, Ned, Richard two.
[00:07:48] Harry 4, 5, 6, then who? Edward
[00:07:53] 4, 5, Dick the bad. Harrys twain, and Ned the lad. Mary, Bessie,
[00:07:58] James the vain. Charlie, Charlie, James again. William and
[00:08:03] Mary, Anne Gloria.
[00:08:08] Four Georges, William and Victoria.
[00:08:14] Edward, George. Repeat the twain. Liz the second. Charles
[00:08:18] again. This is my tinks moment, so let me have
[00:08:23] it. Who is tinks?
[00:08:25] Thanks for watching, guys. I hope that was insightful.
[00:08:28] Watching that was pretty cool.
[00:08:29] A live teaching of how to apply techniques to something
[00:08:34] that is a bit tricky to memorize. You could do it the rote
[00:08:39] repetitious way, but that's going to take some time. This is a little quicker.
[00:08:44] And can work on anybody. Not just a memory champion.
[00:08:47] Brilliant, fabulous, fun wives.
[00:08:51] Yeah. Especially when you're trying to memorize something that's like a lot of similar names that aren't.
[00:08:55] Except for Steve.
[00:08:57] Steve. Steven.
[00:08:58] Steven.
[00:08:59] His original name.
[00:09:00] Steven was a frat bro that probably was the stephen had a pop collar.
[00:09:05] That was like uh... and a super powdered wig... Probably was a
[00:09:10] really cool looking guy.
[00:09:11] No, I bet Steve had bad teeth. Was mean to people.
[00:09:15] I'm going to post a picture of him right here. Insert it right here and just pretend like we're reacting because I don't know what he looks like. Oh,
[00:09:20] what a good looking guy. Thank you guys for watching. Please like and subscribe. Any
[00:09:25] last words?
[00:09:26] No. Princess Diana should have been in there.
[00:09:29] She's not.


=== Memorizing flags 🇮🇳 🇧🇷 🇹🇿 🇮🇹 vs. WORLD MEMORY CHAMP ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7FmKwTJC5Q

[00:00:00] three two one go this is andrea mutzi
[00:00:02] and he's a world memory champion and i
[00:00:04] decided to take him up on a challenge to
[00:00:06] memorize flags as fast as possible it
[00:00:08] started with me being bored out of my
[00:00:09] mind on the couch and then it led to me
[00:00:11] memorizing 197 different flags from all
[00:00:14] over the world yeah 197 took me about 30
[00:00:16] minutes to memorize them all and then a
[00:00:18] couple of reviews after that to get it
[00:00:20] down perfect here are some examples for
[00:00:22] burundi i pictured in the center of all
[00:00:23] those three stars a bear in his undies
[00:00:26] comoros i imagine that there was a comb
[00:00:28] in the place of the moon and the stars
[00:00:30] scraping from left to right for djibouti
[00:00:32] right where the three colors meet i
[00:00:33] imagine a big old booty bouncing up and
[00:00:35] down
[00:00:36] you get the idea next it was time to go
[00:00:38] up against andrea here's what happened
[00:00:40] yemen south africa
[00:00:42] afghanistan angola yeah he just kicked
[00:00:44] my ass although i did get all of mine
[00:00:46] right lesotho latvia libya morocco
[00:00:48] anyway so get off your djibouti comoros
[00:00:51] your hair and try learning these flags
[00:00:53] yourself give it a shot oh and don't
[00:00:55] forget your bare undies


=== Memorizing ALL the FLAGS of the WORLD in 1 HOUR ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTnBsdFGN7M

[00:00:01] So there I was, just
being super productive,
[00:00:03] when all of a
sudden, this Italian dude
[00:00:06] shows up on my feed.
[00:00:08] He's memorized all the country flags
[00:00:11] in the entire world
in under 2 hours.
[00:00:14]  But all I kept
thinking about was...
[00:00:19] I can do the same
thing in 1 hour.
[00:00:32] So first we got to figure out
how many flags there are.
[00:00:34] How many are we learning?
According to the Internet,
[00:00:37] this number varies depending
on who recognizes what,
[00:00:39] whether it's sovereign state,
whatever. But I'm going to go by
[00:00:42] what the US recognizes as a country.
[00:00:44] So that's 195 different flags.
[00:00:47] Maybe I'll add a couple more at the end.
Who knows?
[00:00:49] But let's start with 195.
[00:00:56] All right. One of the first things
we got to do is actually
[00:00:58] see which flags I
already know.
[00:01:01] Do I really need to memorize 195 flags?
Probably not.
[00:01:05] I feel like I probably have already
a sizable handful of flags,
[00:01:10] just that I know from
knowing things in my life.
[00:01:13]  And that's always kind of the first thing
you got to do when you're trying
[00:01:15] to memorize them or you have a challenge,
[00:01:17] is to actually target
what are the things that
[00:01:20] I need to commit to memory?
[00:01:22] Because if there's
stuff that I already know
[00:01:23]  that can be
logically deduced
[00:01:25] from other things that I already know,
[00:01:26] I don't need to memorize this stuff,
so why waste my time?
[00:01:28] Step number one to
memorizing anything
[00:01:30] is figuring out what you
actually have to memorize.
[00:01:32] So if you're going
to do this challenge with me
[00:01:34] which I
encourage you to do so,
[00:01:35] figure out which ones
you already know,
[00:01:37] test yourself, and then target the ones
and say, okay,
[00:01:39] is what I actually have to memorize,
[00:01:41] and then memorize that.
[00:01:42]  So let's figure that out.
Let's see how many I
[00:01:44] actually know.
[00:01:45]  It might be less than I think I do,
[00:01:47]  but we got to try it and figure it out.
[00:01:49] Let's go.
[00:02:00] All right, so first thing we're
gonna do
[00:02:02] is a little test here.
[00:02:04] So...
[00:02:05] let's get that going.
[00:02:07] Flags of the world here..
Okay there's 197 in here.
[00:02:10] So whatever this
is, just to kind of
[00:02:13] get a general idea
of how much I know.
[00:02:15] This is 18 minutes timer.
[00:02:17] Okay. Don't know..
[00:02:25] Iraq. Frick damn.
[00:02:28] Finland.
[00:02:30] That was the one I saw
just moments ago.
[00:02:32] The red white ones are tough because..
[00:02:34] this one is Kuwait.
[00:02:37] Ukraine only know that
because of recent events.
[00:02:40] Libya. This one is a soccer team
and I know his place.
[00:02:45] I've seen this one.
[00:02:49] This one is either Iraq
[00:02:52]  that was just against so many
 African countries that-
[00:02:56] I definitely thought I knew more
than I'm actually getting
[00:03:00] All right, so 62 out of 195-97
[00:03:04] whatever you want to call it,
that's not bad, right?
[00:03:07] What is that? I know about 30%.
[00:03:09] So  really, I need to know,
like, 135-ish flags,
[00:03:13] not 195. 97.
[00:03:15] Cool. So now that I know
that there's 60 or so that I already know,
[00:03:18] That's 60 that I
don't even have to look at.
[00:03:20] All right, so I guess now
let's actually try to memorize them.
[00:03:23] I'm going to try to do this in an hour.
Less than an hour,
[00:03:36] By the way, I wanted
to take a moment to say
[00:03:38] that this video is
sponsored by Mind Lab Pro.
[00:03:41] You've probably heard me
talk about them before.
[00:03:43]  I've been working with them
for the last year,
[00:03:45] and I will be for the foreseeable future.
[00:03:46] Why? Because I can't live
without this supplement.
[00:03:49] This is the best, in my opinion.
[00:03:51] All in one nootropic blend. \
[00:03:53] There's a lot of nootropics out there.
[00:03:55] Some have ingredients
that aren't that great for you.
[00:03:57] This one- all the ingredients
are well researched.
[00:03:59] Safe, and best of all-
[00:04:01] actually help your brain.
[00:04:02] So if you need a little
mental boost in your life,
[00:04:05] techniques are the way to go.
[00:04:06] But if you need a little bit
 extra of an edge,
[00:04:09] I would suggest taking a nootropic.
[00:04:11] And if you were going
to take a no tropic, I
[00:04:12] would suggest taking
this one or trying it out.
[00:04:15] Give it a try. Link is
in the description.
[00:04:17] Now let's get back to memorizing
some flags. Yeah, okay.
[00:04:20] All right, guys, I found this website.
[00:04:22] It's called World Atlas.
[00:04:23] It's really nice. You should check it out.
[00:04:25] It's got all the flags here.
[00:04:26] and it says, okay,
here are the countries.
[00:04:27] There's 193 of them.
[00:04:30] And then the two extra ones.
[00:04:31] Yeah, the UN observed
states Palestine and Vatican.
[00:04:35] then there's a bunch of whole
dependent territories.
[00:04:37] There's a bunch of those.
[00:04:38] 30 more.
I'm not gonna do those.
[00:04:40] at least for now.
[00:04:41]  So I got all the countries I need here,
plus I got all their facts.
[00:04:44] Really nice website.
[00:04:45] And I'm going to
set a timer here,
[00:04:47] and I'm going to
time lapse this so
[00:04:49] you don't get bored.
[00:05:14] All right, 16 minutes.
Now I'm going to do a review.
[00:05:18]  That's how I typically will do
long term
[00:05:20] kind of big content here is
I'll kind of do my Mnemonics,
[00:05:24] go through it, and then
I'll do a review at higher speed,
[00:05:28] and that usually solidifies.
[00:05:29] I'd say 95% of everything,
[00:05:32] and then it's just a matter
of review over time
[00:05:34] to get it really drilled
into my long term.
[00:05:36]  So let's get back.
[00:05:38] So Afghanistan, Albania, 
Algeria, Andora
[00:05:42] Angola,
[00:05:55] I'm going to call it here.
[00:05:56] 23 minutes.
[00:05:57] Now we got to test myself, right? 
Let's try it.
[00:06:00] All right, so we're back on day two.
[00:06:02] I figured I'd give this information 
a bit of a rest
[00:06:04] so that I could take advantage 
of some space repetition,
[00:06:08] which is where you study 
something for a little bit
[00:06:10] and you kind of let it 
consolidate over time.
[00:06:13]  It allows you to kind of have a better
handle on what
[00:06:15] you really know and 
what you need to work on.
[00:06:18]  So hopefully I know most of it. 
I'm going to
[00:06:19] test myself or repeat the information
[00:06:21] to see where I stand.
[00:06:23]  I couldn't get this guy
[00:06:25] to be quiet out of the shot,
[00:06:26]  so he's going to join me 
as I type this.
[00:06:28] I chose another website here because
[00:06:30] the sporkal one was kind of- 
the images for the flags were so
[00:06:34] small and pixelated that 
this was a little clearer.
[00:06:37] So.. Its says that there is
[00:06:39] it says that there is, like,
[00:06:41] 196 flags. I hope it's just maybe
[00:06:46] Kosovo.. and what's
 the other one? Taiwan,
[00:06:50] that I've seen on other lists, right?
[00:06:53] Anyways, let's get started. 
Hopefully I'm going for 100%
[00:06:56] because then this challenge will be over.
[00:06:59] All right. USA. UK.
[00:07:03] Australia.
[00:07:06] New..
[00:07:07] Zealand, Canada.
[00:07:11] Russia.
[00:07:14] Netherlands
[00:07:32] Nice.
[00:07:35] There it is. 100%, my friends.
[00:07:40] Yeah. With the baby in hand.
[00:07:42] Cool. It took me almost 15 minutes,
[00:07:44]  but with one hand and the baby, 
I think that's okay.
[00:07:46] All right, so I think the
most important thing
[00:07:49] to you as a viewer is
probably the question
[00:07:51] how did he do it? How does one memorize
[00:07:55] 195 close to 200 different patterns
[00:07:59] and relate them to
a country's name?
[00:08:01]  The basic idea behind
it is something I've
[00:08:03] talked about a million
times on this channel,
[00:08:05] and that's just linking.
[00:08:06] Basically coming up with a picture
[00:08:08] for something 
that you notice about the flag
[00:08:10] like a particular artifact 
or design or a color pattern.
[00:08:15] pattern, and then relating
that to some image related to
[00:08:17] the country. Now, there's
a lot of countries out there.
[00:08:20] Chances are not all
of them conjure up
[00:08:22] some image to the
mind. So you may have to
[00:08:25] break down the actual
word that is the country into
[00:08:27] something that you can
relate to and then relate that.
[00:08:30] Let's do some
examples. Because the way
[00:08:33] I see it, like we saw
at the beginning of this video
[00:08:35] I knew a lot, right? I knew over 50.
[00:08:37] So those were
ones I didn't have to
[00:08:39] think about. And I don't even
know why I know them,
[00:08:41] when I learned them, where I
learned them.
[00:08:43] They've just been
[00:08:44] part of my learn information since
the existence of Nelson.
[00:08:48] And you will have  your own, maybe
more, maybe less.
[00:08:51] So need to learn those. And
sometimes we can even
[00:08:54] use that information to help make
logical assumptions about why this
[00:08:59] other flag, similar to this
one, you know,
[00:09:02] is not that one, 
but is a different one.
[00:09:03] We'll get to that in a second.
[00:09:04] Then there are just
flags that make sense.
[00:09:06] You look at it and you say, you know what?
That makes sense for that country,
[00:09:09] and you have a reason why
those are simple.
[00:09:11] Then there are ones that have, like,
an obvious thing on them, a
[00:09:13] a design element, whether it's the
shape of the flag itself, an animal, or
[00:09:18] a series of symbols or
stars, you can use those.
[00:09:21] And then there's kind
of the category where
[00:09:23] you could do that, but
then there's like five other flags
[00:09:26] flags that have the same
similar pattern. So how do you
[00:09:28] distinguish between
them all? Coming up with
[00:09:30] just an image for that one
relation for that one flag
[00:09:33] may not be enough, because
when it comes to the other flags,
[00:09:36] you may get confused. So you
have to kind of distinguish those images
[00:09:38] from others. Okay,
let's do some examples.
[00:09:40] So let's start with flags that
have an interesting element on them
[00:09:43] that you can just use.
They are  unique compared to
[00:09:45] all the other flags, as
simple as that.
[00:09:47]  Angola, for example.
[00:09:48] Now, what did I think of-
 I've never been to Angola.
[00:09:50] I don't know much about
the country. But the flag here,
[00:09:53] I see there's like a sword here kind
of underneath the star.
[00:09:56] And so Angola,
[00:09:57] I think of like someone kicking and
scoring a goal.
[00:10:02] sword is actually like a foot
[00:10:04] or leg kicking this 
star into a goal.
[00:10:17] That's all I need. So when
I see that no other flag
[00:10:20] has that and it's right in
the middle,
[00:10:21] I'm gonna say, oh, it's like kicking a
goal. Angola.
[00:10:24] Barbados is a good one.
[00:10:25] because it has
that trident right in the middle.
[00:10:27] And tridents, they're
barbed, right?
[00:10:29] So Barbados. So some of
these, I don't even have
[00:10:32] to look at the color. I
just know if I see that one symbol.
[00:10:34] Boom, I have it.
[00:10:35] Alright, I think that's 
pretty straightforward in terms of
[00:10:37] okay, here's a flag with a pattern 
and some
[00:10:40] feature on it.
[00:10:41] Let me relate it to a
country.
[00:10:43] But I think where
it gets tricky, right,
[00:10:44] is when you have multiple ones 
that are similar.
[00:10:49] So let's look
at some that there are
[00:10:51] maybe two that kind of look the same
[00:10:53] out of all the flags.
[00:10:55]  A great example to start are
[00:10:56] Bahrain and Qatar.
[00:10:58] Now they're different colors. 
All right? Qatar is kind of this
[00:11:01] maroon, purple and white,
[00:11:03] while Bahrain is almost 
the same thing, but
[00:11:05] red and white.
[00:11:06]  Okay. So it's interesting
[00:11:08] because I don't have to
come up with an image to
[00:11:10] help me remember that.
When I see that little diagonal
[00:11:13] split white and some
other color, it's got to be
[00:11:15] Bahrain or Qatar. Just
the fact that I noticed
[00:11:18] these two flags are
similar is almost enough to
[00:11:20] help me remember
that it's one of those two countries.
[00:11:23] But how do I
tell the difference, right? So
[00:11:25] Bahrain, I might think
something related to red
[00:11:28] Why would Bahrain
be red? Maybe it's
[00:11:30] raining red. Qatar. I think it's
actually pronounced 'cutter', right?
[00:11:34] So maybe you cut someone
like a deeper maroon blood.
[00:11:40] What about
something like Belgium and Germany?
[00:11:42] Right? Same
exact colors. Black, yellow and red
[00:11:45] for Belgium - vertically.
[00:11:48] While Germany is black,
red, and yellow.
[00:11:50] Now, the order is different,
[00:11:51] but on a quick glance,
you could easily get confused.
[00:11:54] Now I know
what the colors are of both
[00:11:57] of those country flags. I
don't have to remember that.
[00:11:59] The black and the yellow and the red.
[00:12:01] It's just the positioning, right? So
[00:12:03] I can remember this.
[00:12:04] I think Belgium. I
think Belgium fries
[00:12:07] the elite, right? So
[00:12:08] fries usually come vertically
[00:12:10] in your little fry container. So...
[00:12:13] when I see that Belgium Germany colors,
[00:12:16] and I see them vertically, 
I've got to know it's Belgium
[00:12:18] because of the fries.
[00:12:19] And that's enough, right? I don't
even need to have anything for
[00:12:21] Germany because if it's not vertical,
[00:12:23] then it's got to be Germany.
If it's vertical, we got fries,
[00:12:25] it's Belgium.
[00:12:26] Now, what about
ones that there's multiple.
[00:12:28] So there are some
categories of flags where there's
[00:12:31] maybe four
to five to six that are
[00:12:33] very similar and easily confused.
Very common ones are the ones
[00:12:38] that are split into colors, white
and red, mainly Indonesia, Monaco,
[00:12:43] Singapore and Poland.
[00:12:45] Now, the way you can tell 
the difference is that Monaco
[00:12:48] is kind of the weirdest
shape one.
[00:12:50] And you can remember that because
it's kind of like a small,
[00:12:53] weird country on its own. So it's going
to have kind of a different flag.
[00:12:57]  Let's say.
[00:12:58] Both Indonesia and Monaco have the
red on the top.
[00:13:01]  Okay? Poland has the red on
the bottom
[00:13:04] and then Singapore
has the red on the top.
[00:13:07] But it has some symbols, some
stars and stuff.
[00:13:10] So the way I remember it is that
Poland is going to have the
[00:13:13] red on the bottom because you
stick a pole in the ground, and then I
[00:13:15] know just the other three are always
going to have the red on the top. I
[00:13:17] I know I can distinguish
that it's Monaco versus Indonesia
[00:13:20] If the flag is
shaped weird, then I know it's Monaco.
[00:13:22] It's more like a square.
[00:13:23] And then to tell between
Indonesia and Singapore,
[00:13:25] Singapore, I think of singing.
[00:13:27] It's basically Indonesia,
but people are
[00:13:29] singing there, right?
So when you sing,
[00:13:32] you have stars and things coming out of
your mouth.
[00:13:36]  So I could see like, something
with singing
[00:13:38] with singing might
have a little more
[00:13:39] ornateness to it.
[00:13:40] And then
finally, let's do one
[00:13:42] big horrible example. And that's the ones 
that are red white and blue.
[00:13:45] So what you have
[00:13:47] Russia, you have France,
you have the Netherlands,
[00:13:49] Luxembourg. I think
those are the only four with
[00:13:52] just the colors. And then you
have some that are the same
[00:13:54] red, white and blue, but
with some kind of feature on them.
[00:13:57] like Croatia, Paraguay,
Slovakia, or Slovenia.
[00:14:01] The ones that have
symbols on them,
[00:14:02] you can almost forget that they're
[00:14:03] red white and blue.
[00:14:04] white and blue. Don't confuse
yourself. Just look at something
[00:14:06] about the symbol and
distinguish it from the others.
[00:14:09] Now, France, most
people know the French flag.
[00:14:12] It's just super iconic.
It's the blue, white and the red
[00:14:16] vertical, right? And
again, if you want to
[00:14:18] remember that's vertical,
maybe think of Eiffel Tower.
[00:14:21] All very vertical
structures.
[00:14:23] So maybe that's what helps you
remember that.
[00:14:25] But I think the tricky ones 
to remember are maybe Russia,
[00:14:28] Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, 
especially Luxembourg, Netherlands
[00:14:31] because they are exactly
red white and blue
[00:14:33] But the Luxembourg color for blue
[00:14:35] is a little more dainty.
[00:14:38] And I might think, okay, 
Luxembourg, I think of something luxurious
[00:14:41] But that blue just does not look
luxurious. It's like they cut some
[00:14:44] costs for the sake of luxury. So whenever I
see that kind of funny off blue,
[00:14:49] it's not a very royal blue. 
That's the luxury less
[00:14:53] Luxembourg. And the other
one is the Netherlands.
[00:14:56] And then Russia is a bit
weird. If you really notice it,
[00:14:58] it starts with white on
the top, white, blue and red.
[00:15:02] So if you think of
America, red, white and blue.
[00:15:04] Russia is not going to
do it like America.
[00:15:06] So that's the one that's going to
kind of read off white, blue and red.
[00:15:10] Anyways, thanks for watching
this video. I hope it was interesting.
[00:15:13] I love memorizing stuff with geography,
[00:15:15] and I love that I finally 
put the flags down to memory
[00:15:18] because now I can
start to build on that.
[00:15:20] I can start to do the capitals. 
I've never done all the world capitals.
[00:15:23] I should do that.
[00:15:24] Then I can do like population.
[00:15:25] Then I could do
languages spoken, religions,
[00:15:28] whatever I want and just
add it, kind of pile it on
[00:15:30] top of everything that I
have, all the mnemonics,
[00:15:33] the links that I already
have, I can just add to that story
[00:15:35] and just have this whole
compendium of knowledge
[00:15:38] about all the countries in the
world. How cool is that? And
[00:15:40] And you can do that too. It's not
just me.
[00:15:42]  I hope you liked this video
[00:15:43] Let me know in the description 
what you'd like to see me memorize,
[00:15:46] what else I can explain
how to memorize
[00:15:48] and make sure to subscribe and like

=== how to pretend like you memorized an ENTIRE book #Shorts ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzLpjex8QVk

[00:00:00] i'm gonna look away i want you to say
[00:00:02] stop remember the first word in the page
[00:00:04] number of anyone i'm gonna stop right
[00:00:06] there
[00:00:07] yeah you got it yeah okay what was the
[00:00:09] word
[00:00:10] the the
[00:00:11] could be anything
[00:00:13] 180
[00:00:15] i'm looking away right whenever you say
[00:00:16] stop you're looking at that yeah all i
[00:00:19] have to do is peek at this page number
[00:00:21] okay while you're looking here yeah yeah
[00:00:24] so although i'm looking away as soon as
[00:00:26] you look down i can look here and just
[00:00:27] look away and so i know that whatever
[00:00:29] you say is going to be on the page
[00:00:31] before that right okay but you you
[00:00:33] wouldn't know the word nope but i say
[00:00:35] what's the word and i can tell you the
[00:00:36] page like this is very convincing to you
[00:00:37] that i'm looking away and all i have to
[00:00:38] do is that and i'm not looking at you
[00:00:40] yeah exactly and i'm going and i go back
[00:00:42] i
[00:00:43] yeah and i know you're looking at the
[00:00:44] page so i'm looking at the page too and
[00:00:46] i just turn around it's so stupid
[00:00:48] i'm gonna look away and i do this and
[00:00:50] just saying that and turning my head why
[00:00:52] would he lie about that right well
[00:00:53] that's the reason i would lie about the
[00:00:55] one thing i told you was true was a lie
[00:00:57] and that's all it takes


=== Here's the PROPER way to *FAKE* memorize a book (ft. @ChrisRamsay52) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LiUx2Pdu3A

[00:00:00] what's up guys nelson dallas here and i
[00:00:02] am with chris ramsay again it's been a
[00:00:04] few years hey what's up been good
[00:00:06] been good all right cool so we're gonna
[00:00:08] do something a little different uh
[00:00:10] you're gonna teach me how to do the i'm
[00:00:11] gonna teach you how i memorized
[00:00:14] every word in this book
[00:00:16] [Music]
[00:00:23] that's the book about you right there's
[00:00:26] a book yeah this this has me in it but
[00:00:28] it's not a special book by any means
[00:00:30] it's just uh it's just a book and as you
[00:00:32] can see here all the all the words are
[00:00:34] different it's not like a special you
[00:00:36] know what i mean it's not like it's not
[00:00:38] it's it's inspect yeah okay i mean this
[00:00:40] is the book that i have i have the hard
[00:00:42] copy book oh you gotta actually got a
[00:00:43] card in there let's take that card out
[00:00:45] with cards part of the trick those four
[00:00:47] spades right oh how did he know yeah
[00:00:48] looks looks legit all right yeah so yeah
[00:00:52] every every word in this book and uh i
[00:00:54] guess we could get some b-roll of like
[00:00:55] showing this to like the camera or
[00:00:57] something sure that they're all okay i'm
[00:00:59] gonna run my my finger down the side and
[00:01:01] i want you to say stop whenever you want
[00:01:03] okay
[00:01:05] stop right there yeah
[00:01:08] remember the first word
[00:01:10] okay wait on which page this one here oh
[00:01:12] okay yeah you got it yeah
[00:01:15] i don't know if i
[00:01:17] what page was it no oh you didn't look
[00:01:19] at the page 154 maybe oh okay remember
[00:01:22] the page and the first word okay
[00:01:24] go ahead and say stop stop right there
[00:01:26] yeah
[00:01:26] okay
[00:01:28] look at this
[00:01:29] okay page number and
[00:01:32] word i got it got it yeah okay
[00:01:34] um
[00:01:35] what page 178
[00:01:39] bits yeah
[00:01:41] can we do another one yeah you can do as
[00:01:43] many as you like okay
[00:01:44] say stop whenever
[00:01:49] stop right there yeah
[00:01:54] okay
[00:01:56] page number and word
[00:01:58] yeah i got it yeah what's the page uh
[00:02:00] 218.
[00:02:02] sci-fi
[00:02:04] that's weird i mean i'm trying to see if
[00:02:06] you're doing something tricky it looks
[00:02:08] like you should do something tricky when
[00:02:09] you
[00:02:10] take the book but i don't see you
[00:02:11] looking at it so i don't know is it like
[00:02:13] a reflection no no reflection
[00:02:16] okay could i ask you a page right now no
[00:02:19] okay
[00:02:21] no because i'm done so a book test is
[00:02:23] basically a magician's way of proving to
[00:02:25] you that he knows every page or every
[00:02:28] word in the book and there are hundreds
[00:02:30] of book tests out there some better than
[00:02:32] others this is a really simple one that
[00:02:33] you can do to simulate
[00:02:35] having a good memory because uh i always
[00:02:37] tell nelson i'm like i can prove to
[00:02:40] anyone that i can do what you do
[00:02:42] you work way too hard at what you do
[00:02:44] yeah because i i don't spend any time
[00:02:48] because how many how many uh pages are
[00:02:49] here oh you know what 300 300 so i could
[00:02:52] memorize the first word on every page in
[00:02:54] 15 minutes
[00:02:55] that would be a fun thing to do
[00:02:57] um but yeah that's still too much work
[00:03:00] it's crazy though yeah yeah that's way
[00:03:02] too much work but that is crazy that is
[00:03:03] more impressive but at the end of the
[00:03:05] day we're both doing the same thing yeah
[00:03:07] right to the viewer yeah exactly that's
[00:03:09] the only thing that's frustrating
[00:03:11] the trick
[00:03:13] involves slight peak a pinky break and a
[00:03:16] force it's all involved all right so
[00:03:18] what i'm doing is i'm opening the book
[00:03:19] and i'm just kind of like showing you
[00:03:21] that all the pages are different as soon
[00:03:22] as i see a page that i want to stay on
[00:03:25] right let's say it's here my pinky on
[00:03:29] the bottom and we can show this from a
[00:03:30] different angle my pinky on the bottom
[00:03:31] stays here and i just kind of keep keep
[00:03:34] a little break okay
[00:03:36] and is it important to maybe choose
[00:03:37] something
[00:03:39] a certain distance
[00:03:40] because like when you say you know yeah
[00:03:42] i mean i can control that people will
[00:03:44] not wait till you get to like here yeah
[00:03:47] well if they do like if i do
[00:03:50] if i'm towards the end and they say stop
[00:03:52] around here like that obviously there's
[00:03:54] there's slight discrepancies that you
[00:03:56] can get over but if it's too wild like
[00:03:58] if you pass the point and they go stop
[00:04:00] just go like that just go oh i'll say it
[00:04:01] sooner just riffle keep wrestling really
[00:04:04] quick you know what i mean right yeah
[00:04:05] it's kind of like a little timing for so
[00:04:07] yeah you look for the page let's say
[00:04:08] here it's sure but i'm gonna keep going
[00:04:11] so you know it before yeah i just peek
[00:04:13] at it right there and wherever i get the
[00:04:14] break is where i'm i'm here
[00:04:16] and you can't see the break
[00:04:18] yeah right you can't see the break from
[00:04:19] any angle i'll do it in here okay and so
[00:04:22] once i'm here on the bottom i have this
[00:04:24] now i'm going to do um a sort of uh a
[00:04:27] force here where i can stop
[00:04:29] exactly on the page that i'm on but it
[00:04:32] looks like so if you say stop right here
[00:04:34] yeah i'll
[00:04:35] simulate doing this
[00:04:37] and i'll open the break and i'll come
[00:04:39] back up and open uh yeah right so it
[00:04:42] kind of looks like you're saying you're
[00:04:44] saying stop and i'm not letting you peek
[00:04:45] at the page by the way uh so i can do
[00:04:47] you do is just say stop whenever you
[00:04:49] want i go here look at the so now i just
[00:04:52] opened at where my pinky was and all i
[00:04:54] had to do was remember the uh first word
[00:04:56] and all you have to do is tell me what
[00:04:57] the page is yeah i don't know what the
[00:04:59] page is i didn't remember that oh so
[00:05:00] that doesn't even matter i didn't even
[00:05:02] have to remember the page only you did
[00:05:03] you remembered more things than i did
[00:05:05] during that trick that's crazy yeah does
[00:05:07] it it's probably better with a paperback
[00:05:09] it is better with the paperback and the
[00:05:10] thicker the paperback the better as well
[00:05:12] well thank you for sharing that i'm
[00:05:13] gonna practice that now i don't have to
[00:05:14] memorize 300 and whatever words yeah i
[00:05:17] mean you could have that would have been
[00:05:19] that'd have been cool 15 minutes yeah i
[00:05:22] mean my record that's probably pushing
[00:05:24] it but but there's some blank pages does
[00:05:26] that throw you off
[00:05:27] no i guess i would have to come up with
[00:05:29] an image does that count as a page yeah
[00:05:31] page though yep so 156 157 158
[00:05:35] and then yeah they're actually a few
[00:05:36] pages in a row that didn't have anything
[00:05:38] well i guess this would have
[00:05:39] and then some i saw had like the end of
[00:05:41] a word like
[00:05:42] yeah yeah that's weird but that's fine
[00:05:44] yeah exactly like uh yeah ing
[00:05:48] yep
[00:05:50] yeah let me i mean let me just do like
[00:05:52] the first 20 words let's see what that's
[00:05:53] like so when i was sitting with chris
[00:05:55] and i said i'll do like 20 words you
[00:05:57] know great but i realized it was a bit
[00:06:00] of a cop-out and that i probably should
[00:06:02] do the entire book just to show you what
[00:06:05] it would look like what it entails for
[00:06:07] numerous reasons one to show that it's
[00:06:09] possible two for a fun little
[00:06:11] memory demo and three to also show what
[00:06:14] it actually means to memorize a book and
[00:06:17] even that is not truly memorizing a book
[00:06:19] because all i would be doing is
[00:06:21] memorizing the first word on each page
[00:06:24] not the entire book i have a time right
[00:06:26] here
[00:06:27] we'll put it up you can see that yes
[00:06:30] put that right there i propose it's
[00:06:32] gonna take me about 15 minutes probably
[00:06:34] longer i haven't done this in a while
[00:06:36] the book i have
[00:06:38] is the same book chris was using
[00:06:39] although this is the hard copy version
[00:06:43] and uh in terms of i don't think the
[00:06:45] mage the pages line up exactly as the
[00:06:47] paperback that he had
[00:06:49] but uh looking here
[00:06:51] it looks like
[00:06:53] this is page one all right you guys see
[00:06:56] that prologue there
[00:06:58] and then
[00:07:00] ends on i think there's an
[00:07:01] acknowledgement page so 320
[00:07:05] all right or 319 technically if you want
[00:07:08] to stop there so what i'm gonna do is
[00:07:10] just memorize the first
[00:07:12] word on each page now if it's a blank
[00:07:14] page i'm just gonna obviously memorize
[00:07:17] that there was nothing there but i'm
[00:07:19] still responsible for memorizing that so
[00:07:22] in short to memorize the first word on
[00:07:24] each page of this book i basically need
[00:07:26] 150 160 uh locations i'm memorizing two
[00:07:30] words at a time
[00:07:32] so let's get to it
[00:07:36] you see that yeah you can see the book
[00:07:38] here it is
[00:07:39] same book as before
[00:07:43] [Music]
[00:08:15] okay so we're up to 240
[00:08:17] quite a bit over the time but
[00:08:19] so be it i'm a little out of practice
[00:08:21] but let's
[00:08:22] um let me do a quick review and then we
[00:08:24] have the last 60 70 pages
[00:08:33] [Music]
[00:08:38] [Music]
[00:08:44] 25 minutes all right that's not too bad
[00:08:46] 25 minutes to memorize a book it's far a
[00:08:47] cry from bj's 10 minute massive book
[00:08:51] knowing every word but hey
[00:08:53] when you do it honest this is what you
[00:08:55] get is it impressive i think still so a
[00:08:58] little bit right chris what do you think
[00:09:00] good
[00:09:01] good all right so let's put it to the
[00:09:03] test uh i've got a randomizer here so
[00:09:06] we'll just randomize a page between 1
[00:09:07] and 319
[00:09:09] and we'll see if i can get the word
[00:09:12] right
[00:09:16] what is it 20 all right page 20.
[00:09:21] [Music]
[00:09:24] uh this should be width width page 20 is
[00:09:27] width
[00:09:33] there it is
[00:09:34] nice all right let's do another one all
[00:09:37] right
[00:09:40] 264.
[00:09:42] all right
[00:09:46] i think it's i think it's i
[00:09:49] easy as i
[00:09:51] 264
[00:09:54] 264.
[00:09:56] i my friends
[00:09:58] all right let's do another one to be
[00:10:00] fair here
[00:10:02] all right 21 that's not fair i just did
[00:10:04] 20 which was with so 21 would be uh
[00:10:08] daily
[00:10:09] daily just to make sure we have
[00:10:16] that right there's a page
[00:10:20] put the focus in there
[00:10:24] and then daily
[00:10:28] okay let's do another one
[00:10:32] 106. 106.
[00:10:35] that is gonna be
[00:10:40] i think it's a blank page
[00:10:43] 106 is a blank page
[00:10:51] can't tell but
[00:10:53] on the previous page
[00:10:58] you have 105. so you see that 105.
[00:11:02] another blank page
[00:11:04] all right one last one for good measure
[00:11:06] and then i'll shut the hell up
[00:11:10] what is that
[00:11:11] 65
[00:11:15] 65.
[00:11:17] [Music]
[00:11:24] tom
[00:11:27] now i think it could be the end of a
[00:11:28] conjunction word uh let's see
[00:11:36] yeah there it is
[00:11:38] all right there is uh
[00:11:40] 65. and there is tom and it actually is
[00:11:44] the end of
[00:11:45] custom custom custom so tom
[00:11:50] all right well that was a waste of 30
[00:11:52] minutes but there you go i essentially
[00:11:53] have this book next time i see chris i
[00:11:55] can maybe amaze him uh or not he could
[00:11:58] probably do that same effect with no
[00:11:59] memorization whatsoever anyways back to
[00:12:02] the video one thing that's nice with
[00:12:04] magic it's very deceptive uh in showing
[00:12:07] that the prop is normal
[00:12:08] that's where your preparation comes we
[00:12:11] call that an offbeat that's when their
[00:12:12] guard is down because i haven't started
[00:12:14] the trick okay
[00:12:16] uh if i was like okay
[00:12:18] so i'm gonna take this book and uh
[00:12:21] remember every you know like it becomes
[00:12:23] weird but if i'm showing you all right i
[00:12:25] just want you to make sure that this is
[00:12:26] a normal book right
[00:12:28] you can have a look everything's normal
[00:12:30] right yep so your guards down you're not
[00:12:34] looking for a method you're not thinking
[00:12:36] i'm in the trick because i haven't
[00:12:38] started yet when in fact i have started
[00:12:40] and that's the deceptive thing i've
[00:12:41] already caught my break so again you're
[00:12:42] going this way and it's important to do
[00:12:44] this side
[00:12:45] here because you're going to be
[00:12:47] doing this to them right so you want
[00:12:49] that page once you find the word let's
[00:12:50] say including is the word my left pinky
[00:12:52] is going to insert the book and i'm
[00:12:54] going to keep going and i'm going to
[00:12:55] keep showing other pages just to
[00:12:57] convince them that i'm doing that as i'm
[00:13:00] here all i'm doing is keeping my break
[00:13:02] there
[00:13:04] and just holding the book like this
[00:13:05] there's no way that they from their
[00:13:07] angle can see this right if i keep the
[00:13:09] book closed there's no way from any
[00:13:11] other angle other than underneath that i
[00:13:13] have a break right
[00:13:15] now i'm going to riffle my index down i
[00:13:17] want to be careful not to reveal too
[00:13:18] much of the page because then they can
[00:13:20] see exactly
[00:13:21] uh where you know where i've actually
[00:13:25] stopped or where they've stopped and we
[00:13:27] don't want we don't want them looking at
[00:13:28] a random word ladies and gentlemen we do
[00:13:30] not want that
[00:13:31] all right we want them to look at our
[00:13:33] word the word that we chose yeah so the
[00:13:35] way that we do that you small breaking
[00:13:36] you just say say stop whatever they want
[00:13:38] stop now from here there's two ways to
[00:13:40] do it you can take your pinky and just
[00:13:42] open up the book
[00:13:44] at that right so if you extend your
[00:13:46] pinky it'll just open there so if i stop
[00:13:48] here which is not my break
[00:13:50] and i just open at
[00:13:52] the break with my pinky it still looks
[00:13:54] very convincing
[00:13:55] i like to do a small subtlety where i'm
[00:13:57] here i run my finger down so it looks
[00:14:00] like i'm opening at that page yeah and
[00:14:03] then once i'm down here i just open at
[00:14:05] my break so my break is here obviously
[00:14:08] they say stop before
[00:14:10] i run down
[00:14:12] and as i run down i can feel with my
[00:14:14] other with my index finger where that
[00:14:16] break is right yeah so boom stop right
[00:14:18] here
[00:14:20] cool and you can just open up and it's
[00:14:22] and even if i go past it which is kind
[00:14:24] of interesting you can still uh you can
[00:14:26] still come back it's a bit harder do it
[00:14:28] in the other direction yeah you can
[00:14:30] still come back to that if you want
[00:14:32] so once again
[00:14:34] you flip through you find the word you
[00:14:35] like we got the word trying we're gonna
[00:14:37] keep going we're here we hold our break
[00:14:40] they say stop i run down come up and
[00:14:42] look at the
[00:14:44] trying it is nice
[00:14:47] cool
[00:14:48] now
[00:14:49] i mean now you can unsubscribe from
[00:14:50] nelson and just subscribe to me instead
[00:14:52] because it's so much faster you don't
[00:14:54] have to put all the work in
[00:14:56] you don't have to study it's not brain
[00:14:58] wracking it's very easy it takes two
[00:15:00] minutes yeah then your brain turns to
[00:15:02] mush your brain turns too much that's
[00:15:04] true
[00:15:05] but i will not stop trying to convince
[00:15:07] nelson that i actually can do what he
[00:15:09] does
[00:15:10] every time he comes you're gonna be like
[00:15:11] oh i learned a new skill how'd you do it
[00:15:13] i'm like
[00:15:15] magic
[00:15:16] anyways thanks for watching guys hope
[00:15:18] that was cool i'll be doing some more
[00:15:19] content with chris in the upcoming
[00:15:21] months so stay tuned for that please
[00:15:23] like share and subscribe and i'll be
[00:15:25] back very soon with another video i'm
[00:15:27] out
[00:15:28] [Music]
[00:15:41] you


=== I became a Guess Who?™ GENIUS (and so can you!) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c0OzbgNycY

[00:00:00] board games that might trigger some 
memories for you you played a little clue  
[00:00:04] you played some connect four maybe even a little 
bit of monopoly but how about that goddamit game  
[00:00:11] guess who you know the game where you basically 
go back and forth guessing each other's character  
[00:00:16] asking whether your person has a hat whether 
he has a beard whether he looks like a serial  
[00:00:20] killer whether he's up to no good i mean what 
you up to alex anyways today we are learning  
[00:00:26] how to memorize all the people and characters 
inside of the guess who game and we are becoming  
[00:00:33] guests who geniuses this is a completely 
useless memory skill but you roll
[00:00:54] oh hi there while you're here have you read my 
book yet oh you haven't well let me tell you this  
[00:01:01] little baby right here is a book i published 
a few years ago to help you remember more and  
[00:01:07] to remember it wow you ever get tired of 
you know that whole noggin of yours just  
[00:01:13] being completely useless for getting [ __ ] 
left and right no more my friends this book  
[00:01:19] has it all has how to remember faces how to 
remember your credit cards how to remember  
[00:01:24] your appointments how to remember whether 
you left your kids at the grocery store mommy  
[00:01:28] where's my mommy all that crucial life-saving 
stuff what's in here so you better get it if  
[00:01:33] you don't want it buy for someone else they'll 
love it oh and if you have kids we also got this  
[00:01:39] one same exact thing but written in a format 
for kids in grade school or depending on your  
[00:01:43] reading level is perfect for adults too can you 
read this there's no pictures anyways where was
[00:01:54] oh yeah i remember the page
[00:01:58] all right so we all know the 
game guess who right two players  
[00:02:02] 24 characters with super distinguishing 
features the goal of the game is to guess  
[00:02:06] the other person before they guess yours end of 
game voila but what if you could play the game  
[00:02:12] without the board and only your 
noggin not much would happen really  
[00:02:16] other than you being an absolute so with 
all that said let's memorize this shall we
[00:02:24] all right so for phase one you're going to want 
to memorize all 24 names along with their faces  
[00:02:30] you need to know these people in order to play the 
game without a board right i mean to win the game  
[00:02:34] the last question you have to ask is is your 
person sam or is your person bernard so at the  
[00:02:40] very least you need to know all their names and 
vaguely what they look like now i don't want you  
[00:02:45] guys to be like oh nelson i don't know if i just 
memorize their name i'm not gonna know what they  
[00:02:49] look like but you will because by the process of 
memorizing someone's name you're gonna be using a  
[00:02:55] feature on their face to memorize the name you're 
gonna have some very basic information about what  
[00:03:01] these fools look like will this win you the game 
not yet but we gotta start somewhere so for each  
[00:03:06] of the 24 people i'm going to give you a little 
mnemonic to remember their ugly little faces
[00:03:14] all right bernard looks like he's part of the 
kgb he's got that little soviet little hat on  
[00:03:18] bernard i think of burning something hard next we 
have anita and whenever i whenever i hear anita or  
[00:03:26] see the name anita i think of anita man i need a 
man isn't that a oh yeah i need a man a kiss and  
[00:03:30] hug no amanda kissing hug hey i'm looking for 
amanda hugging kiss why can't i find a man to  
[00:03:36] hug and kiss what am i saying okay i need a makes 
me think of someone who needs something so that's  
[00:03:41] what she's saying she's saying anita i need a man 
all right here we go sam the bowling ball head  
[00:03:46] here sam i always think of a sandwich literally 
gonna picture a sandwich on top of his bald head  
[00:03:52] there bill reminds me of the word hill so i just 
imagine that his head is like a really big hill  
[00:03:58] alex god this guy's weird what's that what's with 
that eyebrow that one is he insane anyway so alex  
[00:04:04] i think of alexis alexis like at the car so i'm 
just gonna imagine a little lexus car driving  
[00:04:09] across from one mustache to the other room robert 
this guy looks so sad this is the saddest guy of  
[00:04:15] guess who robert rob sounds like rub i'm rubbing 
his cheeks so hard that his they turn red and  
[00:04:21] maybe he's sad about that now we got george 
what is this guy dick tracy want to be anyways  
[00:04:26] george i think of george of the jungle some guy 
swinging on a vine and splatting against the wall
[00:04:35] and this splattering is gonna 
happen against his fedora here
[00:04:41] next we have philip now this guy has 
this whole face covered in hair here  
[00:04:46] so phillip sounds like it's filling 
up something so i'm just going to  
[00:04:49] imagine his whole chin strap beard slash 
connecting hair whatever that is he's just  
[00:04:53] filling it up i can see the action of 
filling up his face with all this hair  
[00:04:57] jojo joe i think of like a sloppy joe so i'm 
just gonna imagine splattering that sloppy joe  
[00:05:03] all over his glasses here kind of dripping down 
his red glasses all right we got max here now  
[00:05:08] this guy i'm for sure convinced he has the biggest 
nose of them all max he's got the max sized nose
[00:05:16] all right maria maria i want to marry her mary 
maria imagine a little wedding going on on top  
[00:05:21] of her little beret there maybe that's where the 
ceremony is taking place and there's a bunch of  
[00:05:25] people seated on her hat this guy is for sure 
psycho killer and i think of alfred like alfredo  
[00:05:31] sauce so i'm just gonna imagine kind of all over 
his weird ginger mustache is some alfredo sauce  
[00:05:38] with noodles kind of wrapped up there france makes 
me think of france the country a picture of the  
[00:05:43] country france or even maybe a french flag and 
he's got such a tiny little mouth right so maybe  
[00:05:47] let's imagine on his tiny little mouth is the 
french flag peter is this rodney dangerfield i  
[00:05:54] said this has got to be him or based on him right 
peter i think of peter griffin from family guy  
[00:06:01] that's it all right richard i'm gonna imagine 
on his uh dome there a bunch of stacks of  
[00:06:05] bills he's rich dave i think of like diving 
i'm gonna dive into his blonde little beard  
[00:06:12] uh chin strap beard thing there now we got 
herman i know herman might reminds me of like  
[00:06:16] a merman like a male uh mermaid merman merman 
so i would imagine a merman her man flopping  
[00:06:25] across his bald head there eric i guess he's 
uh a cop kind of a creepy looking cop if you  
[00:06:32] ask me there's something going on with this 
guy but eric rick i think of like rick rolled
[00:06:38] i know that's a few steps away but eric brick roll 
alright we got tom i think of like tom thumb so i  
[00:06:44] got a thumb i'm just poking his thumb into his 
glasses all right we're almost done here paul  
[00:06:49] paul i always think of the action of pulling 
so i'm pulling his glasses down his face all  
[00:06:53] right susan i think of like a crep suzette 
so imagine that i'm putting a crep splatting  
[00:06:58] it on her big lips there two more charles i 
think of like charlie chaplin charles chaplin  
[00:07:04] so maybe on his long kind of handlebar mustache 
is charlie chaplin doing a bit or we got claire  
[00:07:10] okay claire i think of something clear so imagine 
being able to look through her funky glasses there  
[00:07:17] and it's clear as day alright and then and my 
image for anne is ant so i'm gonna imagine on her  
[00:07:22] hoop earrings since that's her defining feature 
here i'm gonna imagine an ant colony climbing  
[00:07:26] around all those earrings all right so we have all 
24 people memorized let's just try to see how far  
[00:07:34] that actually takes us like if somebody were to 
say the name of a person could we describe some  
[00:07:39] of their features and vice versa if they said oh 
there's a guy or a girl with these features pretty  
[00:07:44] lips big eyes blue eyes parted hair whatever 
could you say oh that's bill sexy old bill
[00:07:53] so let's try i've got a random number generator 
here i've got a list of all 24 people here just  
[00:07:59] in random order so let's generate one here 14. all 
right so we got charles here charles uh is blonde  
[00:08:06] he's a man obviously and his distinguishing 
feature is this blonde kind of like handlebar  
[00:08:11] mustache right i guess let's see there he is yeah 
okay yeah i guess we could also say he's got brown  
[00:08:18] eyes big ears and parted hair big ass lips but 
yeah i could point that guy out of the lineup  
[00:08:25] i'm the guy all right try another one play along 
with me all right all right four who's number four  
[00:08:31] paul okay paul he has white hair it's kind of 
like wavy um he's got these glasses like little  
[00:08:39] what do you call them reading glasses right yeah 
and that's kind of it yeah that's pretty good  
[00:08:43] he's got the wavy hair white hair maybe a long 
chin i could have added long ears little mouth  
[00:08:49] all right let's do one more 15 who's that that's 
max all right max yeah i can picture him he's got  
[00:08:56] a big mouth big nose brown or black sorry black 
mustache kind of round hair black hair remembered  
[00:09:03] him because he had the maximum sized nose let's 
see if we can find him yeah there he is perfect
[00:09:12] all right so now let's do the reverse 
right like let's say i shuffle the cards  
[00:09:15] and i'm going to look at a random photo but 
try to hide out the name all right which is  
[00:09:20] going to be on the bottom so maybe let me 
just turn it around all right this is joe  
[00:09:25] all right well i can just go through 
the deck honestly so this is joe  
[00:09:29] this is david this is i saw that maria or 
marie maria this is peter susan bill eric  
[00:09:40] bernard herman phillip richard yep 
robert charles max anita ann george  
[00:09:54] paul sam alfred uh alex tom 
and claire yeah i got them all
[00:10:08] all right so we have the people and their names 
right but does that make us necessarily a genius  
[00:10:13] i feel like being part of a guest who genius you 
have to be able to play the game against someone  
[00:10:17] obviously without the board or seeing any of 
the cards but to play it really well meaning  
[00:10:22] you got to know which questions to ask right 
and if that question is answered yes or no  
[00:10:28] to get to one of these people right now this is 
been a video about the math and the best possible  
[00:10:33] questions to ask that's already been done there's 
a great video by mark rover he did it like a bunch  
[00:10:38] of years ago about the best way to win guess who 
it's super fun you should watch it make sure you  
[00:10:42] check that out but the strategy that i'm gonna 
teach you is guaranteed to win 92 of the time
[00:10:52] all you have to do is memorize this binary tree
[00:10:58] for all you non-computer scientists 
out there binary tree is basically  
[00:11:02] a tree shaped data structure that has at 
most two branches for every node binary two  
[00:11:10] right splits in two now in layman's terms just 
imagine that you start at the top of your tree  
[00:11:15] this is called a node every node has two branches 
a left and a right we call the top node the parent  
[00:11:21] and then the two branching nodes are children 
and each child has its own two branches that  
[00:11:27] lead to its two children and so on and so on 
and depending on the complexity of this tree  
[00:11:32] you can have a lot of different options depending 
on which way you go if you've seen my video on  
[00:11:36] morse code you might remember the binary tree that 
we learned to memorize the letters dots or dashes  
[00:11:43] now why do binary trees matter well because we are 
basically going to be asking a series of questions  
[00:11:48] which the person will answer yes or no that's the 
binary part and depending on whether they say yes
[00:11:57] yes or no no god we go down one 
branch of the tree versus the other  
[00:12:03] and eventually it'll lead us to peter or max or 
mary that's the goal is to ask as few questions  
[00:12:10] to get to our person as fast as possible 
and don't worry i've already broken down  
[00:12:15] all the questions you need to ask and 
what that tree looks like here it is
[00:12:25] cool now how do we memorize this tree all right 
so i've talked about memory palaces before  
[00:12:30] and typically you go through a memory palace 
with a starting point and an end point and  
[00:12:34] you just navigate through it in a way that makes 
sense something that you don't have to memorize  
[00:12:38] something that you would do ordinarily right 
and it makes sense in some kind of clockwise  
[00:12:43] or counterclockwise way now with memorizing a 
binary tree what you can do is imagine being  
[00:12:48] in front of this memory palace forget about the 
order of how you went through everything in the  
[00:12:53] beginning treat the different areas the locations 
as if they were parts of a binary tree if you're  
[00:12:58] looking at the top and then breaking it down 
into subsections it won't be a perfect tree  
[00:13:03] to split up evenly if you're looking at your 
memory palace maybe the left side could be the  
[00:13:07] first bifurcation left side of the tree if 
you're looking down it and then the other  
[00:13:12] right side could be the right side right so if 
you have one starting question which is does the  
[00:13:17] person have a big mouth then if they say yes you 
go to the left if they say no you go to the right  
[00:13:23] and then maybe you land in another area of your 
memory palace and you continue that process  
[00:13:28] down the tree it's a bit tricky because if you 
were to probably sketch out your memory palace  
[00:13:32] from overhead it won't look like a nice tree but 
you should try to kind of keep it so that it is  
[00:13:38] somewhat organized by left right child this 
might sound a little confusing so let's get  
[00:13:43] to some paper so i can show you what my memory 
palace would look like and then let's put it to  
[00:13:47] the test all right so let's take a look at what 
the actual binary tree is now there's this fancy  
[00:13:52] infographic on the web here that i found on a 
really nice article on nerdist that shows it kind  
[00:13:58] of sideways here if we rotate it now you have a 
tree at the top the top note is big mouth meaning  
[00:14:04] these are questions does your person have a big 
mouth questions that could either be yes or no  
[00:14:08] and if you go yes you go down to the left if you 
go no you go down to the right and eventually you  
[00:14:14] end up at the person right there they all are 
all right so let's look at an example of one  
[00:14:20] of my memory palaces that i've actually turned 
into this binary tree to memorize exactly these  
[00:14:27] questions all right so if you look here this is 
an overview that i've drawn of one of my classic  
[00:14:32] memory policies that i use for cards and typically 
when i'll go through this for cards is i'll start  
[00:14:39] actually in the bedroom over here and kind of 
make my way clockwise through the whole thing  
[00:14:43] but because it's a binary tree i'm going to do it 
a little bit differently i'm going to start with  
[00:14:47] some specific location as the root node and i'm 
going to make that the front the driveway and  
[00:14:53] then i'm going to start going in these directions 
left side and right side and kind of work my way  
[00:14:59] around this memory palace not in a clockwise or 
counterclockwise way but in this splitting up of  
[00:15:05] kind of a left area and a right area 
and that's going to map to the actual  
[00:15:09] questions that i have to memorize on my tree now 
this is what it looks like when i lay over what  
[00:15:16] i've mapped i know it looks like a big mess here 
but basically the driveway here is going to be  
[00:15:21] my root node and i put a little note about what 
the actual question is and the first question  
[00:15:27] like i said before is does your person have a big 
mouth so if they do have a big mouth then i go to  
[00:15:32] the left if they don't if they say no you go to 
the right so if they say yes the next location  
[00:15:37] would be to the left into the office here on 
the left side of my memory palace and that's  
[00:15:42] the next question does your person have black hair 
whereas if they said no i go to the other right  
[00:15:48] side of the driveway and ask does your person 
have curly hair or not and you're going to keep on  
[00:15:54] going breaking off in two directions until 
eventually mapping to the actual infographic  
[00:15:58] you end up at a person and there's your answer 
now obviously how does this help memorize it  
[00:16:03] well you got to come up with images right for 
each of the questions so at my root note i'm  
[00:16:07] going to picture an actual big mouth just sitting 
there in my driveway so i know the question is  
[00:16:13] does your person have a big mouth and then in 
my two yes no locations on this binary split up  
[00:16:19] you know one is going to be black hair 
so in my office here i'm going to picture  
[00:16:23] my father's desk covered in black hair and 
in the other direction i'm going to imagine  
[00:16:28] curly hair kind of coming out of the the tiles 
on the ground so in the end if you memorize  
[00:16:34] all the people's names you go through that 
process you're gonna know their faces pretty well  
[00:16:38] and then if you memorize this tree or these 
series of questions you're guaranteed to be a  
[00:16:44] guess who genius nobody can beat you and you'll 
know everybody in the game how cool is that  
[00:16:49] a little bit maybe it is probably one of the 
more not useful things you could memorize  
[00:16:54] but hey it's a cool party trick now this video 
wouldn't be complete unless we actually played  
[00:17:00] a game of guess who without a board so my guinea 
pig my wife i'm gonna play against my wife  
[00:17:06] and beat her in a game of guess who 
with zero board just my memory let's try
[00:17:25] hello oh god i'm gonna win so i'm here with my 
wife leah dallas over there and we're gonna play a  
[00:17:35] game of guess who two quick things one i apologize 
for my snoring dog that you can hear through the  
[00:17:40] entire game in the audio and two you'll notice 
that i actually don't ask for the first question  
[00:17:46] does your person have a big mouth instead i say 
does your person have a small mouth and really  
[00:17:52] it's the same question just the inverse so all i'm 
doing i have the same thing memorized but if they  
[00:17:57] say yes i'm actually going down the no track for 
do they have a big mouth get my drift the reason  
[00:18:03] i do this is because it's actually i think easier 
to say if a person has a small mouth rather than  
[00:18:08] do they have a big mouth because i think the big 
mouth thing is more subjective i don't know that's  
[00:18:12] just kind of my experience all right back to the 
game uh i think you shuffle and choose a card  
[00:18:18] right and then i'll choose a card yeah 
i don't know it's actually been years  
[00:18:22] yeah so what's your goal here i feel like you need 
to know what you're doing i'm just gonna try to  
[00:18:26] beat you faster all right it will play a few games 
but the goal is with what i've memorized wait so  
[00:18:32] oh and then i put the things down yeah that's for 
you this is to help yourself right because you're  
[00:18:39] you don't know but i'm i'm doing it from memory 
right but you have to have the visual cues to see  
[00:18:44] who's left confused because you don't have a board 
round one fight does your person have an accessory  
[00:18:51] no it's a good question but i don't 
know if that eliminates much for you
[00:18:58] okay i guess that was a good question does 
your person have an extraordinarily small mouth  
[00:19:04] yes yes yes okay what a specific question 
does your person have red hair yes yeah  
[00:19:21] are you kidding me okay does your person have 
curly hair no does your person have long hair no
[00:19:34] so this technique that i'm using i'm 
supposed to win 92 percent of the time  
[00:19:39] but i'm still even if i lose i'm still doing this 
with my own head does your person have um long  
[00:19:47] hair no no okay all right is your person herman 
you're already gonna ask the question because  
[00:19:54] then you lose if it's wrong wait what do you mean 
that's that's the whole point of the game are you  
[00:19:59] sure those are the rules yes because if if not 
at the beginning you're just guessing one no
[00:20:08] is your person involved yes is 
your person friends yes it is
[00:20:16] all right does your person have 
an extraordinarily small mouth  
[00:20:19] i would say it's a small mouth 
is your personal woman yes
[00:20:26] does your person have curly hair 
yeah does your person have a hat nay
[00:20:33] so now i'm going to ask does your person have 
ginger hair like reddish hair yes okay does  
[00:20:40] your person have earrings nope okay is your person 
bald yeah yeah okay i know who it is all right go  
[00:20:48] does your person have pigtails yes can i guess no 
that's your that's the next question any questions  
[00:20:55] yes because because then you're gonna need a 
video no because then you'll have two questions  
[00:21:00] right you'll be like is your does your person 
have pigtails and then you your next question  
[00:21:03] would be like is your person blah blah yeah you're 
in the same situation as me as your person herman  
[00:21:09] he's your person anita no it's my turn 
yes or no okay so i win i win mr dallas
[00:21:21] is your first involved no does 
your person have a small mouth  
[00:21:27] yes does your person have an accessory 
on yes does your person have curly hair  
[00:21:35] no sorry uh yes right did you present curly 
hair now is your person wearing a hat no
[00:21:46] does your person have long hair no is your person 
wearing glasses no do your person have pigtails  
[00:21:55] yes okay so now i have to i have to step 
it up here is your person um richard
[00:22:09] all right yeah all right guys thanks for 
watching i hope you enjoyed that thanks for  
[00:22:13] taking me on didn't stand a chance find 
that game in your old cupboard and play  
[00:22:17] against somebody in your family and and 
childhood nostalgia learn it by memory  
[00:22:22] cool totally useless skill hope you enjoyed 
it please like and subscribe and i'll see  
[00:22:26] you in the next video i'm out bye elsewhere 
out but i'm still here welcome to my channel


=== Getting Started With Memorizing Cards #Shorts ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5AdFSQeJjk

[00:00:00] so you want to learn how to memorize a
[00:00:01] deck of cards but don't know where to
[00:00:02] start easy first grab a deck of cards
[00:00:05] then take out the face cards you'll want
[00:00:06] to start with those that means jack
[00:00:09] queen king of each suits you should have
[00:00:11] 12 cards next assign a person to each of
[00:00:13] those cards best way to do this is by
[00:00:15] grouping the suits by categories for
[00:00:17] example maybe the diamonds are rich
[00:00:19] people hearts or family members spades
[00:00:21] or friends and clubs or athletes you can
[00:00:23] choose whatever you want then you can
[00:00:24] associate who you think is the king the
[00:00:26] queen or jack of said category once you
[00:00:28] have those chosen out think of a unique
[00:00:30] verb or action as well as an object for
[00:00:32] each one something that makes sense for
[00:00:33] the person now you can start memorizing
[00:00:35] shuffle the cards and then as you go
[00:00:37] through the cards imagine each set of
[00:00:39] three cards being its own memorable
[00:00:41] scene of someone doing some action with
[00:00:44] something
[00:00:45] once you have it in your mind imagine
[00:00:46] each of those scenes interacting with
[00:00:48] pieces of furniture in your house to
[00:00:50] remember the order then recite and
[00:00:52] impress your friends


=== 5 AWESOME 🧠 memory books you've probably never heard of! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhl1-vgQ1Nk

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:14] top
[00:00:16] [Music]
[00:00:26] what's up my friends what is up my
[00:00:29] friends so today we're in a little bit
[00:00:31] of a different situation here a little
[00:00:33] different setting this is my father's
[00:00:36] office i thought with all the books
[00:00:37] behind us we could talk about
[00:00:39] some books now i typically would
[00:00:42] probably gravitate to making a video
[00:00:44] about what my favorite memory books are
[00:00:46] to help you on your memory journey to
[00:00:49] memory mastery but i like to do things a
[00:00:51] little differently so in today's video
[00:00:54] we are going to talk about
[00:00:55] five books that are some of my favorite
[00:00:57] memory books but my favorite
[00:01:03] meaning they have something to do with
[00:01:05] memory and memory training but might not
[00:01:07] be the obvious picks for someone out
[00:01:08] there looking to improve their memory or
[00:01:11] to learn about memory all right so let's
[00:01:13] dive into it
[00:01:15] memory craft i have to give a little bit
[00:01:17] of a caveat here that this one is kind
[00:01:19] of paired with another called memory
[00:01:21] code all right written by the same
[00:01:23] author lynn kelly she wrote memory code
[00:01:25] first and then she wrote memory craft
[00:01:27] memory code is more about ancient
[00:01:29] indigenous tribes that use memory
[00:01:32] techniques specifically stories and
[00:01:34] memory palaces
[00:01:35] memory craft is more about
[00:01:37] basically how to harness the techniques
[00:01:40] while using some of the ancient
[00:01:42] techniques or ancient practices now what
[00:01:45] blows my mind is that
[00:01:48] i always thought that
[00:01:49] you know through my
[00:01:51] my so-called expertise i always thought
[00:01:53] that the memory palace technique started
[00:01:55] with the greeks and this famous story of
[00:01:58] simonides but that's not true it turns
[00:02:00] out that memory palace and telling
[00:02:02] stories
[00:02:04] is something that we have done as a
[00:02:06] species since the dawn of time you could
[00:02:09] argue that it is what makes us human
[00:02:11] anyways these books you can get really
[00:02:12] lost in the history of where these
[00:02:15] techniques come from let's step over
[00:02:17] here to talk about some of my favorite
[00:02:18] passages
[00:02:22] all right so uh one thing i got to show
[00:02:25] you guys
[00:02:27] check this out look at that guy that's
[00:02:29] me
[00:02:31] what a loser out of bart simpson shirt
[00:02:33] on and a sweet
[00:02:35] blonde bowl cut
[00:02:37] those were the days we're talking about
[00:02:38] memory crafts right and there's tons of
[00:02:40] stuff in here i don't even think i can
[00:02:42] cover it all but one part i wanted to
[00:02:44] read to you this is what we're doing in
[00:02:45] this video is i'm going to read you some
[00:02:47] passages so pay attention it's about the
[00:02:49] lacusa all right which is this basically
[00:02:51] a handheld memory palace and i think the
[00:02:54] idea of this is so
[00:02:57] cool you can make a memory palace out of
[00:03:00] anything and this is what the luba
[00:03:02] people in central africa they would make
[00:03:04] these things called lacusa's which were
[00:03:06] basically a piece of wood with shells on
[00:03:08] them that would basically be anchor
[00:03:10] points on a memory palace so let me read
[00:03:12] so here it's talking about how lynne
[00:03:14] kelly made her own lacusa so she's
[00:03:16] saying even with such an embarrassingly
[00:03:18] sloppy approach my first lacusa worked
[00:03:20] an absolute treat each bead needs to be
[00:03:23] distinctive so i strongly recommend
[00:03:25] using a variety of shapes and colors but
[00:03:27] there are ways to distinguish them even
[00:03:28] if you're using identical beads for
[00:03:30] example the grain of the wood around
[00:03:32] where you place each bead can be quite
[00:03:34] distinctive if you look closely on first
[00:03:36] glance you look at a lemon or a bar of
[00:03:38] soap or a piece of wood and you're like
[00:03:40] it's just one thing how can i memorize
[00:03:42] multiple things on it but if you look
[00:03:43] close you can see differences and it's
[00:03:45] those differences that you can use as
[00:03:47] markings or anchor points to help you
[00:03:49] remember other stuff the beads are also
[00:03:51] differentiated by those around them and
[00:03:53] the gaps between the spatial right each
[00:03:55] bead will have a different distance to
[00:03:57] the edge of the board so when you hold
[00:03:58] the board and touch the beads the
[00:04:00] positions of your hands will change all
[00:04:02] of that becomes valuable when adding
[00:04:03] meaning to apparently mundane objects
[00:04:06] the process of encoding knowledge to
[00:04:08] beads and shells and marks on a bit of
[00:04:10] wood will be very similar no matter what
[00:04:13] topic you choose for your memory board
[00:04:14] as soon as you have your information
[00:04:16] structured into some sort of order
[00:04:18] you're ready to go if you've watched any
[00:04:19] of my videos you kind of know what the
[00:04:21] next steps would be but i love this idea
[00:04:23] and i love it even further as a way to
[00:04:26] potentially memorize
[00:04:28] stories and memories in my life
[00:04:33] pretty good definitely worth it if
[00:04:35] you're going to choose one versus the
[00:04:36] other i would probably start with this
[00:04:39] one because what you'll get out of this
[00:04:40] one are the techniques as well actual
[00:04:43] practical techniques
[00:04:44] with a bit of the history and then if
[00:04:46] that really
[00:04:48] wets your whistle i would go and pick up
[00:04:50] memory code as well
[00:04:52] uncommon sense teaching by barbara
[00:04:54] oakley one of my favorite people on the
[00:04:56] planet i've done an interview with her
[00:04:59] many many years ago and i'm constantly
[00:05:02] trying to connect with her because she
[00:05:03] has such great ideas on the teaching
[00:05:05] side of things not so much memory
[00:05:08] techniques but teaching and learning she
[00:05:10] has a great course on coursera that she
[00:05:12] interviewed me for all about learning
[00:05:14] how to learn now for me the most
[00:05:16] important chapter or the most
[00:05:17] interesting to me and something that
[00:05:18] kind of was outside of stuff that i
[00:05:20] personally teach or talk about in depth
[00:05:24] with chapter six where it talks about
[00:05:25] procedural memory you know when i teach
[00:05:27] memory techniques it's a way to get
[00:05:29] information into your mind quickly but
[00:05:31] that is not procedural that's oftentimes
[00:05:33] is declarative although there's a catch
[00:05:35] right because when i memorize a deck of
[00:05:37] cards for example that is a declarative
[00:05:39] process right i memorize cards and then
[00:05:42] i pull it out and declare it out of my
[00:05:44] memory ace of hearts king of spades four
[00:05:46] of hearts but there is a procedural
[00:05:49] element to that too and by procedural
[00:05:51] you can think but probably the best way
[00:05:52] to think about it is muscle memory the
[00:05:55] things that are hardwired where you
[00:05:57] don't really have to think about it
[00:05:58] because it's a procedure it's just a
[00:06:00] part of you so when i memorize cards the
[00:06:02] process in which i do it because i've
[00:06:04] trained it so much and i've gotten so
[00:06:05] fast at it and create these images at a
[00:06:08] high speed it's kind of a procedural
[00:06:10] process that i've learned and so she
[00:06:12] talks about some techniques to get
[00:06:13] things into your procedural memory
[00:06:15] because that's that's the holy grail
[00:06:17] right forget my memory techniques that's
[00:06:19] cool if you can get information in your
[00:06:21] mind quickly but how do you get
[00:06:24] things into your long term
[00:06:26] memory or your procedural memory fast
[00:06:28] how do you hack that it's a fascinating
[00:06:30] read and a lot of really useful nuggets
[00:06:32] on teaching and learning both from the
[00:06:34] perspective of the student and from a
[00:06:36] person who teaches so definitely give
[00:06:39] this one a look let's check out some of
[00:06:40] my favorite passages
[00:06:42] over here
[00:06:45] so interleaving helps students learn
[00:06:46] virtually any subject including sports
[00:06:49] math music art and language even
[00:06:50] seemingly simple concepts such as
[00:06:52] learning to write different letters can
[00:06:54] benefit from interleaved rather than
[00:06:56] blocked practice interleaving may boost
[00:06:58] procedural memory because it gives
[00:07:00] students practice in picking up on
[00:07:02] patterns that is detecting the subtle
[00:07:04] difference between somewhat similar
[00:07:06] items or techniques so for example think
[00:07:08] of the difference between that and
[00:07:10] declarative learning where you learn a
[00:07:11] list right you may have it all in your
[00:07:13] memory and it may be very impressive
[00:07:15] that you know all this stuff
[00:07:16] but that's kind of like where it ends
[00:07:18] especially when you first learn it
[00:07:20] declaratively is you just know it which
[00:07:22] can be useful don't get me wrong when
[00:07:23] you know it right and it's procedural
[00:07:25] it's built into you right
[00:07:28] this kind of muscle memory idea
[00:07:30] you almost are removed from the
[00:07:32] declarative process
[00:07:34] and can then focus on the bigger picture
[00:07:36] sometimes people ask me like what's the
[00:07:38] point of practicing your memory or or
[00:07:40] studying something and memorizing it and
[00:07:42] reviewing it over and over well it's
[00:07:44] precisely this to be able to notice
[00:07:46] patterns and that's why memory is so
[00:07:48] important because
[00:07:50] if you practice memorizing a lot and you
[00:07:53] memorize a lot of things and you have it
[00:07:55] up here yeah you could look it up on
[00:07:56] google yeah you could put it in your
[00:07:57] phone and that's probably a load off
[00:07:59] your mind but you're removing the
[00:08:01] possibility of being able to just
[00:08:04] notice patterns what are what patterns
[00:08:06] are you trying to notice who knows right
[00:08:08] you can't predict that you can't say
[00:08:09] that but
[00:08:10] things may arise and you'll be like oh
[00:08:12] man i only knew that because i know so
[00:08:14] many of my phone numbers or because i
[00:08:15] know so many things that i've studied
[00:08:17] and studied them and kept them in my
[00:08:19] mind
[00:08:21] yup
[00:08:22] good stuff
[00:08:24] all right this one is a curious book
[00:08:27] i don't even remember
[00:08:29] where i found it but it's called i
[00:08:31] remember
[00:08:32] and it's not a memory training book or
[00:08:35] technique book per se literally the
[00:08:38] premise of this book i think it was
[00:08:39] written in the 60s or the 70s let me
[00:08:41] check yeah in the mid 70s it literally
[00:08:43] is just
[00:08:44] paragraph after paragraph
[00:08:46] starting with the two words i remember
[00:08:50] and it's this author's attempt to
[00:08:52] just write down instances of things that
[00:08:55] he remembered for example
[00:08:58] i remember the day marilyn monroe died
[00:09:00] something as simple as that
[00:09:02] also here i remember a red car coat
[00:09:06] i don't know what that means for him but
[00:09:07] clearly that's a memory of his right
[00:09:10] here's another one i remember a big
[00:09:12] black cat named midnight who got so old
[00:09:14] and grouchy that my parents had him put
[00:09:16] to sleep you know and when i first found
[00:09:18] this book
[00:09:19] you know i fell in love with the premise
[00:09:21] of it and i started doing this for
[00:09:23] myself
[00:09:24] you know there's so many moments in the
[00:09:25] day where suddenly i'm like oh for
[00:09:27] whatever reason whether i'm reminded of
[00:09:28] it or it's just my mind it just pops up
[00:09:31] in my mind something i remember whether
[00:09:32] it's from a recent occurrence or from my
[00:09:35] childhood or
[00:09:37] from just a few years ago
[00:09:39] and then it's gone right sometimes i
[00:09:40] spend more time thinking about it but
[00:09:42] most times it just disappears and i made
[00:09:44] a pact to myself that anytime i remember
[00:09:47] something i have to write it down well i
[00:09:49] give it some love first i think about it
[00:09:50] and then i write it down and now i have
[00:09:52] a document where i just have all these
[00:09:54] little paragraphs of i remember and they
[00:09:57] don't have to be
[00:09:58] flushed out you know it can be as simple
[00:10:00] as i remember you know my little yorkie
[00:10:04] teacup yorkie named fifi and that's it
[00:10:06] yes we did have a yorkie named fifi for
[00:10:08] me it's just about writing down the
[00:10:09] memory and now i have this whole catalog
[00:10:12] of instances that i remember they're not
[00:10:14] organized they're not in chronological
[00:10:16] order they just are and it's a great way
[00:10:18] to kind of let the flying thoughts of
[00:10:21] your memory in your mind come to life
[00:10:24] and sit somewhere that you can come back
[00:10:26] and appreciate at a later time cool
[00:10:28] right
[00:10:29] now this one i already did a few
[00:10:30] examples um but let me read a few
[00:10:32] because it's a weird concept right to
[00:10:34] just put your own
[00:10:35] things that you remember from your own
[00:10:37] life and the author clearly lived in a
[00:10:39] different era than i did clearly live a
[00:10:42] different life
[00:10:43] all that stuff but somehow you read
[00:10:45] these and
[00:10:46] not all of them but most of them
[00:10:48] resonate i mean this one on the cover
[00:10:50] right here
[00:10:51] i remember the sound of the ice cream
[00:10:53] man coming
[00:10:55] don't we all
[00:10:57] it's just that simple sentence brings
[00:10:59] you right back here's another one i
[00:11:01] remember at least once only pretending
[00:11:03] to make a wish before blowing the
[00:11:05] candles out
[00:11:08] right right this is a simple memory but
[00:11:10] we all can relate to that right you're
[00:11:12] staring at your your cake your birthday
[00:11:14] cake whether you're 10 11 12 years old
[00:11:16] 15 38 and somebody says make a wish and
[00:11:20] you're kind of like
[00:11:21] man i don't know what i'm gonna wish for
[00:11:23] but i'm gonna pretend like i'm wishing
[00:11:24] for something and then finally i
[00:11:26] remember a boy who could swing down a
[00:11:28] coke in one big gulp followed by a long
[00:11:30] loud belch i feel like everybody had
[00:11:33] that kid in their fourth grade class
[00:11:35] yeah cameron cameron was that guy huge
[00:11:38] huge burps huge burps
[00:11:43] oh that's a good one
[00:11:45] now this book
[00:11:47] is super interesting to me it's pretty
[00:11:49] recent it's from 2020 written by anthony
[00:11:51] mettevier a lot of you watching my video
[00:11:53] may know him he's got a really great
[00:11:56] youtube channel i'll link it up above
[00:11:58] here
[00:11:59] and in the description and he's got his
[00:12:01] own course and all that stuff and he's
[00:12:03] he puts out really well thought out
[00:12:05] very thorough information about
[00:12:08] memory techniques and his book the
[00:12:10] victorious mind how to master memory
[00:12:12] meditation and mental well-being and i
[00:12:14] love it because it touches on things
[00:12:16] that you won't get from any other memory
[00:12:18] book especially the mindfulness aspect
[00:12:21] of it it's a really big part of being a
[00:12:23] well-practiced
[00:12:25] memorizer or person with a good memory
[00:12:28] is being in tune with your thoughts and
[00:12:31] being able to quiet out the
[00:12:33] noise to help your mental health and to
[00:12:36] help you memorize better i mean he's got
[00:12:38] chapters this this chapter right
[00:12:40] breathing walking remembering meditative
[00:12:42] journaling navigating your way to
[00:12:44] commercies memory palaces of course
[00:12:47] learning mindfulness by memorizing names
[00:12:49] i love that
[00:12:50] and then bringing it all together yeah a
[00:12:52] lot of stuff in here you know it's it's
[00:12:54] something that's i think more of a
[00:12:55] classical approach thinking back on the
[00:12:58] ancients and how they use memory
[00:13:00] techniques and how it wasn't just about
[00:13:02] oh i can memorize this i can memorize
[00:13:04] that it's really about having this
[00:13:07] mastery over your mind
[00:13:09] so for the victorious mind i mean
[00:13:11] there's a lot in here and a lot of it is
[00:13:13] about memory techniques which i don't
[00:13:14] need to go into but i really like the
[00:13:16] overall message of this book which is
[00:13:18] trying to develop this victorious mind
[00:13:20] which is basically as he summarizes in
[00:13:22] the end here
[00:13:24] that it's almost this goal of having
[00:13:26] absence of thoughts but not quite
[00:13:29] right so he writes here yet as i hope to
[00:13:32] have shown in this book the absence of
[00:13:33] thoughts is not the goal of a victorious
[00:13:35] mind that wants to learn remember and
[00:13:37] participate in the world at the highest
[00:13:39] possible levels given the circumstances
[00:13:40] at hand the world operates using many
[00:13:43] words and this isn't going to change
[00:13:44] anytime soon even if achieving no mind
[00:13:47] is your goal
[00:13:49] thought
[00:13:50] as much as anything else is what is
[00:13:52] likely to get you there and he ends on
[00:13:54] this quote here by wei wu way i don't
[00:13:57] know what that is but why are you so
[00:13:59] unhappy because 99 of what you think and
[00:14:02] everything you do is for yourself
[00:14:05] and there isn't one
[00:14:09] i can relate because
[00:14:11] when training memory right which is such
[00:14:13] obviously a
[00:14:15] thoughtful process it's all about
[00:14:17] thought it's happening up here in your
[00:14:19] thoughts when you get really good at
[00:14:21] memorizing things there comes an
[00:14:22] effortless feeling sometimes when you're
[00:14:25] memorizing the best when you're in the
[00:14:27] zone
[00:14:28] and it's when you're not thinking really
[00:14:30] hard to describe when you memorize the
[00:14:33] best
[00:14:34] and i think that's that no mind kind of
[00:14:36] idea that he's talking about is where
[00:14:38] you're obviously thinking but you're not
[00:14:40] necessarily thinking about the thinking
[00:14:43] well worth the read love this book
[00:14:46] now this one my friends is honestly the
[00:14:49] best
[00:14:50] book i've read in recent years possibly
[00:14:52] one of the best non-fiction books i've
[00:14:54] ever read mostly because it's the most
[00:14:56] useful and this book is called story
[00:14:58] worthy engage teach persuade and change
[00:15:01] your life through the power of
[00:15:02] storytelling by matthew dicks on first
[00:15:04] glance you might be like well i didn't
[00:15:06] even hear the word memory entitled like
[00:15:08] what does this have to do with memory
[00:15:10] and in fact yeah i don't even know how
[00:15:12] many times the word memory if at all
[00:15:14] comes up in this book
[00:15:15] but it's all about memory technically
[00:15:17] what this book is about is how to tell a
[00:15:19] story in an engaging
[00:15:21] and memorable way we are hardwired to
[00:15:24] tell stories it's what we've done since
[00:15:25] the dawn of time since our very
[00:15:27] existence and so telling stories is what
[00:15:30] we do
[00:15:31] it's how we connect with people it's how
[00:15:33] we pass information along
[00:15:35] and the goal of stories is to make them
[00:15:38] memorable you want your stories to stick
[00:15:41] and for people to
[00:15:43] listen to them and to appreciate them
[00:15:45] and to maybe even tell those stories to
[00:15:46] other people but can't do that if they
[00:15:48] don't remember it right so this book is
[00:15:50] all about the techniques and strategies
[00:15:53] as if it were you know training for a
[00:15:55] memory competition to be honest uh how
[00:15:57] do you tell an engaging story what are
[00:15:59] the hacks what does the story look like
[00:16:01] how do you make it engaging and
[00:16:02] memorable
[00:16:04] matthew dix is a 36 time
[00:16:07] moth story slam champion
[00:16:09] and five-time grand slam champion i
[00:16:11] don't even know what that means other
[00:16:12] than there are storytelling
[00:16:14] championships and he's won them this
[00:16:16] book gives you real actionable items on
[00:16:19] how to basically develop
[00:16:21] a catalog of stories you can tell
[00:16:24] in a speech
[00:16:25] at the bar
[00:16:26] around friends with someone you're
[00:16:28] dating and all in a way that makes it
[00:16:29] more memorable it's it's absolutely
[00:16:31] amazing i love this idea of
[00:16:35] what a story is like what is a good
[00:16:37] story all right what is a memorable
[00:16:39] story and he starts with this right and
[00:16:41] i've read this in another book which
[00:16:42] i'll quote as well your story must
[00:16:44] reflect change over time a story cannot
[00:16:47] simply be a series of remarkable events
[00:16:49] you must start out as one version of
[00:16:52] yourself and end as something new the
[00:16:54] change can be infinitesimal it need not
[00:16:56] reflect an improvement in yourself or
[00:16:58] your character but change must happen
[00:17:01] even the worst movies in the world
[00:17:02] reflect some change in a character over
[00:17:04] time and it reminds me of my
[00:17:08] climbs sometimes when i don't summit you
[00:17:10] know you come back all dejected and
[00:17:13] feel like a failure
[00:17:15] but
[00:17:16] what i always try to focus on is the
[00:17:18] change that it's caused right um i
[00:17:22] believe in one of my like when i came
[00:17:24] back from everest last time i thought i
[00:17:26] encapsulated this pretty well in one of
[00:17:28] my posts i'm gonna read it here as
[00:17:30] self-serving as this is
[00:17:32] uh let me find it
[00:17:34] there we go this was before i went for
[00:17:36] the summit many of you have asked why
[00:17:38] i'm doing this especially now after
[00:17:39] having failed to reach the summit so
[00:17:41] many times now with family etc i've had
[00:17:43] a hard time putting it into words but i
[00:17:45] think this is close to it i read
[00:17:46] somewhere that quote unquote a story is
[00:17:49] a character that wants something and
[00:17:50] overcomes conflict to get it
[00:17:53] close quote
[00:17:55] simple as that that is a story and that
[00:17:57] is what makes a story memorable making
[00:18:00] change the person is different from the
[00:18:01] start and the end i think that concept
[00:18:03] if you ever want to tell a story
[00:18:06] is just groundbreaking because if you
[00:18:08] miss that element your story sucks and
[00:18:10] will not be remembered now i didn't sum
[00:18:12] it so the next post was like sometimes
[00:18:14] the story we're after isn't the story we
[00:18:16] necessarily get or expect okay nice turn
[00:18:19] around nelson if you wanna have a
[00:18:20] memorable story think of the change from
[00:18:22] the beginning of the story you wanna
[00:18:24] tell and the end if there is none then
[00:18:26] it's just a remarkable series of events
[00:18:28] it's not a story
[00:18:32] all right that's it uh five of my
[00:18:34] favorite non-obvious memory books and uh
[00:18:38] i hope some of those seem pretty
[00:18:39] enticing to you and i would encourage
[00:18:41] you going out and reading them i'll put
[00:18:42] the link of all the titles and authors
[00:18:45] and some of their extra resources in the
[00:18:47] description below and please give them
[00:18:49] some love go check them out that's all
[00:18:50] for this video nothing more nothing less

=== Moonwalking With Joshua Foer (Interview) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JMRU2bgnOo

[00:00:00] So it's March 12
[00:00:01] in 2011
[00:00:02] And this will be the day
[00:00:03] that I win my first memory championship.
[00:00:06] It's also coincidentally
[00:00:08] the same week that Joshua Foer's
[00:00:10] Moonwalking with Einstein book
[00:00:12] comes out, hits the shelves
[00:00:14] and... becomes a bestseller.
[00:00:16] Now I have always attributed his book
[00:00:18] to kind of amplifying my success
[00:00:21] that year and subsequent years.
[00:00:23] So I owe a lot to Josh and his book
[00:00:25] coming out at that time.
[00:00:27] Now, fun little fact.
[00:00:28] I actually found a pre-print copy
[00:00:30] of three months before it came out.
[00:00:33] So I got to read that book
[00:00:34] in advance before winning my championship.
[00:00:37] And it definitely hyped me up
[00:00:38] It definitely... got me pumped up
[00:00:40] and ready to really try to win
[00:00:41] my first championship.
[00:00:43] Now, for me it wasn't the first book
[00:00:44] that got me into memory techniques
[00:00:46] but for a lot of people
[00:00:47] that come to my channel,
[00:00:48] lot of you guys,
[00:00:49] it was the first entry way
[00:00:51] to memory techniques and the..
[00:00:53] world of the art of memory.
[00:00:55] So I've always wanted to interview Josh
[00:00:56] and it's hard to get a hold of him
[00:00:58] but he finally agreed to do
[00:00:59] an interview with me.
[00:01:00] And here it is.
[00:01:01] I just wanted to share it with you.
[00:01:03] I hope you enjoy it.
[00:01:04] Ladies and gentlemen, Joshua Foer.
[00:01:06] Hey Josh, how you doin'?
[00:01:07] Nelson, it is good to see you man.
[00:01:09] Good to see you.
[00:01:10] Yeah, we were, just a second ago,
[00:01:11] trying to remember the last time
[00:01:13] ...umm
[00:01:14] jogging our memories when
we saw each other.
[00:01:16] What is it for you?
What do you remember the last time?
[00:01:17] Well you sent me a copy
of your kids book.
[00:01:20] That's true.
[00:01:21] - Yeah.
- But it wasn't a physical interaction.
[00:01:23] No but I felt like I was
in the room with you
[00:01:26] when I was reading it.
[00:01:27] So yeah.
- Nice.
[00:01:27] And by the way,
[00:01:28] it- it's a great book.
[00:01:30] Thank you. I am glad you read it.
The kids one, right?
[00:01:33] Yeah.
[00:01:33] Nice.
[00:01:34] Oh, that's awesome.
[00:01:35] Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:35] Did you happen to
give it to your kid?
[00:01:37] I'm curious.
[00:01:38] Uhh, not yet.
[00:01:39] But I should
[00:01:40] Yeah, I think the 9-year-old
[00:01:41] would be right at the good
[00:01:43] time. Maybe, I don't know
how as good as reading
[00:01:45] as I would imagine.
It's pretty good.
[00:01:47] Yeah, you know it's interesting.
[00:01:48] Umm..
[00:01:50] I mean you are a parent.
[00:01:51] Like have you...
[00:01:53] What have you done with
your kids with...
[00:01:54] all this memory stuff.
[00:01:56] Uhh... not so much because
[00:01:58] our oldest who's three,
[00:02:00] Um... he is like crazy
[00:02:02] He goes all over the place.
[00:02:03] So to get him to focus
on something,
[00:02:05] it's tough.
[00:02:05] But
[00:02:07] I am always..
[00:02:08] We always sit him down
to tell him stories about
[00:02:10] about things we've done
[00:02:12] and he has got like this
really good memory
[00:02:14] for... things we've done
[00:02:16] and like every instance
of the time we went there.
[00:02:19] Just because of like- he's like,
[00:02:20] "Tell me the story of this.
Tell me the story of that."
[00:02:23] And it has kinda become
a tradition and
[00:02:25] he is good with numbers
and he can count
[00:02:27] and letters and alphabet-
he is really good so far.
[00:02:31] Yeah, I'm-
[00:02:33] So I'm like constantly
amazed at how
[00:02:36] good the memories of kids are.
[00:02:38] And I don't know if it's
because they are just like-
[00:02:42] They don't have that much stuff
to actually think about.
[00:02:44] Um..
[00:02:45] But like, the ability to
remember the words and books
[00:02:48] they like
[00:02:49] you know
[00:02:50] my illiterate, almost
5-year-old
[00:02:53] you know, like
I'm reading to and finish sentences.
[00:02:55] Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:56] Umm...
[00:02:57] But what I was actually asking
is like,
[00:02:59] have you taught your kids
any of these memory techniques?
[00:03:02] Not really. The only thing
I have kind of done-
[00:03:05] We have like this elmo
suitcase with letters.
[00:03:08] And behind the letter,
you take it out
[00:03:09] and there's like a picture of
a thing with that letter.
[00:03:12] Like- A is an apple.
V is a violin.
[00:03:15] And he knows those.
[00:03:16] And I was really excited
when he got that toy
[00:03:17] because it's essentially
a peg system.
[00:03:20] - ...You know.
- Right.
[00:03:21] Umm, so eventually..
[00:03:22] You know, when I say like
V, like violin.
[00:03:24] He can just picture the letter
[00:03:25] and the image that goes to it
and eventually he could
[00:03:27] associate something to it.
[00:03:29] But we haven't got
to that part yet.
[00:03:31] Yeah, I- So
[00:03:32] I haven't like really
spent any time teaching
[00:03:35] my eldest - almost 9.
[00:03:37] Oh no! He is 9.
[00:03:38] I haven't really spent
a lot of time teaching him
[00:03:40] memory techniques.
[00:03:41] I went in and talked to his
[00:03:43] like first grade class
or kindergarten class
[00:03:45] and the kids were just like-
[00:03:47] I was taking it off the walls
[00:03:49] And like, I don't know if they picked up
on it or not.
[00:03:52] But he goes to a school
that doesn't have tests.
[00:03:55] So it's like...
[00:03:57] I think when he is ready to
take his first real test
[00:04:01] I'd be like..
[00:04:03] Oh that makes this
way easier for you.
[00:04:07] Cause that's what I
always felt. I always felt like
[00:04:09] I...
[00:04:11] That's what I wish
I had learned.
[00:04:13] Me too.
[00:04:13] Memory techniques
what was like in school.
[00:04:14] You know...
- Yeah.
[00:04:15] Because...
[00:04:17] At least when we
were kids
[00:04:19] And I don't know if this is
true now for kids but
[00:04:22] we had to memorize a lot of stuff just to
[00:04:24] pass tests and...
[00:04:26] If you are gonna make kids do that,
you might as well
[00:04:28] teach them how to do it.
[00:04:30] ... as efficiently as possible.
[00:04:32] I know- I say that all the time.
[00:04:34] Given all these tasks from the start
and its memorization, you know like
[00:04:38] learn the alphabet,
learn your times tables
[00:04:40] Learn the presidents whatever...
[00:04:42] And then it's like-
No one gives you a primer
[00:04:44] on the thing up here.
[00:04:47] It should be like-
[00:04:48] wood shop 101
but like
[00:04:49] you know for memory- you know.
[00:04:51] But there should also be
more wood shop 101s in schools
[00:04:53] if you ask me
[00:04:54] Agreed.
[00:04:54] All those kind of classes
should exist more.
[00:04:58] You know- like how to saw
[00:05:00] how to cut wood
[00:05:01] and build stuff and
finance and all that stuff.
[00:05:03] What was the first one you--?
[00:05:04] - Saw, yeah.
- Oh, how to saw, yeah absolutely.
[00:05:08] So I'm gonna say
my memory of the last-
[00:05:11] Well I have two.
[00:05:12] Because we did a few little book tours.
I think we did three. - We did, yeah.
[00:05:14] I would trot you out
[00:05:16] so that I- the pressure
would be off of me
[00:05:18] Like, you came and did
a couple book events.
[00:05:22] And I didn't want to have to
be up there, like
[00:05:24] you know testing
my own memory
[00:05:26] and I knew that you
were like in great shape
[00:05:29] could do it
[00:05:30] and it would take
some of the pressure off me.
[00:05:31] You were a real- a real
mention about doing that with me.
[00:05:34] - Sure.
- No, I was happy too.
[00:05:35] You were just like,
"Go for it, Nelson."
[00:05:38] Yeah, I remember the one we did
at Boston? I think it was Boston.
[00:05:42] And Ed Cook was there
with his gang.
[00:05:45] And I'd never met him.
I had read about him in your book
[00:05:47] and I had seen videos on YouTube
and heard of his legendary
[00:05:52] ...things whatever.
[00:05:54] And it was just like-
I still remember that night.
[00:05:56] We went to dinner afterwards
[00:05:57] and I was just like
listening to all of you guys talk
[00:06:00] especially them.
[00:06:01] Just the wild ideas that were
bouncing around that room.
[00:06:03] That's like- his- him and his
friends were just like
[00:06:06] on another level
[00:06:08] of creativity.
[00:06:09] I'll never forget that.
[00:06:10] Yeah, he just turned 40
and I just missed his 40th birthday party
[00:06:13] which is like..
[00:06:15] Something he'll probably
never live down
[00:06:17] because he throws
some pretty awesome parties.
[00:06:19] Well, have you
seen his recent project?
[00:06:22] Uhh...
Which one?
[00:06:23] I think something about
virtual parties or something?
[00:06:26] Oh yeah, he was telling me
about that
[00:06:28] but I actually haven't checked it out.
[00:06:30] - But it sounds like something
- Yeah, I looked at it briefly
[00:06:33] but it's-
[00:06:34] I mean it's so totally
in-line with him
[00:06:36] and I imagine it will take off
[00:06:38] and I thought it was
such a clever idea.
[00:06:41] Now you should have him
on the podcast.
[00:06:44] I've tried. He's a slippery fish
sometimes.
[00:06:47] I gotta get him down. He'll
reply sometimes but-
[00:06:51] it's usually I ask him for an interview
[00:06:52] and he's like, "Hey, how you doing?"
and didn't answer the question
[00:06:55] Alright I'll tap him
on the shoulder if you want.
[00:06:57] I appreciate that.
[00:06:58] yeah.
[00:06:58] So, for most of my viewers,
[00:07:01] I would imagine they know
who you are.
[00:07:03] Even most of them might have
started in the memory world
[00:07:06] because of your book.
[00:07:07] But for those who
don't know
[00:07:09] can you give kind of your your short
synopsis, your story
[00:07:13] you've given it so
many times but
[00:07:14] No, I mean the story as it's relevant
 to this corner of the universe
[00:07:18] is that I was a journalist-
a science journalist
[00:07:21] went to go write a magazine story about
[00:07:24] the united states memory championships
[00:07:26] many many years ago now
[00:07:28] and got really into the idea of like
[00:07:31] I had never- I didn't even know that it was
possible to train your memory
[00:07:34] I'd never heard of ancient
mnemonic techniques and
[00:07:38] decided I would give it a try
[00:07:40] got sucked in to the world of memorizing
[00:07:44] and ended up competing in and
winning the US memory championships
[00:07:48] when you, Nelson Dellis were just a
we-taught in diapers I think
[00:07:52] - Just about so..
- Yeah.
[00:07:53] certainly I would have had no chance
[00:07:56] if uh the likes of you were on the
scene at that time
[00:07:59] Hey man, it was a progression.
[00:08:00] You know, like, you
set the stage
[00:08:02] for the years to
come after that
[00:08:04] now I'm- I feel like I'm you-
[00:08:06] for the people who are in the
competition now you know it's-
[00:08:09] I'm okay. I still
practice a lot.
[00:08:12] definitely not as much
as I use to. Even if I
[00:08:15] had the time to train like I did,
I don't know if I could
[00:08:17] keep up with the young guns, you know.
[00:08:20] Yeah, I mean I was just
watching um..
[00:08:22] the winter Olympics
or like bits and pieces of it
[00:08:26] and it is nice to remember
that like,
[00:08:29] in every single sport
[00:08:31] on planet earth
[00:08:33] like the people who are doing the
[00:08:35] color commentary for NBC today
[00:08:37] because they were the stars 20 years ago
[00:08:39] like cannot compete against the people
[00:08:41] who are doing it today because just
[00:08:44] humans just keep pushing
[00:08:46] the boundary of what's possible
[00:08:48] and in memory it's
been just insane.
[00:08:50] - Yeah, yeah.
- Totally insane.
[00:08:52] If you'd ask me
[00:08:53] whether the records
that exist today
[00:08:57] in competitive memorizing
would have been possible
[00:08:59] like
[00:09:00] possible
[00:09:01] not like, could I imagine?
[00:09:02] I would have said, "I don't
think they are humanly possible."
[00:09:06] And that was 10 years ago.
[00:09:08] Which makes me wonder
like what it's gonna look like
[00:09:10] 10 years from now.
[00:09:11] Yeah, because I say the same things
about the records.
[00:09:13] Now as wild as they are.
[00:09:16] It's like - how can you-
I don't think you-
[00:09:18] Yeah, but I know I am
going to be wrong.
[00:09:20] And...
[00:09:21] you know, it's just-
it's crazy how
[00:09:25] people just keep pushing
and also to think
[00:09:27] like imagine the Olympics, right?
[00:09:29] Or things that have money and
[00:09:31] and like exposure,
[00:09:33] prizes and stuff, like
super competitive fields, right?
[00:09:37] Memory sports isn't really.
[00:09:40] So if that was ever a thing
where it became
[00:09:42] or was brought to another level,
[00:09:44] all sorts of people would
be pushing to
[00:09:46] to push it even further
and faster you know?
[00:09:49] You can only imagine.
[00:09:50] But it does seem like
[00:09:51] the organization around it all
has like
[00:09:55] leveled up.
[00:09:56] I don't know..
Am I perceiving that correctly?
[00:10:00] I'd say so...
Umm..
[00:10:02] There's a bit of confusion.
[00:10:04] I think sometimes...
because there's still the classic
[00:10:08] WMC, the world memory championships
[00:10:10] with Ray Keane and
[00:10:11] uh, used to be Tony Buzan.
[00:10:13] ...no longer with us.
[00:10:14] or Dominic O'Brien
and Phil Chambers and all that.
[00:10:17] But yeah- So there's a few
different competitions going around
[00:10:20] and you know it's been
focused more on digital now.
[00:10:24] It had to be, right? In the last
two years specially or so..
[00:10:27] I think that's really helped
kind of elevate it a little bit.
[00:10:30] And you know- It's been a-
There's a documentary that came out
[00:10:33] a couple of years ago in Netflix.
That was big
[00:10:36] And some of the people
[00:10:37] in this sport are really
[00:10:39] making good YouTube channels
and being on all these
[00:10:42] Netflix shows and so and so
and it's definitely
[00:10:45] come up a little bit.
[00:10:46] Do you have a...
[00:10:48] I know you are supposed
to be asking me the questions
[00:10:49] but you are so much closer to this
and I like- kind of wanna
[00:10:52] take the opportunity
to ask you
[00:10:53] but do you have a sense
of what it would take?
[00:10:56] Do you have an idea
for how you would get
[00:10:58] this whole competitive
universe to the next level?
[00:11:02] Man, I-
[00:11:04] Yeah, good question.
I tried...
[00:11:05] right.. Um..
[00:11:07] maybe I could have given it more of a go
[00:11:09] but back in 2014, 2015 and 16
[00:11:12] I had this extreme
memory tournament thing.
[00:11:15] You know, you were
on memory league
[00:11:16] for a championship
- yeah.
[00:11:19] I didn't know that
existed.
[00:11:22] And then when I was invited,
I went and researched it
[00:11:25] and did a little bit like-
[00:11:26] I was amazed! I thought
it was
[00:11:28] yeah!
[00:11:29] like
[00:11:32] It's phenomenal that has
come together.
[00:11:36] It was genuinely
gripping entertainment
[00:11:40] to like watch people struggling
and like..
[00:11:44] and the color commentary
and
[00:11:46] this is what I feel like
[00:11:49] people were just trying to do
[00:11:51] when I was- when I competed
[00:11:53] and...
[00:11:54] I competed the year
that it was filmed
[00:11:57] for HDnet.
[00:11:58] For Mark Cubain's like..
I don't even know if that still exists-
[00:12:01] cable channel.
[00:12:02] Yeah, I don't know.
[00:12:03] And I make fun of it in the book
[00:12:04] because it was like, they brought in
like a boxing commentator or something.
[00:12:08] and it was just
[00:12:09] like weird
[00:12:11] But I  felt like the
[00:12:13] the twitch stuff was really well done
[00:12:15] and like I could imagine wanting to
[00:12:17] watch that as just a
[00:12:21] like somebody who didn't know
what was going on.
[00:12:23] Yeah, yeah. So that's
[00:12:24] that's really come up. And
[00:12:26] and you know that started so I 
helped kind of grow the
[00:12:28] the software behind it.
[00:12:30] Memory league used to be
this extreme memory tournament
[00:12:32] like the software side.
[00:12:34] You know, I remember talking
to Ray Keane
[00:12:36] at a championship in 2010
and I was like - I have this idea!
[00:12:40] What if we have like tennis 
match style memory competitions
[00:12:43] you know where it was one-on-one.
[00:12:45] you go back and forth or like you know
[00:12:47] you both have to memorize something and
whoever gets the most
[00:12:49] in a certain amount-
short amount of time
[00:12:51] and he was like, "Yeah.. Maybe.."
You know he was
[00:12:54] they had a lot of those classic guys
[00:12:56] have a problems seeing past- 
what they've done
[00:12:59] you know so classically
and formally in for 20 years
[00:13:03] But eventually I teamed
with a guy from Australia
[00:13:05] A champion- memory champion
from there
[00:13:07] He was a developer so he and I
[00:13:10] uh kind of put it together I thought of
[00:13:12] the format and the structure
[00:13:14] and he built the code and then 
we had a sponsor in San Diego
[00:13:17] and ran this competition.
[00:13:18] And it was really cool.
[00:13:20] We invited people from everywhere
[00:13:22] and had prize money.
It was awesome.
[00:13:24] And for a second I was like, "This is 
the future.
[00:13:26] This is gonna be what we do every year. 
It is going to be huge.
[00:13:29] and then this sponsor fizzled out
[00:13:31] They actually went bankrupt.
[00:13:34] But memory league lived on
[00:13:36] and I think through the pandemic
[00:13:38] it's just kind of really grown and then
[00:13:40] Johannes has this Twitch channel
[00:13:42] that really has
[00:13:43] shown-
[00:13:44] you know- what it could look like
[00:13:45] as what you were saying.
[00:13:46] Kind of this boxing arena thing
but in a cool way.
[00:13:49] And yeah, I think that's-
that's hopefully the future.
[00:13:53] I don't know if it is enough
to have just like
[00:13:55] the five tests, right?
[00:13:57] Umm.. But definitely 
the platform
[00:14:00] from there I think
could be the answer.
[00:14:03] Yeah.
[00:14:03] Yeah.
[00:14:04] Oh! It's amazing to watch.
[00:14:06] just like how far it has come.
[00:14:08] That's good. That's really 
nice to hear from you.
[00:14:11] From a former competitor.
[00:14:13] which leads me to the question.
Do you ever-
[00:14:16] go back and kind of like
[00:14:18] say, "Yeah, let me see.
Can I still memorize some cards or...
[00:14:21] Sure.
[00:14:21] Uh...
[00:14:22] I haven't tried to do cards in 
a while
[00:14:24] but I am constantly trying
with numbers or
[00:14:29] -not constantly..
[00:14:31] No. The truth is..
[00:14:33] The truth is- 
I like, use the numbers
[00:14:36] in everyday life.
[00:14:37] I don't think I have tried
to do like hundred
[00:14:39] digits or thousand digits
in quite a long time.
[00:14:43] um...
[00:14:46] I...
[00:14:49] Yeah, I haven't really 
pushed myself lately.
[00:14:51] But I mean like- I don't know.
[00:14:53] I gotta- I am a parent 
with young kids.
[00:14:55] I have pushed myself
in a lot of ways recently
[00:14:57] as I am sure you can relate to.
[00:14:59] So you..
[00:15:01] you know, you stumbled on this
[00:15:03] what in 2005?
[00:15:04] Yeah.
- Was that the year?
[00:15:05] And your job I guess
[00:15:07] was then or is still now 
to be finding interesting stories
[00:15:10] and kind of immerse yourself.
[00:15:12] And that's just sounded super cool
[00:15:14] to you or maybe even 
felt like
[00:15:16] you could apply to your life
and actually be benefited.
[00:15:19] But did you-
[00:15:19] going into it, did you
always kind of think like
[00:15:22] this is a phase. Let me just
try my best to win it
[00:15:25] and then that will be that 
chapter of my life to move on.
[00:15:28] Or did you..
[00:15:31] Did I ever entertain
the possibility of like-
[00:15:33] keeping going?
[00:15:35] Yeah.
[00:15:35] Yes.
[00:15:37] After I won,
I was like, "Oh my God!"
[00:15:40] And...
[00:15:43] And then I did go 
to the world championship
[00:15:46] But after that I had a decision
to make.
[00:15:49] about whether I would like..
[00:15:51] go back and try 
and defend my title.
[00:15:53] Or just like hang up my cleats.
[00:15:54] And...
[00:15:58] I think I realized
[00:15:59] that the amount of work
it would take
[00:16:03] take like- to go 
from where I was
[00:16:06] to the place where I-
[00:16:08] When did you come on the scene?
[00:16:09] A year after me?
Or two years after me?
[00:16:11] 2009..
[00:16:13] It was my first.
[00:16:14] Okay. So wasn't that long.
[00:16:16] But I think maybe..
[00:16:17] Probably Ron White came back 
in one of the time or two after me
[00:16:23] ...I always - It was
the year after actually.
[00:16:25] Okay. Yeah.
[00:16:27] I always sort of felt 
like it was a fluke.
[00:16:30] ...like it was a fluke.
[00:16:31] You know.. like
[00:16:32] I had gotten extremely lucky
[00:16:34] and... uh
[00:16:38] yeah.. I- I- you know.
[00:16:40] I figured- better spend my time
[00:16:41] telling the story than trying to
[00:16:44] hang on to being in it.
[00:16:45] You know..
- Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:46] And it's like..
Anytime-
[00:16:48] A good story's gotta have 
a beginning and an end.
[00:16:49] And..
[00:16:54] Because I had approached it
[00:16:56] the whole thing- 
this whole world of memorizing from
[00:17:02] the position of like trying to understand
and wanting to tell a story about it
[00:17:07] I found the perfect ending to my story
[00:17:09] And...
[00:17:10] Being able to tell the best story
kind of required me
[00:17:13] to...
[00:17:16] let the story end.
[00:17:17] And sometimes it is hard to do
[00:17:18] when you're..
[00:17:21] in all reporting, right? Like..
[00:17:26] Figuring out like
when do I have enough
[00:17:29] and when is it the moment
to move on.
[00:17:33] It was a hard decision to make
[00:17:34] with the memorizing stuff
but it actually
[00:17:38] in retrospect I feel 
very good about it.
[00:17:39] And specially knowing
[00:17:42] how fast the sport 
was going to advance.
[00:17:45] I don't know if I could
have kept up.
[00:17:46] No- I definitely..
[00:17:48] It feels like
[00:17:49] you know.. the proper seinfeld move.
[00:17:52] You know, you kind 
of closed
[00:17:54] the end of the season
[00:17:55] You know when you should have
[00:17:57] - before you jump the shark.
[00:17:58] - Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:00] But do you ever wonder like..
if- if
[00:18:01] you say you
are lucky that year..
[00:18:03] I can argue that some of my wins
were lucky too.
[00:18:05] There's a lot of luck at the US..
- There's a lot of luck at the end.
[00:18:08] Would you still have- Do you think 
you would have written the book?
[00:18:13] Do you think 
it would have come out
[00:18:14] of you.. you know?
[00:18:15] I don't know.
[00:18:16] I mean took me a while
also to finish the book.
[00:18:18] Even after 2006 or whatever.
[00:18:22] But that's my own..
[00:18:25] slowness as a writer.
[00:18:27] Um...
[00:18:29] Yeah.. I don't know. I actually don't spend 
a lot of time entertaining
[00:18:32] that like alternative
[00:18:33] that alternative history.
[00:18:35] You know where I..
kept going with it.
[00:18:38] Can I ask what you
are working on now?
[00:18:39] Or what.. Have you
been working on?
[00:18:41] I always have a bunch 
of things going on at once.
[00:18:45] I'll tell you what's taken up
a lot of my time right now.
[00:18:46] It's atlas obscura.
[00:18:47] Which is a company that
I started.
[00:18:53] Just around the time
that I was finishing
[00:18:55] moonwalking with Einstein
[00:18:56] and..
[00:18:57] it's- so it's now been around
for over a decade
[00:19:00] and it's kind of just like
[00:19:02] growing and growing
and growing nicely and
[00:19:04] it's turned into
and amazing
[00:19:07] like
[00:19:08] a company with a lot of people.
[00:19:10] And... um
[00:19:13] and it's become a fun way
[00:19:15] to...
[00:19:16] express
[00:19:18] ideas with the
[00:19:21] had a look at the world
[00:19:22] and had to be in the world that
[00:19:25] previously I was trying to find
ways to express through
[00:19:28] my journalism.
[00:19:29] And now there's like a whole enterprise 
with a whole lot of people who are like
[00:19:32] together.. collectively
[00:19:35] expressing those ideas.
[00:19:36] And so that's been
very very satisfying.
[00:19:38] And then on the- 
On like books,
[00:19:40] - Why is..
- I know you were working on a book
[00:19:42] - Yeah, it's almost done.
[00:19:43] Yeah, it's almost done.
- The same one! It's almost done.
[00:19:45] I was like- - I take a while!
[00:19:48] No, I didn't give up on it.
[00:19:49] The truth is-
I put in on the back burner
[00:19:52] for a little bit during COVID
[00:19:54] and...
[00:19:55] Actually starting
a little bit before COVID
[00:19:57] because I had some other stuff
I had to focus on.
[00:19:58] And...
[00:20:00] But it also backwards.
[00:20:02] It's on the
[00:20:03] It's cooking right now.
[00:20:04] So... stay tuned for that.
[00:20:06] Can you talk about it?
Can you give the premise?
[00:20:08] ... Or no?
- The premise is
[00:20:10] you know, I spent
a bunch of time
[00:20:13] in.. now, a number of years ago
[00:20:17] living with or spending time with
[00:20:20] some of the..
[00:20:22] last
[00:20:23] hunter-gatherers
[00:20:24] on the planet. And you say last-
It's kind of loaded.
[00:20:27] Sure.
[00:20:28] But um..
[00:20:29] People who are still
[00:20:31] basically more or less
[00:20:33] making their livelihoods
the way
[00:20:36] most of humanity did
[00:20:37] for most of the time 
that human beings have been around.
[00:20:40] And...
[00:20:43] and so that was in Central Africa
[00:20:45] That's where I did that reporting.
[00:20:46] And.. went back and forth..
[00:20:48] 7 times to Central Africa
a number of years
[00:20:51] and...
[00:20:55] yeah, hopefully very soon
we'll have like a finished
[00:20:59] glock.
[00:20:59] I remember kind of following along.
[00:21:01] I don't know if you had
[00:21:02] a blog or something
at a point.
[00:21:03] But I know you were
trying to use memory techniques
[00:21:05] for some of the language learning.
[00:21:07] Oh yeah! No, that-
that was a major
[00:21:12] major way in which
memory techniques helped me
[00:21:14] in like
[00:21:16] not to win anything.
It's just like in real life.
[00:21:19] Cause I...
[00:21:21] this is a very- it was in
many ways a unique situation.
[00:21:23] The language that
I needed to learn
[00:21:26] is called Lingala.
[00:21:28] It's the national language
of Congo.
[00:21:30] And...
[00:21:31] it's a trade language.
[00:21:32] So
[00:21:34] What does that mean?
[00:21:35] It means like...
It's.. um
[00:21:38] it means that it was basically created
[00:21:40] I don't know if you would 
say inorganically
[00:21:42] but like it was
[00:21:44] it was a language that arose
from a bunch of people
[00:21:47] speaking different languages
[00:21:49] needing to communicate with each other.
[00:21:51] And.. So it's a simple language
[00:21:54] in terms of the size of the vocabulary
[00:21:56] It's a simple language in terms
of the regularity of the grammar
[00:21:59] and..
[00:22:01] um
[00:22:02] the...
[00:22:03] as far as
[00:22:05] I know the best English 
Lingala dictionary that exists
[00:22:08] - has like 1100 words.
[00:22:09] And..
[00:22:10] so it's a small language.
[00:22:12] And
[00:22:13] so I used memory techniques
[00:22:16] and specifically
an app
[00:22:18] that Ed Cook helped develop
[00:22:21] called Memorize which 
has now moved
[00:22:23] become a language 
running out
[00:22:24] but it's moved in a 
somewhat different direction.
[00:22:26] I don't even know if you can still
 do anything of lingala through it.
[00:22:29] Umm...
[00:22:30] to use that app to
memorize the dictionary
[00:22:35] I can learn that
in an hour! You know..
[00:22:37] I mean, it's sorta
[00:22:38] umm..
[00:22:39] but
[00:22:40] obviously learning
[00:22:42] memorizing the dictionary is not 
the same thing as learning a language.
[00:22:44] Correct.
[00:22:45] But it is an amazing
[00:22:49] scaffolding
[00:22:51] to then actually learn a language with.
[00:22:53] Because you are just
going into
[00:22:56] with
[00:22:58] little bits of words
that you can
[00:23:00] you can kind of pick up
and you can start to put together
[00:23:03] and...
[00:23:05] it's funny.
I wouldn't have guessed that
[00:23:06] it would have been
as effective as it is
[00:23:08] as it was.
[00:23:10] I don't think- 
I am definitely not fluent
[00:23:12] in Lingala.
[00:23:13] But like-
[00:23:14] I can have a conversation
and I understand quite a bit.
[00:23:18] And that's- and that's-
I think ultimately because of
[00:23:22] having spent that time.
[00:23:23] So it actually when you
got there and started working with the
[00:23:27] the tribe..
Like it paid off.
[00:23:29] Oh yeah! I mean, it turns out
that like half of the words in that dictionary
[00:23:32] aren't actually 
words people use
[00:23:33] and so where did you learn that like
[00:23:36] that is uh- I came in speaking
like Shakespearean English or something
[00:23:39] You know like, "What 
planet are you from?
[00:23:41] Yeah, I had a similar experience.
[00:23:43] I went about learning Dutch
[00:23:45] two years ago.
[00:23:46] It's my mother's..
mother tongue.
[00:23:49] And I went about it kind of
similarly with an app learning
[00:23:52] like 2400 words
[00:23:56] just- that was all
I did first.
[00:23:58] What app did you use?
[00:23:59] It was an app called 'Drops'.
[00:24:01] ...There's a lot out there.
This one
[00:24:03] we kind of worked together
on a few projects
[00:24:06] But it's really simple.
It's really easy to use. It's like
[00:24:09] um..
[00:24:10] aesthetically pleasing and kind of gets
you playing the game which I think is
[00:24:14] anything with the language learning.
If you can just
[00:24:16] try to stick to it.
So anything that helps you kind of
[00:24:18] get back to it every single day
just for a few minutes.
[00:24:22] But it was interesting because
[00:24:24] you know, when I started 
doing lessons,
[00:24:26] like to learn the actual language
after I memorized all those words.
[00:24:29] I wasn't fluent at all.
[00:24:31] But it's exactly
what you said.
[00:24:32] It was a really good scaffolding
because I could pick up
[00:24:35] things and start to 
put pieces together without
[00:24:38] um.. knowing a lick
[00:24:40] in the language...
you know- how yo put a sentence together.
[00:24:42] And so, how is your Dutch now?
[00:24:44] Well, I haven't practiced much so...
[00:24:46] It's a bit weak but it's one of these 
things like I feel like I could just
[00:24:51] I have all my notes 
that I took and all
[00:24:54] the books that I use and the words..
the same app
[00:24:56] whatever.
[00:24:58] I think I could get it back
[00:24:59] quite quickly.
[00:25:00] I understand it still.
[00:25:02] And I can read it very well.
[00:25:04] But it's the.. coming up
with the words
[00:25:06] fast enough because if you're
not using them. I mean they're
[00:25:08] buried in there.
[00:25:09] If not they are falling out, you know.
[00:25:12] So.. yeah.
[00:25:14] Cool.
[00:25:16] Where can people
learn more about
[00:25:17] what you are doing these days?
[00:25:19] Go to Atlas Obscura
[00:25:20] Go to atlasobscura.com
[00:25:22] - Yeah.
- Yeah.
[00:25:25] Can you tell people
what that is quickly.
[00:25:27] Atlas Obscura is a guide
to the world's hidden wonders.
[00:25:31] So... um
[00:25:33] anywhere you're going in the world 
you want to wear really cool sh*t that
[00:25:36] nobody tells you about.
[00:25:37] This is where you find it.
[00:25:39] Do you have anything?
Cause I have a few.
[00:25:42] In Nepal, in the Himalayas
upto Mount Everest
[00:25:45] I am sure with you!
[00:25:46] But on the way upto Mount Everest?
[00:25:48] Yeah, like on the track.
Most people do to base camp.
[00:25:51] I don't know.
[00:25:51] I gotta go look
[00:25:52] but what have you got?
[00:25:53] Well, the main one that
would be definitely
[00:25:57] should be in your platform is
[00:25:59] is the Yeti Skull
[00:26:01] There's a...
[00:26:03] a monastery that
has a supposed Yeti
[00:26:06] ..skull or scalp.
- Did you see it?
[00:26:08] No, I..
[00:26:10] I have not.
[00:26:11] I have seen other people who have
stopped to take photos of it on my team
[00:26:15] but I never went by.
[00:26:17] It's supposed to be..
A bit of.. you know.
[00:26:20] Obviously it's not real but it's
[00:26:22] Some people think it's real but it's 
uh weird.
[00:26:24] What do we think it is?
[00:26:26] Someone said it's like part 
of a goat's scalp or something.
[00:26:29] I don't know. I don't know.
[00:26:30] Wasn't um...
[00:26:31] I think Edmund Hillary
[00:26:33] got really into looking
for the idiots.
[00:26:35] You are right. I think 
he claimed to have seen a footprints
[00:26:37] something weird like that
[00:26:39] but um...
[00:26:40] I never have.
[00:26:42] But if that's not it,
[00:26:43] you should look into that if that
or get somebody on it.
[00:26:45] Of all the crazy crap in the world
[00:26:47] that's when I am prepared 
to be like
[00:26:49] slightly open minded about.
[00:26:51] - You know..
- Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:53] Nice so...
everybody wants to
[00:26:56] learn some weird stuff
about the world -

=== Answering ALL your questions (Q&A 2022) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8sm_V1qoUY

[00:00:00] welcome guys it's been quite a while uh
[00:00:03] almost two years
[00:00:04] since i did my last q a and i would say
[00:00:07] that this channel has grown quite
[00:00:09] significantly since then
[00:00:11] beyond my wildest imaginations and
[00:00:14] dreams so first of all thank you you
[00:00:16] know this these videos are here to kind
[00:00:18] of help you get to know me a little
[00:00:19] better if you're interested i get tons
[00:00:22] of questions i don't always get to
[00:00:23] answer them in the comments so i figured
[00:00:26] let's let's dive deep and uh see what's
[00:00:29] in there no hesitations let's get right
[00:00:32] to the questions that you guys are so
[00:00:34] burning
[00:00:37] let's get to it shall we anwar says
[00:00:39] people paid a lot of money for this
[00:00:41] knowledge but you're giving it for free
[00:00:43] thanks dude you're awesome
[00:00:45] i know right not the awesome part but
[00:00:48] the the stuff about giving information
[00:00:50] knowledge for free yes i have a course
[00:00:52] which i charge for but i have a ton of
[00:00:56] content online and when people reach out
[00:00:58] to me and they're like where's the best
[00:00:59] place to start i say check out my free
[00:01:01] stuff because you can learn a lot
[00:01:04] from there alone and
[00:01:07] i plan on giving away a lot more
[00:01:09] knowledge out there granted my course
[00:01:12] itself does teach stuff in a more
[00:01:14] controlled you know step-by-step process
[00:01:17] but if you just want to kind of get the
[00:01:18] basics and some fun ideas that's what
[00:01:20] youtube's for and it is free someone
[00:01:23] asked has the us memory championship
[00:01:24] risen to the international standards yet
[00:01:27] the answer is
[00:01:31] it's still its own kind of pocket of the
[00:01:34] memory competition world
[00:01:36] doing its own thing it's run by a very
[00:01:39] small group of people and you know they
[00:01:41] do it
[00:01:42] out of tradition of how it's been in the
[00:01:44] us and they don't answer to the world
[00:01:47] memory sports council or international
[00:01:50] association of memory or whatever
[00:01:52] the europeans and the rest of the world
[00:01:54] basically abide by
[00:01:56] which isn't a bad thing that whole thing
[00:01:58] is kind of a disarray anyway so
[00:02:01] you know the us does their own thing and
[00:02:03] i like it did you get divine power
[00:02:07] no and as someone else pointed out uh in
[00:02:10] that video they're referencing bj shahi
[00:02:12] saying that he had divine power in the
[00:02:14] video where i interview him maybe the
[00:02:16] only divine power in that video was me
[00:02:18] and my patience for
[00:02:20] all of his [ __ ]
[00:02:23] sachin link link is my son's name uh he
[00:02:26] says hey mr dellis mr deslis what's your
[00:02:30] iq it's a good question i actually don't
[00:02:32] know i've never taken an iq test i think
[00:02:35] i've taken some kind of not real iq test
[00:02:38] online but that doesn't count i've never
[00:02:39] taken a proper one maybe i should do
[00:02:41] that that would be a cool video um yeah
[00:02:44] i wonder what it would be jeez is bj
[00:02:46] shahi alive or dead after i posted my
[00:02:49] video a lot of people were saying
[00:02:51] you know rip bj shahi and
[00:02:55] i paused for a moment i was freaked out
[00:02:57] that my video had caused
[00:02:59] some harm uh some serious harm
[00:03:02] but later on thankfully that day
[00:03:04] uh it was shown that he's actually alive
[00:03:06] um and
[00:03:07] i don't know if he staged his death or
[00:03:10] whatever this was it was the most absurd
[00:03:13] few hours of my life um having to worry
[00:03:16] about that from this scammer guy let's
[00:03:19] move on i don't want to talk about it
[00:03:20] sinx punishment says you speak too much
[00:03:23] yeah i do and i speak really fast so
[00:03:27] again
[00:03:28] if you don't like that then
[00:03:29] you can fast forward or watch another
[00:03:31] video
[00:03:33] by someone else madrix says dude you
[00:03:36] could be a great travel vlogger you're a
[00:03:38] great presenter you should try the
[00:03:39] travel food vlogs
[00:03:41] interesting and honestly that's what i
[00:03:43] kind of hoped to have done with my
[00:03:44] channel early on you'll see i did some
[00:03:46] little travel things there weren't
[00:03:48] really vlogs necessarily but
[00:03:50] there are people who do that way better
[00:03:52] than i do my philosophy is whenever i
[00:03:54] make a video if i want it to be about
[00:03:56] travel or if i want it to be about food
[00:03:58] i always think about it through the lens
[00:04:00] of how can i make this relevant to the
[00:04:02] mind or memory so you'll see i did once
[00:04:04] a
[00:04:05] video on food cooking food how to
[00:04:08] memorize a recipe i was on everest i
[00:04:10] didn't just want to do everest vlogs so
[00:04:12] i did stuff related to how to memorize
[00:04:14] things on the mountain that kind of
[00:04:16] thing i'm obsessed with memory and i'm
[00:04:18] glad i found nelson very helpful
[00:04:21] thank you i'm glad you found me too
[00:04:22] rohan here says i also have learned a
[00:04:25] thousand pi digits i am not joking oh i
[00:04:28] believe you wish i could hear your
[00:04:30] thoughts real time while doing this i
[00:04:32] forget which video this is from but um
[00:04:35] yeah ultimately you know when i'm
[00:04:37] memorizing stuff a lot is happening in
[00:04:38] my mind and i can't always vocalize what
[00:04:41] i'm doing but i guarantee you that
[00:04:43] what's going on up here is
[00:04:45] very strange
[00:04:47] possibly rated r rated x sometimes but
[00:04:50] yeah hey that's what makes it memorable
[00:04:52] carrion here asks but can you remember
[00:04:54] the usernames of all your subscribers
[00:04:56] believe it or not when i was about to
[00:04:58] hit 100 000 subscribers one of the ideas
[00:05:00] i had was to memorize
[00:05:03] some of my subscribers uh believe it or
[00:05:05] not their names uh i wasn't gonna do a
[00:05:07] hundred thousand that would have been an
[00:05:09] epic task for something that
[00:05:12] would have been useful for a video and
[00:05:13] that's it
[00:05:15] but i was thinking of maybe doing a
[00:05:16] thousand or something like that
[00:05:18] still an idea for the future would you
[00:05:19] recommend a speed reading a spread
[00:05:23] reading training app speedy reading
[00:05:24] training app no i would not just read
[00:05:27] the book with your eyes use your hands
[00:05:29] watch my video on how to read faster but
[00:05:30] the speed reading apps
[00:05:32] yeah no daniel flores says i don't
[00:05:34] understand why nelson doesn't have any
[00:05:35] more subscribers i find amazing his way
[00:05:39] of teaching about memory practical
[00:05:40] examples and warm personality thank you
[00:05:43] your time will come nelson thanks to for
[00:05:45] all your content by the way i read your
[00:05:47] book it's wonderful thank you thank you
[00:05:49] i appreciate that i don't know what it
[00:05:50] necessarily means when my time will come
[00:05:53] i i was happy to get 10 000 subscribers
[00:05:55] i was happy to even get 100 000 after
[00:05:58] that and now almost a quarter million
[00:06:01] like i almost feel like i don't even
[00:06:03] want to touch anything more because i
[00:06:05] like the fan base that i have i don't
[00:06:07] necessarily want it to be a million that
[00:06:09] seems really daunting and i don't think
[00:06:11] i deserve to have a million people watch
[00:06:14] my videos constantly that seems very
[00:06:16] strange i can't remember what i ate
[00:06:17] yesterday
[00:06:19] yeah uh probably me neither if i
[00:06:22] i can remember
[00:06:23] this guy says
[00:06:24] you looks like chuck norris
[00:06:27] okay but i don't know if that's a
[00:06:28] compliment or not but i'll take it
[00:06:30] kinda don't flash your credit card
[00:06:32] number at this guy this person says
[00:06:34] funny story uh i think i have a video
[00:06:37] i'm going to share it right here if i
[00:06:38] have it
[00:06:39] but basically back in the day when i had
[00:06:42] friends and i wasn't married with kids
[00:06:44] i'd go out believe it or not and
[00:06:47] one of my close friends diogo would
[00:06:49] always kind of hype me up and tell
[00:06:51] everybody about what i do the memory
[00:06:53] stuff because i never volunteered that
[00:06:54] information and we were at a restaurant
[00:06:56] everybody had just chipped in their
[00:06:58] credit cards there were 10 of us
[00:07:00] for a big bill
[00:07:01] and um
[00:07:03] diogo said hey to the manager if he
[00:07:05] could memorize all these credit cards
[00:07:06] would you give us the bill for free
[00:07:08] the manager was like yeah okay how much
[00:07:10] time do you want and he was like i'll
[00:07:12] give you five minutes i was thinking it
[00:07:13] was impossible but i was like this is
[00:07:16] actually pretty easy
[00:07:18] sure you want to do that anyways i did
[00:07:19] it and uh
[00:07:22] yeah we didn't get the bill for free the
[00:07:23] guy was like yeah i can't do that but he
[00:07:25] did give us free desserts do you have
[00:07:27] insta
[00:07:28] yes i do it's at n-e-l-z-o-r at melzor
[00:07:31] it's kind of going through an identity
[00:07:32] crisis i don't know whether to post
[00:07:34] stuff about mountains stuff about memory
[00:07:36] tips about memory or my life it's a bit
[00:07:38] of a smorgasbord of stuff right now
[00:07:40] thoughts on howard berg so i don't know
[00:07:43] enough about him
[00:07:45] to really say anything but i might
[00:07:47] investigate and maybe do a video on that
[00:07:49] you know my stance on speed reading and
[00:07:52] i've seen videos of him and he doesn't
[00:07:54] look like a scam but some of the things
[00:07:56] he says are a bit out of the ordinary
[00:07:59] allah bj
[00:08:01] i don't know i'd have to do more
[00:08:02] research to really understand maybe i
[00:08:04] can even try to interview him these
[00:08:05] comments are just so boring you don't
[00:08:07] need to write from nepal every time you
[00:08:08] say something
[00:08:10] yeah you do man i love hearing from my
[00:08:13] nepalese fanbase you guys have come in

[00:08:53] she is way better than me and an awesome
[00:08:56] memory champion
[00:08:57] i'll link her channel in the description
[00:08:59] give her some love she's got some great
[00:09:01] videos out there what's some of your
[00:09:02] favorite books
[00:09:04] that's a big question i did a video on
[00:09:05] that some of my favorite most
[00:09:07] influential books i'm gonna do another
[00:09:09] book on some of my favorite
[00:09:11] i'm gonna do another video on some of my
[00:09:13] favorite books uh so that'll come soon
[00:09:16] but man i like climbing books i like
[00:09:18] math books i like science books i read a
[00:09:20] ton of non-fiction the only fiction that
[00:09:22] i really read are
[00:09:24] you know fantasy books
[00:09:26] and i reread fantasy books so i'm always
[00:09:29] reading stuff by tolkien basically lord
[00:09:31] of the rings and game of thrones i've
[00:09:33] reread them so many times i really
[00:09:34] should try something new you could just
[00:09:36] use photoreading and read it in a day so
[00:09:39] i think this is a from my read a book in
[00:09:41] a day video photo reading though
[00:09:44] is complete garbage
[00:09:46] this is what it looks like
[00:09:48] [Music]
[00:09:54] i'm not even kidding so i might react to
[00:09:57] this in another video but uh it is not
[00:09:59] real how did you select the people
[00:10:01] corresponding with each three-digit
[00:10:03] sequence
[00:10:04] so in my memory system i at one point in
[00:10:07] my life came up with 1000 different
[00:10:09] people um to represent
[00:10:12] each possibility for three digits zero
[00:10:14] zero zero all the way to nine nine nine
[00:10:16] i have a video on this but i basically
[00:10:18] used my original two-digit system which
[00:10:20] i developed at the very beginning it was
[00:10:22] 100 people and when i expanded it to a
[00:10:25] thousand i basically made that extra
[00:10:27] digit it's hard to explain in the short
[00:10:30] video but i use categories right based
[00:10:32] on the original 100 that i had is it
[00:10:34] available in arabic my book it is not
[00:10:36] unfortunately i wish it was it's
[00:10:38] available in japanese chinese
[00:10:42] ukrainian
[00:10:43] russian or whatever that is and uh tai i
[00:10:46] hate to get into an argument with this
[00:10:47] guy and he just starts bringing up every
[00:10:49] single bad thing i've ever done since
[00:10:51] the moment i was born
[00:10:53] yeah funny about that uh that actually
[00:10:56] doesn't happen
[00:10:57] my wife can tell you that um i forget a
[00:10:59] lot of day-to-day stuff she's the one
[00:11:01] that remembers
[00:11:03] stuff like a hawk it's not that bad to
[00:11:05] get an argument with me unless we're
[00:11:07] talking about numbers that i've
[00:11:08] memorized or cards or something yeah i
[00:11:10] forget the day-to-day stuff a lot i was
[00:11:12] in a punk band shows him wearing an
[00:11:14] anime shirt i respect you even greater
[00:11:17] yeah i was in a punk band called
[00:11:19] squandered youth and yeah i remember
[00:11:21] that uh that was the picture you're
[00:11:23] talking about i was wearing a
[00:11:24] hook-up shirt which is a skateboarding
[00:11:26] brand they always have like an anime
[00:11:28] kind of logo on it this is literally the
[00:11:30] first time i have never skipped the
[00:11:31] sponsor ad cool yeah most people do i do
[00:11:34] uh so i appreciate that fun fact the
[00:11:36] color green actually helps you remember
[00:11:38] things more frequently
[00:11:40] did you know that i [ __ ] didn't know
[00:11:41] that that's pretty cool hi nelson how do
[00:11:43] you do in casino good question i don't
[00:11:46] do much with my memory in casinos but i
[00:11:48] do count cards don't tell anybody but i
[00:11:51] actually do i play on a blackjack team
[00:11:53] and we meet occasionally uh to play in
[00:11:55] vegas and other
[00:11:57] casinos around the country and we do
[00:11:59] pretty well that's all i'm gonna say
[00:12:00] about that can remember the placement of
[00:12:02] the cards in the deck forgets what suit
[00:12:04] he's doing yeah i did that in a video
[00:12:06] once
[00:12:06] i was trying to memorize all uh where
[00:12:08] the hearts were and i did the diamonds
[00:12:11] or vice versa i forgot that yeah man i
[00:12:13] don't remember everything memorizing 500
[00:12:15] digits isn't hard but i guess i said
[00:12:17] that somewhere it really isn't if you
[00:12:19] have enough time you could do it i don't
[00:12:21] want to diss a little kid this is the
[00:12:23] little kid three seconds later
[00:12:26] yeah yeah uh yeah sorry alex mullen how
[00:12:29] to memorize chinese characters and
[00:12:30] traditional complex grammar nelson
[00:12:33] animal crossing
[00:12:34] one more reason to love this guy
[00:12:37] both of them are awesome this other
[00:12:38] person replies i agree alex's channel
[00:12:40] was awesome please check him out he's
[00:12:42] way better than i am
[00:12:44] but uh yeah i thought the animal
[00:12:46] crossing one was fun i might do some
[00:12:47] other video games one coming soon in
[00:12:49] relation to that uh you should do some
[00:12:51] games like gta 5 minecraft or anything
[00:12:54] um blah blah blah but yeah
[00:12:57] point here i definitely want to do that
[00:12:59] i don't want to make my channel too
[00:13:00] focused on video games but i love video
[00:13:03] games so i definitely want to do more
[00:13:04] memory palaces or memory palace related
[00:13:07] stuff inside other video games that are
[00:13:09] popular at the moment i love this
[00:13:11] comment this is probably my favorite
[00:13:13] comment i've ever read
[00:13:14] by christopher a i watched this video
[00:13:16] while consuming a pizza and a beer i
[00:13:18] acknowledge and appreciate this video
[00:13:20] i acknowledge and appreciate it indeed
[00:13:23] god i love that i gave it a nice little
[00:13:25] heart i think i replied it's music to my
[00:13:27] ears because if you're watching my video
[00:13:30] you've sat down with a pizza and a beer
[00:13:31] just to watch my video man what an
[00:13:35] absolute honor so thank you christopher
[00:13:38] i imagine you shoot your videos in all
[00:13:39] these different locations just to add to
[00:13:41] your list of memory palaces you can use
[00:13:43] that's true yeah i mean part of the
[00:13:45] reason i love to go to new places and
[00:13:46] shoot them is to actually build a memory
[00:13:49] in that place and often those places i
[00:13:51] will use as a new memory palace yeah for
[00:13:54] sure could you make a video on how you
[00:13:55] practice i would love to be able to have
[00:13:57] a regular practice regimen yeah great
[00:13:59] idea it's on my list of videos that i
[00:14:01] want to make yeah from chris ramsay
[00:14:03] actually had a blast filming this great
[00:14:05] to hang out and hope to do it again soon
[00:14:07] i love chris ramsey you know i had a
[00:14:09] friend back in high school named chris
[00:14:11] ramsay so when he reached out to me on
[00:14:13] instagram this was about uh two years
[00:14:16] ago
[00:14:17] i was like oh that guy from high school
[00:14:18] cool
[00:14:19] good to hear from him and then i saw
[00:14:21] there was a blue check mark by his name
[00:14:22] and i was like wait a minute
[00:14:24] this is this is the puzzle guy maybe
[00:14:28] it was and he was freaking cool about
[00:14:31] everything he loved memory
[00:14:32] we did a collaboration if you haven't
[00:14:34] seen those videos please get to them
[00:14:36] they're so much fun um and i went up to
[00:14:38] his studio in montreal and we had a
[00:14:40] blast love to do it again to be honest
[00:14:42] uh if you'll have me i know he's got a
[00:14:44] new studio
[00:14:46] but uh chris if you're watching let's do
[00:14:48] it again let's do it again do you ever
[00:14:50] think birds and squirrels see stuff like
[00:14:51] this and think who's this guy talking to
[00:14:53] he's nuts uh yeah i like to get in
[00:14:55] little corners of wherever i am and film
[00:14:58] as if i'm like got different camera
[00:15:00] angles and stuff and the one that he's
[00:15:01] talking about is where i'm in the back
[00:15:03] of this kind of forest um talking to the
[00:15:06] trees talking to the floor uh yeah i
[00:15:08] definitely had to be very creative in
[00:15:10] where i was looking for
[00:15:11] places to shoot
[00:15:13] but yeah this is pretty funny but can
[00:15:15] you read a thousand page book in 10
[00:15:17] minutes though
[00:15:18] no more bj shahi references please no
[00:15:20] more nelson which camera are you using
[00:15:23] this is constantly changing um i wish i
[00:15:26] liked to shoot on canons
[00:15:28] for a while i was just shooting with a
[00:15:30] canon 1dx that was ages ago mark ii
[00:15:32] then i got a cinema camera so the 200
[00:15:35] for a while
[00:15:36] and now
[00:15:38] hey nelson what is written on the tattoo
[00:15:40] which is on your wrist i guess it's
[00:15:41] elvish but i'm not sure can you please
[00:15:43] answer my question god i was waiting for
[00:15:45] this yes it is elvish have i ever talked
[00:15:48] about this i don't think so well i got
[00:15:50] this tattoo uh in new zealand on a lord
[00:15:52] of the rings tour how geeky is that i
[00:15:55] don't mind i think it's awesome yeah it
[00:15:56] basically says hell is others
[00:16:01] which is a french quote from one of my
[00:16:02] favorite plays we glow we close
[00:16:06] we close which means no exit um
[00:16:08] translated in english by jean-paul
[00:16:10] sartre or jean-paul sarder if you want
[00:16:12] to say it that way
[00:16:14] [Music]
[00:16:17] it's always just a reminder that no
[00:16:20] matter what people are going to judge
[00:16:21] you that's the hell that you can escape
[00:16:24] about others
[00:16:25] and so with that knowledge just got to
[00:16:27] let go right it's the equivalent to like
[00:16:30] you know a sorority girl getting breathe
[00:16:32] or let it go on the wrist right but in a
[00:16:35] geekier way i guess how coincidental i'm
[00:16:37] just watching the netflix doc and looked
[00:16:38] for your youtube videos and now i see
[00:16:40] you're learning dutch i'm from the
[00:16:41] netherlands cool i i chose this comment
[00:16:44] because
[00:16:45] the netflix film uh it is no longer on
[00:16:48] netflix unfortunately i'm so bummed by
[00:16:50] that because so many people found me
[00:16:52] because of that it was a great way to
[00:16:54] learn about memory sports um it is
[00:16:56] trying to find a new home it might be on
[00:16:58] some kind of other streaming platform
[00:17:01] soon but not netflix unfortunately oh
[00:17:04] i'm so bummed so cool to say i had a
[00:17:06] show on netflix but um it'll be back and
[00:17:08] i will tell you where it is once it is
[00:17:10] back somewhere in the universe hey a
[00:17:12] message from john graham another usa
[00:17:14] memory champion 2018 champion i got
[00:17:17] chills when you talked about one of your
[00:17:19] happiest memories when we reflect on our
[00:17:21] memories it's the emotion that we
[00:17:23] remember the most you're absolutely
[00:17:24] right being present where your feet are
[00:17:26] can help us go deeper into that moment
[00:17:28] great video he's talking about my
[00:17:30] kilimanjaro video and uh yeah man thanks
[00:17:33] for the comment love hearing that from
[00:17:36] other memory enthusiasts as well another
[00:17:39] question how are you getting these
[00:17:40] smooth shots is it drones with a gimbal
[00:17:42] um i do use drones uh for certain shots
[00:17:45] and i do use gimbals for certain shots i
[00:17:48] shoot everything myself more or less so
[00:17:50] doing the gimbal thing
[00:17:52] uh i need someone helping me and i
[00:17:54] rarely have someone doing that yeah this
[00:17:56] is one man's show man i don't i'm not
[00:17:58] big enough of a youtube channel to have
[00:18:00] like a crew filming me or editing for me
[00:18:02] i do everything in-house at least for
[00:18:04] now
[00:18:05] although man i don't know if i could
[00:18:07] trust anybody to do it for me so
[00:18:09] i i stress myself out with all the work
[00:18:11] i do for this channel but uh i i just
[00:18:14] gotta do it myself nice could you do a
[00:18:16] video on how to memorize equations great
[00:18:17] it is in the stack i'm gonna do that
[00:18:19] video i promise this year i promise
[00:18:21] chessboard isn't set up correctly oh i
[00:18:23] got this message so many times and i
[00:18:25] know i [ __ ] up um one of the shots or
[00:18:29] a couple of the shots i had i think the
[00:18:31] queen and the king in the wrong
[00:18:33] place
[00:18:34] i really actually for that whole video
[00:18:36] there were a lot of moving pieces i had
[00:18:37] to cut and reset it a lot of times i was
[00:18:40] trying to be so conscious of where i put
[00:18:41] the pieces because i knew
[00:18:43] i knew
[00:18:45] the trolls out there would find it and
[00:18:47] they did so whoops just curious in
[00:18:49] seeing your take on public speaking
[00:18:51] what's going through your mind when
[00:18:52] you're giving a speech
[00:18:54] when you're given a subject you're
[00:18:55] speaking on so i speak i give memory
[00:18:58] presentations a lot and i speak for big
[00:19:00] crowds for small crowds it depends but
[00:19:03] um you know i feel like the more i think
[00:19:05] about it
[00:19:06] the worse i do
[00:19:08] like yesterday i had a talk and i was
[00:19:11] like maybe i should do something new and
[00:19:12] kind of
[00:19:13] try something i was just like you know
[00:19:14] what no i'm just gonna stick to
[00:19:17] what i know and and honestly like
[00:19:20] i get a bit nervous when i start just a
[00:19:22] little bit and then it goes away but
[00:19:23] during that moment i'm always like what
[00:19:25] am i going to say how am i going to
[00:19:26] start saying it but then i realized like
[00:19:27] if i think too much about that
[00:19:30] i just come out and blurt the wrong
[00:19:31] thing so i actually try to erase
[00:19:33] anything in my mind before i get on
[00:19:34] stage because my personality just comes
[00:19:37] out and i'm passionate about memory
[00:19:39] the subject i'm speaking of and that's
[00:19:41] all that matters it comes across and i
[00:19:42] know what i'm talking about so it ends
[00:19:44] up going totally fine if i do that do
[00:19:46] you think it would work to go to google
[00:19:47] earth and start using street mode to
[00:19:50] walk through a path multiple times and
[00:19:51] use it as memory pals heck yeah what a
[00:19:53] cool idea i never even thought of that
[00:19:55] but definitely if you struggle to have
[00:19:58] memory palaces go to google earth or
[00:20:00] google maps and do the street view thing
[00:20:02] and you have
[00:20:04] the whole world at your disposal right
[00:20:06] learn the abacus it's coming my friends
[00:20:08] i actually have trained a little bit
[00:20:10] with um some sorbonne experts and i plan
[00:20:13] to do a intro to sora bond how to do
[00:20:15] simple calculations on a sorbonne video
[00:20:18] quite soon i don't want you to do a
[00:20:20] blindfold speed run i challenge you to
[00:20:22] do it
[00:20:24] i said challenge accepted
[00:20:26] you wait i have a world record
[00:20:27] attempt coming up anyways
[00:20:30] that's it great questions great comments
[00:20:33] so thank you so much and uh maybe we'll
[00:20:35] do another one of these in a couple more
[00:20:37] years who knows where we'll be then or
[00:20:39] if i'll even be doing youtube stuff yeah
[00:20:41] i think i will be but you never know
[00:20:43] anyways i love you all thank you to the
[00:20:45] new people who have joined and if you're

=== Breaking a Guinness World Record (RECAP) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyjDplkifZc

[00:00:03] [Music]
[00:00:29] [Music]
[00:00:31] what's up memo fam welcome to the new
[00:00:34] year what better way to start off the
[00:00:36] new year by hopefully motivating you a
[00:00:38] little bit by talking about a record
[00:00:41] that i recently broke now will it be
[00:00:42] inspirational i hope so not because of
[00:00:45] the sound bite necessarily that says wow
[00:00:48] nelson does broke a record good for him
[00:00:50] but more for the story behind it and
[00:00:52] actually what happened and unfolded the
[00:00:54] day of the record it's not as
[00:00:57] pretty and perfect as it may seem so
[00:01:00] hopefully you can take some of the
[00:01:01] lessons i learned from that experience
[00:01:03] and maybe apply that to some things
[00:01:05] you're trying to tackle this year in
[00:01:06] 2022
[00:01:08] so let's start with the basics what was
[00:01:10] the plan if you look at my video
[00:01:12] that kind of explained or announced the
[00:01:15] record i was gonna go for it was
[00:01:16] memorizing the most cards underwater in
[00:01:19] a single breath now i spent a couple
[00:01:21] months practicing getting back into the
[00:01:23] groove of my cards luckily i had the
[00:01:25] memory championship
[00:01:27] a little bit before that so i had been
[00:01:28] practicing cards already so i was kind
[00:01:30] of in the groove with that but the big
[00:01:32] thing i had to work on was holding my
[00:01:34] breath
[00:01:34] when i started i could maybe do
[00:01:37] 30 to 40 seconds but after a lot of
[00:01:40] practice i was able to boost that number
[00:01:42] quite a bit we'll get into that so when
[00:01:44] i had this idea to break this record i
[00:01:46] thought about it for years now but it
[00:01:47] wasn't until
[00:01:48] my sponsor my partner mind lab pro who's
[00:01:51] sponsoring this video decided to sponsor
[00:01:54] the entire guinness record attempt why
[00:01:56] not a great way for me to put my mind
[00:01:58] into something knowing that i have some
[00:02:00] support while i added the support i
[00:02:03] needed to do it it also made a lot more
[00:02:05] be at stake and a lot more pressure
[00:02:07] suddenly they were going to be there the
[00:02:09] day of the event they were going to film
[00:02:11] it for me but it was also for the
[00:02:13] product it was for this whole sponsored
[00:02:15] event so there was more at stake than
[00:02:17] just me and my own desire to have a
[00:02:19] guinness record
[00:02:21] i started training a few months in
[00:02:23] advance but i started rigorously
[00:02:24] training about six weeks before the
[00:02:27] event and the event was going to be on
[00:02:29] uh november 13th at the university of
[00:02:31] miami pool on campus so in a place that
[00:02:33] i was somewhat comfortable and it was a
[00:02:36] public space the guinness record
[00:02:38] body requires that it be a public space
[00:02:40] that can be observed by anybody for it
[00:02:42] to be a valid record so at first i
[00:02:44] started practicing in my parents pool we
[00:02:46] live in miami i don't have a pool but my
[00:02:48] parents do so every couple times a week
[00:02:51] i'd go over to the house and pretty much
[00:02:53] just work on holding my breath i started
[00:02:55] using an app that also helped me
[00:02:57] practice
[00:02:58] getting better at holding my breath and
[00:03:00] my co2 tolerance in this case the breath
[00:03:03] holds get longer
[00:03:05] and the amount of time i breathe is the
[00:03:07] same one minute
[00:03:09] breathing one minute 20 of hold
[00:03:12] one minute breathing one minute 25 of
[00:03:14] holding
[00:03:15] and so on and so on there's 10 rounds it
[00:03:17] gets up to two minute holds and i would
[00:03:20] do that sometimes in the water sometimes
[00:03:22] on land just in my office before bed
[00:03:24] whatever whenever i had a moment and it
[00:03:26] usually involved two kind of exercises
[00:03:28] one where i would hold my breath longer
[00:03:29] and longer while breathing in between
[00:03:32] for a fixed amount of time or kind of
[00:03:34] the other way around where i would hold
[00:03:35] my breath for a certain amount of time
[00:03:36] fix but then the amount of time to
[00:03:38] breathe the air before the next breath
[00:03:41] hold would get shorter and shorter and
[00:03:43] this is kind of what free divers do this
[00:03:45] is what surfers do to train their
[00:03:47] capacity to hold their breath longer in
[00:03:49] the end i was able to get my personal
[00:03:51] best of holding my breath and that was
[00:03:53] three minutes and 45 seconds
[00:03:56] i wanted to get to that four minute mark
[00:03:58] but three minutes 45 seconds i
[00:04:01] really can't believe that i'm under
[00:04:02] water for nearly four minutes without a
[00:04:05] breath that was pretty cool and what was
[00:04:06] always interesting to me because i had
[00:04:07] never noticed this but after a while of
[00:04:09] being underwater
[00:04:11] your body naturally starts to convulse
[00:04:13] it
[00:04:14] it's trying to make you breathe because
[00:04:16] of the co2 buildup
[00:04:18] and part of the training is to kind of
[00:04:20] suppress or be able to tolerate that
[00:04:22] feeling and to push it back to be able
[00:04:24] to fight through the pain and i remember
[00:04:26] when i first started that feeling kicked
[00:04:28] in in maybe 20 30 seconds and then i'd
[00:04:30] give up maybe 10 seconds after that but
[00:04:33] i realized after training i'd hit maybe
[00:04:35] a minute before that happened and then
[00:04:38] eventually a minute 15 before that
[00:04:40] happened and then by the end i was
[00:04:42] getting to about a minute and a half
[00:04:44] with no convulsions before my co2 desire
[00:04:47] started to make me feel really
[00:04:49] uncomfortable a minute and a half that's
[00:04:51] pretty awesome but that's pretty cool
[00:04:53] because that means that another minute
[00:04:54] and a half
[00:04:55] plus was me just fighting this urge of
[00:04:58] my body convulsing now that's cool but
[00:05:00] it's also
[00:05:02] tricky because now that's
[00:05:03] distracting for when i memorize right
[00:05:05] imagine convulsing while trying to make
[00:05:08] sure that you have cards in your mind
[00:05:09] right so i started doing that training
[00:05:11] and then i started you know
[00:05:13] incorporating the cards underwater i
[00:05:15] bought a whole set of underwater cards
[00:05:17] and i basically
[00:05:19] would do mostly the onland uh co2
[00:05:22] training the oxygen breath holding
[00:05:24] training with the app and then i would
[00:05:26] do some training of memorizing
[00:05:28] you know half a deck underwater
[00:05:30] easy then i would do three quarters of a
[00:05:32] deck underwater okay i could do that
[00:05:34] then i did a whole deck underwater and i
[00:05:37] got to a point where i could do that one
[00:05:39] deck pretty consistently casually
[00:05:42] without much problem you know whether i
[00:05:44] stayed underwater a minute whether i
[00:05:46] said it underwater a full two minutes to
[00:05:47] be certain i had all the cards
[00:05:49] i was good with one deck so i started
[00:05:51] focusing more on the breath holding
[00:05:53] because if i could get more comfortable
[00:05:55] underwater i knew that the cards would
[00:05:57] follow by the end of that week i was
[00:06:00] hitting the record and even breaking the
[00:06:02] record i think my highest i ever got was
[00:06:04] like 79 maybe i touched 82 i'd have to
[00:06:07] check but i felt good and now what i
[00:06:09] started to kind of formulate what the
[00:06:11] plan was going to be on the day of
[00:06:12] because if i showed up and i did a
[00:06:14] record attempt and i failed that's going
[00:06:16] to look pretty bad i didn't want to
[00:06:18] disappoint my sponsor so i decided i was
[00:06:20] going to go for two records there was
[00:06:21] another record which might serve better
[00:06:24] as a warm-up and if i got it at least
[00:06:27] i'd get my main goal of getting a
[00:06:28] guinness world record that was always a
[00:06:30] goal one thing that i don't have in my
[00:06:32] memory accolades is a guinness record so
[00:06:35] if i could get one and that's it no
[00:06:36] matter what it was related to memory of
[00:06:38] course
[00:06:39] cool goal complete for 2021. so the
[00:06:42] other record was memorize a single deck
[00:06:44] of cards underwater however long it
[00:06:46] takes just one deck and the record is
[00:06:47] how fast you can reconstruct the deck
[00:06:50] basically the recall that was going to
[00:06:51] be what i would do first hopefully i'd
[00:06:53] get that record out of the way and then
[00:06:54] i could spend all the time i wanted on
[00:06:56] the the most cards memorized underwater
[00:06:59] record and if i fail that if i had to do
[00:07:01] a bunch of times no big deal so then the
[00:07:03] week of the event came up and i decided
[00:07:05] that i would practice entirely at the
[00:07:08] place where it was going to happen at
[00:07:09] the um pool i'm always like that like
[00:07:11] when there's a competition coming or
[00:07:13] some kind of big thing that i need to
[00:07:15] perform at i like to have some practice
[00:07:17] at the place because then when i show up
[00:07:19] for the actual event i already have that
[00:07:21] experience of being there and knowing my
[00:07:24] surroundings and all that stuff usually
[00:07:26] really helps me and by the thursday and
[00:07:28] friday essentially the day or days
[00:07:31] before i felt really good i had beaten
[00:07:32] the record numerous times in my practice
[00:07:35] sessions i felt really good and i had
[00:07:37] this whole game plan in mind that i was
[00:07:38] gonna do the first record as a warm up
[00:07:41] and then i was gonna go for broke on the
[00:07:42] second record hopefully get it
[00:07:44] immediately if i had to do it a few
[00:07:46] times i'd accounted for that i got a
[00:07:48] certain amount of decks of cards prepped
[00:07:50] i got all my witnesses and assistant
[00:07:53] people to help me shuffle the cards time
[00:07:55] things blah blah blah as per the
[00:07:58] guinness record rules and i was good to
[00:08:00] go mind lab pro showed up the day before
[00:08:03] to do some kind of behind the scenes
[00:08:04] filming and then the morning of we did a
[00:08:07] little more filming and then it was go
[00:08:09] time
[00:08:11] so the day of the record attempt felt
[00:08:14] really good i did a few breath holds i
[00:08:16] was really on my game getting three and
[00:08:18] a half minutes to 3 45 minutes uh breath
[00:08:22] holding i was doing a couple decks not
[00:08:23] too many before
[00:08:25] i'm about to memorize cards i don't like
[00:08:26] to do too many sets of memorizing it's
[00:08:29] just to keep it fresh my memory palace
[00:08:30] is fresh and then
[00:08:32] the event happened weather was great was
[00:08:34] warm and then a group started gathering
[00:08:36] there were some news outlets there it
[00:08:38] was becoming the real deal i was getting
[00:08:40] a bit nervous but again i knew that that
[00:08:41] first record i was gonna go for that
[00:08:43] warm-up was something i could do fairly
[00:08:45] casually so it started started recording
[00:08:48] video sponsor was recording video my
[00:08:50] witnesses were there everything was in
[00:08:52] place i got in the water the decks were
[00:08:54] shuffled and handed to me and i
[00:08:55] attempted the first
[00:08:57] record and this is how it went actually
[00:08:59] just kidding i mean if i were to show
[00:09:01] you this this is actually the most
[00:09:02] uninteresting part me breaking the
[00:09:03] record because nothing goes wrong i do
[00:09:05] exactly what i said i was going to do so
[00:09:07] let's kind of zip through this if you
[00:09:09] really want to watch it detail for
[00:09:10] detail i'll put the link of the entire
[00:09:12] video unsped up uncut whatever in the
[00:09:15] description so in short i had a
[00:09:16] professional come and shuffle the cards
[00:09:19] the cards are then handed to a witness i
[00:09:20] had two of them to help handle the cards
[00:09:22] in and out of the pool i get in the pool
[00:09:24] i spend about two minutes kind of
[00:09:26] pre-breathing making sure i fill up my
[00:09:28] lungs with air i get some good exhale
[00:09:30] get the co2 out of my system bloody blah
[00:09:33] blah go underwater i do the thing
[00:09:36] memorize the cards
[00:09:37] riveting stuff i know and then i shoot
[00:09:40] back up hand the cards to another
[00:09:41] witness i spend a moment here just kind
[00:09:43] of consolidating everything in my mind
[00:09:44] making sure i know the order of the deck
[00:09:47] which i do the other witness opens a
[00:09:48] fresh pack of cards and then i speedily
[00:09:51] put it in the order of the one that i
[00:09:52] memorized it's then verified one by one
[00:09:56] to see that they match voila guinness
[00:09:58] record in the books i got it i destroyed
[00:10:02] the record you could say by a whole
[00:10:04] minute and then it was time to do the
[00:10:05] other record the most cards the one i
[00:10:07] really cared about to be honest because
[00:10:09] i don't know something about memorizing
[00:10:10] the most of anything always sounds kind
[00:10:12] of beefy in my mind
[00:10:14] but alas it would not be so i went back
[00:10:17] into the water getting ready to memorize
[00:10:19] the most cards ever underwater i was
[00:10:22] first going to try something very
[00:10:23] conservative just to beat the record
[00:10:25] which was 67 maybe get 72 or something
[00:10:27] like that and then if i did that on the
[00:10:29] first try i would do another attempt and
[00:10:32] really go for broke i knew that the
[00:10:33] pressure was on this is the record that
[00:10:35] i really wanted
[00:10:36] and i flubbed it i think i need to try
[00:10:39] that again it wasn't my best and i
[00:10:41] actually had to give this record a few
[00:10:43] more tries was getting late the pool was
[00:10:46] gonna close the sun was setting it was
[00:10:47] getting darker so i actually gave this
[00:10:49] record five solid attempts and still
[00:10:52] couldn't get it damn i will say that my
[00:10:54] last attempt the fifth one was my
[00:10:56] closest i got i think about 72 73 cards
[00:11:00] by swapping the place of two cards i
[00:11:02] could say all i want i didn't get the
[00:11:04] record so it really doesn't matter close
[00:11:06] but no cigar such is the story of my
[00:11:07] life right i get really close to
[00:11:09] something and i don't quite make it
[00:11:11] but that's okay you know that's that's
[00:11:13] kind of there's a lesson to learn there
[00:11:15] i got my guinness record i'm happy with
[00:11:16] that but it allows me to work towards
[00:11:19] something in my life i don't think
[00:11:20] anything's ever been given to me really
[00:11:22] easily i've always had to work at it
[00:11:24] even when i won the memory championship
[00:11:26] you know i was
[00:11:27] gonna win in 2010 but i made a mistake
[00:11:30] in the finals my own fault and i had to
[00:11:32] wait a whole other year
[00:11:34] man i remember that feeling just saying
[00:11:36] i have to wait a year to really win this
[00:11:38] i know i can win it and it was honestly
[00:11:40] the best lesson i ever had i came back
[00:11:43] and won it and it felt even better and
[00:11:45] then i won it again and again and again
[00:11:46] and again so
[00:11:48] same goes for everest you know i keep
[00:11:49] failing i don't want to call it failing
[00:11:51] i keep coming short on the summit but i
[00:11:54] know i'll get it one day and when i do
[00:11:56] get it it'll feel
[00:11:58] really good even more so because i
[00:12:00] persisted and kept at it so same with
[00:12:02] this record i'm gonna attempt it next
[00:12:03] year and not only am i gonna just break
[00:12:06] it i'm gonna smash this record you'll
[00:12:07] see so for this year 2022 hopefully that
[00:12:10] story's a little interesting a little
[00:12:12] insight into you know how i go about
[00:12:14] things i know from the surface it seems
[00:12:16] like wow he breaks records he wins
[00:12:18] championships cool but i fail a lot i
[00:12:22] really fail a lot i mean the negative
[00:12:24] down moments are often
[00:12:26] really the points that
[00:12:28] define you i've talked about this in
[00:12:30] many of my
[00:12:32] memory memory championship loss videos
[00:12:34] is that losing is often better than
[00:12:37] winning because it really transforms you
[00:12:39] and
[00:12:40] you know makes you into a better person
[00:12:42] or it kind of navigates you towards
[00:12:44] better things
[00:12:46] so
[00:12:47] 2022 think of all the bad things and
[00:12:50] kind of negative
[00:12:51] things that have happened to you in the
[00:12:52] last year or so and
[00:12:54] just tell yourself that that is going to
[00:12:56] guide you into this year and even if
[00:12:58] stuff happens this year that isn't what
[00:13:00] you want or it's just weighing you down
[00:13:02] or bad situations are happening to you
[00:13:04] or you're not quite getting to your
[00:13:06] goals or you tried everything and you
[00:13:07] still didn't get your goals
[00:13:09] it's all part of
[00:13:11] that journey and it's gonna pay off in
[00:13:13] the end if you persist persist anyways
[00:13:16] thanks for watching and again a big
[00:13:18] thank you to mylab pro for being with me
[00:13:21] throughout this whole endeavor i
[00:13:23] couldn't have done it without them and

=== Let's speedrun DUOLINGO in ITALIAN ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzt19IFVUww

[00:00:00] all right let's do this today we are
[00:00:02] going to do something that i've seen all
[00:00:03] over the internet and i figured
[00:00:05] something i need to probably try and
[00:00:06] that is to speed run duolingo
[00:00:10] yeah we're going to choose a language
[00:00:12] and speed run the heck out of it because
[00:00:14] why not can i get through the first
[00:00:17] checkpoint of a chosen language on
[00:00:19] duolingo as fast as possible i think so
[00:00:22] so let's go let's put a timer on the
[00:00:24] clock
[00:00:27] thank you and let's go well first i
[00:00:29] guess we gotta choose a language and uh
[00:00:32] let's not go too crazy i speak french i
[00:00:35] speak english i speak more or less basic
[00:00:38] spanish and i speak decent dutch now so
[00:00:41] this is very introductory i've never
[00:00:43] really played around with duolingo i've
[00:00:44] done a little bit years ago let's dive
[00:00:47] in with something that should be okay to
[00:00:49] speed run it's not going to fry my brain
[00:00:51] and the language i've always wanted to
[00:00:53] know and learn is italian
[00:00:56] maybe in the future i'll do something
[00:00:57] that's totally different from any
[00:00:58] language that i already know like
[00:01:00] chinese or russian or arabic or
[00:01:02] something like that now do i know any
[00:01:04] italian i know the basics the foods the
[00:01:06] pastas the pizzas i can kind of
[00:01:09] understand when someone speaks italian
[00:01:12] very slowly of course
[00:01:14] unusually written a lot of things are
[00:01:16] shared with french and spanish i feel
[00:01:18] like knowing those two language really
[00:01:19] helps so let's see how that goes
[00:01:21] [Music]
[00:01:25] i guess we're diving into this i know
[00:01:27] the basic the girl
[00:01:31] how do you say girl
[00:01:34] how do i know that i just know it okay
[00:01:37] um translate the senate the only thing i
[00:01:39] do remember when i did a summer abroad
[00:01:41] in italy is really switzerland italy is
[00:01:44] eosono nelson
[00:01:46] i am nelson so yo sono gaza
[00:01:50] okay that means i am
[00:01:53] a girl
[00:01:56] i am
[00:01:59] the man i am the man i am the man a
[00:02:03] woman dona boy regatta girl regatta
[00:02:12] [Music]
[00:02:16] that seems good right how can i see the
[00:02:18] whole structure here my my goal is to
[00:02:19] get to the first checkpoint now i know
[00:02:21] you can take a placement test to skip
[00:02:23] the whole dang thing but i'm not that
[00:02:25] good all right cool so we've got the
[00:02:26] basics let's keep going because we've
[00:02:28] got a clock here going on i i guess i
[00:02:30] have to do the basics three times
[00:02:33] okay let's go which is the apple i don't
[00:02:36] know maybe the one with the drawing of
[00:02:37] the apple lamella
[00:02:40] apple smells like an apple
[00:02:43] why am i talking like this
[00:02:47] the boy
[00:02:50] eats the apple now is this stuff like
[00:02:53] actually teaching i mean i guess i am
[00:02:55] learning how to say boy girl woman man
[00:02:58] apple eats
[00:03:00] but damn i don't know
[00:03:02] all right so you know what i was
[00:03:03] thinking instead of going through all of
[00:03:05] these different lessons here i got to do
[00:03:07] multiple times it's going to take quite
[00:03:09] a while i think you know the ultimate
[00:03:10] goal is to get to the checkpoint why
[00:03:12] don't i just jump to the checkpoint
[00:03:13] because you can test out here like if
[00:03:15] you know enough italian
[00:03:16] you can pass through this and continue
[00:03:19] without having to do all this stuff so i
[00:03:20] think with my knowledge of french and
[00:03:22] spanish and the
[00:03:23] hackability of this game because it is a
[00:03:25] game after all and there is
[00:03:27] some kind of formulaic
[00:03:29] like
[00:03:30] logistical stuff that you can figure it
[00:03:32] out let's see if we can get through this
[00:03:33] i mean how impressive
[00:03:35] sad would it be if someone with no
[00:03:37] italian experience could just jump
[00:03:39] through the checkpoint right i mean what
[00:03:41] does that say about a language learning
[00:03:43] platform right
[00:03:44] all right let's start the timer
[00:03:47] right now
[00:03:49] all right make less than four mistakes
[00:03:51] to pass a challenge so i have four
[00:03:52] mistakes i can make
[00:03:54] how do we say juice
[00:03:55] could be stick a steak probably
[00:03:58] tay probably tastes succo i guess
[00:04:01] yeah okay so cool juice is succo you
[00:04:04] suck at the juice
[00:04:06] of the juice
[00:04:09] the
[00:04:11] girl
[00:04:12] drinks
[00:04:14] a tea

[00:06:44] got to say so
[00:06:46] plural think it's lay i guess because
[00:06:49] lies
[00:06:50] yes okay
[00:06:52] um they do not eat meat
[00:06:54] loro
[00:06:57] because it was capitalized so i guess
[00:06:58] they is loro
[00:07:00] i can remember that like lord of the
[00:07:02] rings laurel of the rings multiple
[00:07:04] people the fellowship they
[00:07:06] um do not eat okay the ordering here is
[00:07:09] going to be funky
[00:07:12] uh so meet this carne
[00:07:14] got me
[00:07:16] [Music]
[00:07:27] nice
[00:07:28] cool
[00:07:29] oh shoot we have to write stuff
[00:07:32] uh fish
[00:07:39] yes
[00:07:41] okay we drink lemonade uh noi
[00:07:46] now a lot of these i'm going straight to
[00:07:48] the first word only because it's
[00:07:49] capitalized i just see that it's gotta
[00:07:51] be the first word right so that's
[00:07:52] actually helping me here drink um
[00:07:57] plural is probably better
[00:08:02] all right we're almost
[00:08:04] the bee
[00:08:10] oh
[00:08:12] i know a baill or something
[00:08:17] french is not bae
[00:08:20] but that's probably not it
[00:08:24] bae
[00:08:37] una chintura
[00:08:50] hell yeah a belt
[00:08:52] the
[00:08:55] uh ill
[00:08:58] i think
[00:09:00] it's like cuoco or something
[00:09:02] yeah okay because i just i just knew
[00:09:05] that because i'm angie
[00:09:18] [Music]
[00:09:20] is it just mangy
[00:09:22] yeah okay man okay weird what do you eat
[00:09:26] the wine
[00:09:34] vino right
[00:09:38] yeah see many restaurants with that word
[00:09:47] for falling
[00:09:57] butterfly i just know that
[00:10:00] your butterflies
[00:10:01] a very common
[00:10:03] phrase to be tested on your butterflies
[00:10:05] not mine
[00:10:07] got so many things i gotta write here i
[00:10:09] don't even know how to write this
[00:10:12] costume
[00:10:22] wait did i do it
[00:10:26] oh yeah did i get one wrong oh yeah the
[00:10:28] the b right
[00:10:31] all right so
[00:10:35] my thoughts i'm a bit biased in the past
[00:10:37] i've used other apps to learn languages
[00:10:40] specifically drops right i use that to
[00:10:42] learn dutch in a year
[00:10:44] and although i don't necessarily agree
[00:10:47] that
[00:10:48] just blindly memorizing
[00:10:50] uh just vocabulary is the way to go to
[00:10:53] become fluent in the language or to
[00:10:54] learn language because you still got to
[00:10:56] learn the grammar right which is what
[00:10:58] this app does or at least tries to get
[00:11:01] you to do
[00:11:02] i think that with both obviously they're
[00:11:04] very good at getting you to play the
[00:11:06] game and i think before anything that's
[00:11:08] probably the best thing you can do
[00:11:10] because a lot of people they just get
[00:11:12] stuck and they say hey i want to learn
[00:11:15] you know french or i want to learn
[00:11:16] russian and then they just buy all the
[00:11:18] books and then it just sits there and
[00:11:19] then you just never start because it's
[00:11:21] hard the friction of of entry is always
[00:11:25] difficult and it's it can be like can
[00:11:27] beat you down right with this game
[00:11:30] clearly
[00:11:31] makes me feel like i know italian when i
[00:11:33] clearly don't the thing i i don't like
[00:11:35] about this is it gives you a false sense
[00:11:37] of
[00:11:38] accomplishment like i just beat that
[00:11:40] checkpoint i know
[00:11:43] like
[00:11:43] enough to be at the level of checkpoint
[00:11:46] one i don't know how many checkpoints
[00:11:47] there are but you know i feel like
[00:11:50] super confident and i guess that's a
[00:11:51] good thing because it'll get me to keep
[00:11:52] playing but if i were to go to italy
[00:11:54] right now with that sense of confidence
[00:11:56] i would be
[00:11:57] hit on and with drops there's no sense
[00:12:00] of that yes you know words and that is a
[00:12:02] confidence booster but at least you're
[00:12:04] kind of
[00:12:05] grounded in a realm of understanding
[00:12:07] that uh of reality that you just know
[00:12:10] words right you don't know any grammar
[00:12:12] and i would say that that
[00:12:15] would actually encourage you to go out
[00:12:16] and say you know what i know some words
[00:12:18] let me know and properly learn grammar
[00:12:20] however you want to do that i think this
[00:12:21] alone
[00:12:22] you can't
[00:12:24] in short i think the gamification while
[00:12:27] great uh is misleading in this app and
[00:12:30] i'm not a fan
[00:12:32] it's addictive i like how it kind of
[00:12:34] draws you in the colors the the sounds
[00:12:36] the reinforcement it is very inviting
[00:12:39] but again i don't like that false sense
[00:12:41] of accomplishment it's deceiving what do
[00:12:43] i know i mean do i really know how to
[00:12:45] put together sentences
[00:12:47] no i dragged a few words here and there
[00:12:49] and yeah i had to spell some things that
[00:12:50] i heard but a lot of it was just
[00:12:52] guessing and uh you know i was able to
[00:12:54] make some mistakes and still carry on so
[00:12:57] so yeah just a quick little video of me
[00:13:00] trying something a little different i
[00:13:02] love learning new languages and italian
[00:13:04] is definitely on my list maybe i'll
[00:13:06] circle back to that uh in a little while
[00:13:09] but so for this coming year 2022 i have
[00:13:12] a project that i'll be working on i'll
[00:13:14] be announcing it soon
[00:13:16] bear with me but it has to do with
[00:13:17] language learning and i'm really excited
[00:13:19] about it and i will be working with the
[00:13:20] drops app to kind of help realize that
[00:13:23] again and the beginning of the year it's
[00:13:24] a perfect time to start working on the
[00:13:26] new you so i would highly recommend
[00:13:28] downloading the app drops it's free to
[00:13:30] try they got this freemium model you can
[00:13:32] pay a subscription to get rid of ads to
[00:13:34] be able to play it more or whatever it's
[00:13:35] super worth it they have so many
[00:13:37] languages and you know it's just again
[00:13:39] it's not what you're going to use to to
[00:13:40] kind of get fluent but it is a way to
[00:13:43] kind of get started on your goal of
[00:13:45] learning language and i think it's more
[00:13:46] effective than duolingo in my personal
[00:13:48] opinion in my humble opinion that
[00:13:51] matters at all to any of you now i'll be
[00:13:53] giving away one
[00:13:55] free year membership to drops to someone
[00:13:58] who comments in the description below
[00:14:00] just let me know what's your story why
[00:14:02] do you want this uh what are you trying
[00:14:04] to learn right what would you do with
[00:14:05] this free membership for a year
[00:14:07] whichever story i like the best i'll let
[00:14:09] you know that you're the winner and i'll
[00:14:11] share a code to download and get the
[00:14:13] whole drops app for free for a year deal
[00:14:16] sounds good all right cool anyways
[00:14:18] thanks for watching guys happy start of
[00:14:20] the new year and i'll see you in the
[00:14:22] next video ciao
[00:14:26] [Music]
[00:14:34] you


=== I memorized the entire Periodic Table. Here's how. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UMzQ5yQDko

[00:00:00] This video is sponsored
by Mindlab Pro
[00:00:02] Stick around to the end of
the video to hear more about them.
[00:00:21] So recently I won my fifth
USA Memory Championship.
[00:00:25] Part of the preparation
for that-
[00:00:27] They have added this recent new event
called Long Term Memory.
[00:00:31] Which is...
Memorizing something long term.
[00:00:35] And then, in the competition,
we are tested on it.
[00:00:37] About a month out
from the competition,
[00:00:39] they'll tell us what we
have to pre-memorize
[00:00:41] and it's a lot of information.
We just need to master it.
[00:00:44] We don't know exactly
what they are gonna ask, but-
[00:00:46] it's required to advance to the finals
of this competition.
[00:00:49] So, we found out
[00:00:51] about a month before
the championship that
[00:00:54] we are gonna have to
memorize a few things
[00:00:56] and one of the things that
was the most exciting to me was
[00:00:59] the entire Periodic Table.
[00:01:01] So in this video I
am gonna show you
[00:01:03] how I approached
and how I ended up
[00:01:05] successfully memorizing
the entire thing
[00:01:08] in just a few days.
[00:01:10] This won't be an exact tutorial
[00:01:11] of how to memorize
every single piece of data
[00:01:13] but hopefully this will give you
some ideas in how to memorize
[00:01:16] some large amount
of information
[00:01:18] and to get it into your
long term memory fast.
[00:01:21] Now, as you may know,
[00:01:22] I am in an office here.
This is actually my University office.
[00:01:25] I am a teacher, instructor,
lecturer- whatever you wanna call it-
[00:01:29] at the University of Miami
and I am on-campus
[00:01:31] and we are here because
I actually used
[00:01:34] part of the campus to
memorize the Periodic Table.
[00:01:37] Let's get out of this office
[00:01:38] and go out in the field
and I will show you
[00:01:40] where and what memory palace
I used
[00:01:44] and how I used it to store
[00:01:46] the entire periodic table.
[00:01:49] Let's go.
[00:02:00] Alright.
[00:02:00] So first thing we gotta do
is figure out what are we memorising.
[00:02:03] Because, what I am gonna
do in this video is give you five steps-
[00:02:06] five tips really on how to
memorize something big for the long term.
[00:02:09] So the first thing, you know,
what are we memorising here?
[00:02:12] It's the elements.
[00:02:13] What are the elements?
[00:02:13] What is the general overview
of what these elements are?
[00:02:17] This data, what is it?
[00:02:18] So obviously this is the periodic table
with a 118 different symbols
[00:02:23] with some numbers..
What do they mean? Bla-bla-bla.
[00:02:26] And then the next question is
how do I need to retrieve this information?
[00:02:29] Well, in the competition,
they could ask me anything.
[00:02:31] They could ask me,
"What's the symbol for this element?"
[00:02:34] What's the atomic number
for this one?
[00:02:37] So this leads me to the first tip
[00:02:38] which is - Know your data
and be smart.
[00:02:40] So looking at your data,
see what you need to learn,
[00:02:43] first of all.
[00:02:43] What you don't.
[00:02:44] Or what's kind of
gonna be easier to learn
[00:02:46] maybe without even
using any techniques.
[00:02:48] And then just look at the data
in general and
[00:02:51] see are there any shortcuts here.
[00:02:52] So I know a lot of people
who just say,
[00:02:54] "Oh, I am gonna use a memory palace
for this, for that."
[00:02:56] But you don't need to
all the time.
[00:02:57] So I look at this list for example,
I know a lot of these...
[00:03:00] Okay, but... I do wanna know
all of them in order.
[00:03:03] I wanna know all their atomic numbers
and masses
[00:03:05] and all that stuff
and be able to go
[00:03:07] from the name to the number,
from the number to the name.
[00:03:10] But the state, whether
it's a gas solid or a liquid
[00:03:13] or the symbol-
I don't think I need to include that.
[00:03:16] Right, the symbols I know mostly
and a lot of them are very intuitive
[00:03:20] and there's maybe a handful
that are kinda tricky and I can just learn
[00:03:23] separately out.
[00:03:24] In terms of the actual states,
you know, solid, liquid or gas,
[00:03:27] it looks like all of them
are solid
[00:03:29] except for two liquids
and there's 11 gases.
[00:03:33] I can just learn those.
[00:03:34] Just by repetition. It's not a lot.
It's easy.
[00:03:37] I could do that separate.
[00:03:38] So all I need to worry about
are the name, the atomic number
[00:03:41] the atomic mass, the boiling point
[00:03:43] and then... I look at the date of
discovery and the discoverer.
[00:03:47] That looks little complicated
so I might save that for later.
[00:03:50] But I need to know those things.
[00:03:52] The rest- I'll deal with.
[00:03:56] Alright. Step number two-
[00:03:57] and this is what I did-
[00:03:58] is to basically lay
the groundwork,
[00:04:01] in the simplest way.
[00:04:03] So there's a lot of data here.
[00:04:04] I'm looking at this 
and I say, what is the simplest
[00:04:08] kind of organizational, foundational
thing I could memorize.
[00:04:12] And that to me is obviously
the atomic number
[00:04:15] which is just 1 through 118.
[00:04:17] It's in order.
It's a list.
[00:04:19] And the name of the element 
that goes with each number.
[00:04:22] Easy.
[00:04:22] So I just imagine that that's 
the only thing I have to memorize
[00:04:25] and the other stuff - 
I'll deal with later.
[00:04:27] I'm not gonna go through
all 118 now
[00:04:30] but let me just go through
the first 10 elements
[00:04:33] that I memorized.
[00:04:34] 1 to 10.
[00:04:35] Here I am on the University
of Miami campus.
[00:04:37] The first thing I had to decide was
where my memory palace was gonna be.
[00:04:41] What was location number one
gonna be
[00:04:42] and what was location number 10
going to be.
[00:04:44] What was gonna be in between?
[00:04:46] Though I did that
beforehand in my mind,
[00:04:47] you can even do it on paper.
Just decide -
[00:04:50] what was one through ten?
[00:04:51] Or in my case what was 
one through 118.
[00:04:53] And then, for each of those
ten things,
[00:04:56] I basically came up
with an image
[00:04:57] for the element.
[00:04:59] Some of them are really obvious.
[00:05:00] Some of them - I have to think
a little bit or be very creative.
[00:05:03] But ultimately it's the same process
as anything.
[00:05:05] Come up with an image for 
the weird word that an element is
[00:05:08] and then put it in a position
in your memory palace
[00:05:12] that tells you the location.
[00:05:13] Now I need to make sure that I know 
those 10 locations really well
[00:05:16] so I can recall element 5
[00:05:19] element 7, element 3,
element 1
[00:05:22] Just like that.
[00:05:23] Let's take a look at those
ten locations
[00:05:25] and what images I would place
at each one.
[00:05:28] Let's go.
[00:05:30] Alright, so we are just 
coming down
[00:05:32] from the Chemistry Department here
[00:05:34] and our pathway
[00:05:35] is gonna be down there
to the Physics Department.
[00:05:38] Okay.
[00:05:39] How fitting, right?
[00:05:40] We are doing the elements
using the chemistry and physics department.
[00:05:42] Love it.
[00:05:43] Alright, so our first location
are gonna be these steps here.
[00:05:46] And...
[00:05:47] that's easy to remember
[00:05:48] It's the entry way kind of down
to the Physics Department here.
[00:05:51] Number one, which is Hydrogen.
[00:05:54] So what's my image for Hydrogen?
[00:05:55] Just water.
[00:05:56] And I am gonna
imagine water just kind of
[00:05:58] flooding, cascading
down the steps here.
[00:06:00] Super easy to remember
[00:06:02] we're done.
[00:06:02] Second, we're gonna come over
to this door
[00:06:04] This leads to the electrical
engineering department.
[00:06:06] Our next element 
is gonna be Helium.
[00:06:09] So I'm gonna picture
just a bunch of balloons
[00:06:12] attached to that door.
[00:06:13] Next we have this bike rack
right here.
[00:06:15] Our third element is gonna 
be Lithium.
[00:06:17] So I am gonna imagine that instead of 
bikes attached to these bike-mounts
[00:06:21] it's just a bunch of Lithium batteries.
[00:06:22] Alright?
[00:06:23] Across the way right here,
[00:06:25] this little solar panel thing-
whatever that is...
[00:06:27] I have no idea what it is.
[00:06:28] We have Beryllium
[00:06:29] which reminds me of a bear.
[00:06:31] Bear-llium
[00:06:32] So I just imagine a bear
[00:06:34] kind of..
[00:06:34] cranking that 
with an Allen wrench
[00:06:36] or just kind of sunbathing there
[00:06:37] or just chained to that thing.
[00:06:39] Alright, let's keep walking.
[00:06:40] Our next element is Boron.
[00:06:42] And I'm gonna use 
this little post here.
[00:06:44] I don't know what it does but 
I guess it blocks carts from coming here.
[00:06:47] And I am just gonna picture-
Just kind of
[00:06:49] maybe bore- boring like,
the action of boring a hole
[00:06:53] Imagine this is boring a hole
into the ground right there.
[00:06:56] And now, this is my fifth location
[00:06:58] right?
[00:06:58] 1-2-3-4 and 5.
[00:07:01] So I might make a little mental note
that 5
[00:07:04] is here.
[00:07:04] So I can quickly jump
to this if I want.
[00:07:07] Every five I like to jump or 
have an image so I can jump there.
[00:07:10] So 5.. I'll think like
5 boring machines.
[00:07:14] Boring a tunnel.
[00:07:15] That's number 6, alright.
And that's gonna be Carbon.
[00:07:18] It's a parking lot, so you put
your car there.
[00:07:20] Let's keep going.
[00:07:21] Number 7 is Nitrogen.
[00:07:24] I'm just gonna think of like...
A nitrobooster
[00:07:26] on the back of a car
just kind of like
[00:07:28] shooting flames of the back 
of a car.
[00:07:31] Okay, I'm just gonna
think of a nitrobooster.
[00:07:33] Then we are gonna use this
open space here- The next one
[00:07:35] number 8- For Oxygen,
I'm gonna picture
[00:07:38] just some barrels of Oxygen.
[00:07:39] Or Oxygen tanks.
[00:07:41] Kind of like we use 
on Everest.
[00:07:42] So they are just kind of
stacked up here.
[00:07:44] Tons of them.
[00:07:45] That's it.
[00:07:45] 9 will be up these little stairs here
[00:07:47] if you group there, it leads to
all the Physics classrooms.
[00:07:50] For here, I am gonna picture
just a bunch of flowers
[00:07:52] which helps me remember Fluorine.
[00:07:53] Flower-Fluorine- close enough.
[00:07:55] Now, if you go up the steps here,
[00:07:57] into a little tower here,
[00:08:01] in the stairwell
[00:08:03] our 10th element is Neon.
[00:08:05] So I'm just gonna picture walking in here.
[00:08:07] and just a bunch of crazy 
party-neon-lights.
[00:08:10] It's stumpin' in here man.
[00:08:12] And because it was the number 10
[00:08:13] I'm gonna just remember you know
[00:08:15] Neon lights, clubs, stumpin'
[00:08:18] Starts at 10 pm
[00:08:19] So that's it.
That's the first 10 elements.
[00:08:21] You know, starting down there
to around here.
[00:08:24] And then the rest of them
upto 118
[00:08:27] go all through the backrooms here
[00:08:29] up through all the classrooms
down there the whole department.
[00:08:32] is holding the rest of these elements.
[00:08:35] So now let's get into
the next step
[00:08:37] which is layering.
[00:08:40] Alright so we've laid the groundwork
[00:08:42] We have the essential elements
[00:08:44] (no pun intended)
[00:08:45] we have the atomic number
and the name.
[00:08:47] Okay.
[00:08:48] Now the next thing I want to memorize
[00:08:50] are the atomic mass and
the boiling point.
[00:08:53] Right?
Which is a set of numbers.
[00:08:54] So where do I put them?
[00:08:56] In a separate membrane palace?
[00:08:57] No, what you can do is 
layer them on top of
[00:09:00] what you have already placed
[00:09:02] along the path that we just used.
[00:09:04] How do you do that?
Well, once you've learned
[00:09:06] what you put there,
you just walk though it
[00:09:08] and go back 
and place new images
[00:09:10] on top of what you already put there.
[00:09:13] And when I say put them on top,
I mean elaborate the story.
[00:09:17] Connect them in some way
[00:09:18] or introduce them into the image
that you already have there.
[00:09:21] So you are just adding
more contacts
[00:09:23] more details and that will
in turn help you remember
[00:09:26] the extra stuff that 
you are putting there.
[00:09:27] Namely the mass and
the temperature.
[00:09:30] Which leads me to
step number four.
[00:09:36] Step number four is chunking.
[00:09:39] And this is kind of
inlined with being smart with your data
[00:09:41] Obviously now, I have to
[00:09:43] figure out
how to memorize two-digit number
[00:09:46] Well, I had three digit sometimes
[00:09:47] for the atomic mass
[00:09:49] and then the boiling point
which- if you look at this list
[00:09:52] it's a mixture of two digit numbers
all the way upto four.
[00:09:55] So what I could do is say, 
I have a system that let me
[00:09:59] memorize six- seven- eight digit
numbers
[00:10:03] So why not use that
[00:10:05] ...as this?
[00:10:06] The atomic mass will be 
the first part of the image
[00:10:08] and then the boiling point
will be the second or third part
[00:10:11] of that image.
[00:10:12] Namely, my personal system
is the PAO
[00:10:16] A person, reaction
and object.
[00:10:18] So all know that my person
is always dealing with the atomic mass.
[00:10:23] And then the action or the action
and object or just object
[00:10:26] will deal with the boiling point-
whatever the size of that number is.
[00:10:29] You need to have a number system
to make this a lot easier
[00:10:32] If you don't have that, you are
gonna be a bit stuck.
[00:10:34] But I think anybody and everybody 
should have a number system
[00:10:37] and if you don't have one,
you should go back
[00:10:39] and watch my videos on
how to make one.
[00:10:40] So let's go back over our
few of those examples
[00:10:42] that we already
did for the groundwork
[00:10:44] and introduce
or layer
[00:10:46] that extra information
on top of it.
[00:10:48] And what that would look like?
[00:10:51] Alright, so coming back here
[00:10:53] to the stairs, right?
That was location number one.
[00:10:54] We had Hydrogen there.
[00:10:56] What we're gonna add on top of that
is the atomic mass
[00:10:58] and the boiling point.
[00:11:00] Alright? Which in this case
is just
[00:11:02] 1- That's the mass
and the boiling point is 20.
[00:11:05] Using my number system,
I translate the one into a person
[00:11:08] that's Alice in Wonderland
[00:11:09] and the 20 is either
and action or an object
[00:11:12] in this case, it's putting on glasses.
[00:11:14] Alright.. Sunglasses.
[00:11:15] So, I interact that new image
[00:11:18] or layer it
onto what I have there
[00:11:20] which was water coming down, right?
[00:11:22] Hydrogen, hydrate, H₂O
[00:11:25] That's what the water was.
[00:11:26] So I have Alice in Wonderland
[00:11:27] kind of
[00:11:29] chilling, putting some glasses on.
[00:11:31] And that was a pretty simple one.
[00:11:33] Alright. Another one where the 
boiling point is actually a four digit number
[00:11:37] Okay
[00:11:37] and that's for Lithium 
we have
[00:11:39] 7, that's the mass, which is
James Bond
[00:11:42] and the boiling point is 1615
[00:11:44] One thousand
six hundred and fifteen.
[00:11:46] And so I translate that
into an action
[00:11:48] two digit action
and a two digit object.
[00:11:50] So it would be James Bond
weightlifting
[00:11:53] a chalkboard.
[00:11:54] 1615.
[00:11:55] Now I gotta somehow relate to
what I put there
[00:11:57] which was Lithium batteries
attached to the bike rack.
[00:12:01] So maybe those batteries 
are plugged into James Bond
[00:12:04] and they allows him to be
superhuman
[00:12:07] in strength.
[00:12:07] Being able to lift
or pump iron
[00:12:10] with these chalkboards
that are super heavy.
[00:12:21] Alright, so step number 5
[00:12:23] is to do something
that I call
[00:12:25] parallel storage.
[00:12:26] And I borrowed this idea from
[00:12:29] computer science
because sometimes you have
[00:12:31] arrays which stores data
[00:12:33] and sometimes you use
parallel separate arrays
[00:12:37] to kind of help you pair
information
[00:12:40] from the same set
[00:12:41] if that makes any sense...
[00:12:42] So what do I mean by that?
[00:12:43] The arrays in this example
are your memory palaces.
[00:12:46] When I look at this data
[00:12:48] the names and the dates of discovery
[00:12:50] trouble me..
[00:12:51] 'cause they are complicated, right?
[00:12:52] It's a bunch- It's another
four digit number
[00:12:54] and the names are long and French
and complicated
[00:12:57] So I- I feel uncomfortable layering it
[00:12:59] on top of
what I already put there.
[00:13:01] You could do it.
[00:13:02] But then, each image now
gets really bogged down
[00:13:05] So in my mind
[00:13:07] sometimes, I'll
just do a separate memory palace.
[00:13:10] And the position in that palace
will just
[00:13:12] mirror the position
for the element that represents
[00:13:15] in the other memory palace.
[00:13:16] So Hydrogen, location 1
in memory palace 1
[00:13:20] will pertain to the first location
[00:13:23] of the separate or parallel memory palace.
[00:13:25] And whatever information
is there.
[00:13:26] So if I want to know the 
creator or discoverer or whatever
[00:13:29] of element number 5
[00:13:31] I would go to the fifth location
[00:13:33] in my second memory palace to
get the name or the year.
[00:13:36] And then I would know 
in the first memory palace
[00:13:38] .. you know the other information
pertaining to that specific element.
[00:13:41] So it's the location
within the memory palace
[00:13:44] -whichever memory palace I'm using-
that tells me across the two
[00:13:47] which one I'm dealing with.
[00:13:49] They are the same.
[00:13:49] So for this one, 
I can't quite take you there
[00:13:52] because I actually used for 
the parallel memory palace
[00:13:55] I used Everest base camp.
[00:13:56] So in general, don't be afraid
to use separate memory palaces
[00:13:59] to store information
related to the same thing.
[00:14:03] So there you have it.
[00:14:04] All of those five tips are kinda
what went into me
[00:14:07] memorizing
that massive amount of information.
[00:14:09] Thanks for watching.
I hope you enjoyed this video
[00:14:11] I hope it was helpful
[00:14:12] and that you are
able to use some of
[00:14:13] the tools and the
tips that I gave you in this video
[00:14:16] ...to not just memorize the elements
[00:14:17] and maybe I'll do another video
that actually shows how to memorize
[00:14:20] all the atomic numbers and
all the elements
[00:14:22] but you can use it for anything.
[00:14:24] Doesn't have to
be elements.
[00:14:25] Some of the tips I used
are universal
[00:14:27] for memorizing 
just anything big
[00:14:29] complicated with many layers.
[00:14:30] For the long term.

=== My Wife Recaps LORD OF THE RINGS…from Memory ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fryw-qIW_3k

[00:00:00] all right what's up guys i'm here with
[00:00:01] my wife
[00:00:02] leah
[00:00:03] what's up guys
[00:00:06] cool it down anyways it's lord of the
[00:00:09] rings time no okay
[00:00:11] i wanted her to see the films because
[00:00:13] they mean a lot to me
[00:00:14] and i thought it'd be fun to see how her
[00:00:17] memory is of what this film
[00:00:21] is
[00:00:22] how it goes what she remembers it as we
[00:00:25] all know i have a good memory my wife
[00:00:27] has a pretty good memory but not
[00:00:29] probably for lord of the rings things
[00:00:32] correct all right so this is lord of the
[00:00:34] rings the fellowship of the ring the
[00:00:36] first one what a treat according to my
[00:00:38] wife's memory
[00:00:40] [Music]
[00:00:45] there was a baddie
[00:00:48] sauron
[00:00:50] sauron and he had a ring and it was
[00:00:53] the ring that ruled everyone and ever
[00:00:57] everyone wanted this ring it was the
[00:00:59] ring but it was also really bad
[00:01:03] it made you do evil things and it made
[00:01:05] you
[00:01:06] i don't know it just made you do evil
[00:01:07] things and it was going to destroy
[00:01:09] humanity so they were in a battle
[00:01:12] there were like like some of his people
[00:01:14] in a battle and then there were like the
[00:01:15] good guys and his finger came off and
[00:01:18] sauron was dead they thought oh my god
[00:01:22] but then
[00:01:24] it turns out he's still
[00:01:27] well the ring got taken by the great
[00:01:30] great great great great grandma
[00:01:34] of argonne
[00:01:36] aragorn okay what was this great great
[00:01:38] great great great great great
[00:01:40] grandfather's name
[00:01:41] it's so bad
[00:01:45] there's something with an eye wasn't it
[00:01:46] is that the part where the other guy
[00:01:47] gets the ring it was like dropped in the
[00:01:49] water schmiegel yeah it was also known
[00:01:51] as why do they all have two names i mean
[00:01:55] am i right or am i right after this i
[00:01:57] want a list of everyone can't no
[00:01:59] no gondor no go on go on he gets the
[00:02:03] ring and it's very bad very bad it just
[00:02:05] like destroys his life it was not
[00:02:07] discovered again for 500 years until
[00:02:10] bill baggins got it oh this is like
[00:02:12] where he picks up
[00:02:13] so bilbo's having a big retirement party
[00:02:16] because he is turning like 140. okay so
[00:02:18] he's having this big retirement party
[00:02:20] but he doesn't tell people that the
[00:02:22] reason he's retiring is because he's
[00:02:24] been faking his age with this ring thing
[00:02:26] then he gets up to an ounce that he's
[00:02:27] leaving and he just puts his ring on and
[00:02:30] like pieces out frodo ran after him and
[00:02:32] was like uncle dude where are you going
[00:02:35] so bilbo left the ring for frodo which i
[00:02:38] feel like was a real dick move because
[00:02:40] that was
[00:02:41] that's a lot of responsibility for a
[00:02:44] nephew
[00:02:45] let's keep moving moving right it's a
[00:02:46] three-hour movie
[00:02:48] frodo's like what do i do with this and
[00:02:50] i've got this house that i don't want
[00:02:52] i've got this ring that i don't want and
[00:02:55] the wizard's like you got to get out of
[00:02:56] here still like where the wizard didn't
[00:02:58] exactly tell him where to go or like
[00:03:00] what this ring means well he didn't know
[00:03:02] to be fair he had to do some research
[00:03:04] okay so
[00:03:06] frodo pieces out with
[00:03:08] his little sidekick samwell
[00:03:11] nope wrong series sam wise sam y is
[00:03:14] gamgee and they
[00:03:16] disappear with the ring because they're
[00:03:17] gonna they don't even know where they're
[00:03:19] going well the baddies are after them so
[00:03:21] they're just supposed to hide off there
[00:03:22] gandalf's gonna meet them no problem
[00:03:26] gandalf doesn't mean that okay
[00:03:28] in the meantime gandalf goes and talks
[00:03:30] to this other wizard and this other
[00:03:31] wizard is like i am sauron's
[00:03:35] person now
[00:03:37] and like slams doris and everything
[00:03:40] what's his name it's like something very
[00:03:42] similar it's like
[00:03:45] sour patch
[00:03:47] toronto
[00:03:51] sour mom thank you why would they make
[00:03:53] the bad guy and the other bad guy have
[00:03:55] similar names okay so sarah mon is
[00:03:58] basically like just kidding i'm a bad
[00:04:00] guy you didn't know this you thought we
[00:04:02] were friends and
[00:04:03] holds gandalf there so gandalf can't go
[00:04:06] meet frodo and his little friend they're
[00:04:08] like oh my god he forgot about us
[00:04:10] and in the meantime
[00:04:12] craziness ensues because the ring is
[00:04:14] wanted at a pub and then he like pops it
[00:04:16] on and disappears
[00:04:18] and then
[00:04:20] the good looking guy
[00:04:21] that's aragon yeah hides them
[00:04:24] in a little bed or not in a little bit
[00:04:27] in a little secret
[00:04:28] room
[00:04:30] so that the
[00:04:31] the baddies can't get them that night
[00:04:33] who are the baddies
[00:04:34] the ring wreaths they're like saurons
[00:04:37] peeps nazguls all right so then as
[00:04:39] ghouls are like stabbing beds just
[00:04:41] getting its feathers aragorn is like
[00:04:44] i'll get you somewhere safe and he takes
[00:04:45] them to riverdale
[00:04:47] and it's that's where the people with
[00:04:49] the they're not elves no they are elves
[00:04:52] i still don't understand and the elves
[00:04:55] all hungry air okay so they get there oh
[00:04:58] no frodo got stabbed on the whip
[00:05:00] i forgot that and liv tyler fixed him
[00:05:04] her father is l ron hubbard great
[00:05:05] nemanja yep the elf people are there
[00:05:08] having a great time and they're like oh
[00:05:10] by the way gandalf got here they're
[00:05:12] about to leave and gandalf's like we're
[00:05:14] just gonna leave the ring here and l
[00:05:15] ron's like no no no no
[00:05:18] you can't leave this ring here it causes
[00:05:20] problems and he's like let's have a
[00:05:21] little
[00:05:23] committee and we'll all talk about it
[00:05:25] that's the part with ned stark
[00:05:28] okay so then there's like a circle of
[00:05:30] all these people that are like what are
[00:05:31] we gonna do with the ring nobody can
[00:05:33] decide what to do with the ring because
[00:05:34] basically you have to get rid of it they
[00:05:35] have to bring it to
[00:05:38] moto so then they form this little
[00:05:41] band of nine people and they're like
[00:05:43] let's all do it together frodo's not so
[00:05:45] sure because he sees the power it was uh
[00:05:47] becoming distracting during that initial
[00:05:49] meeting and he knows that it's going to
[00:05:50] be a problem from here on out they start
[00:05:52] up a big snowy mountain and then sauron
[00:05:55] from like far away is like
[00:05:58] creates avalanches and snow and it's not
[00:06:00] going to be the way that they can get to
[00:06:02] mordor kimly's like you guys i have this
[00:06:04] cousin and he's a great host and he's
[00:06:07] gonna take us in these minds of morya
[00:06:10] gandalf's like i wouldn't take people
[00:06:12] down there i don't want to do this oh
[00:06:13] wait and frodo decided that they can do
[00:06:15] it they get to the mines amoria there's
[00:06:17] a riddle on the door gandalf can't
[00:06:19] figure it out but frodo nails it boom
[00:06:21] the door opens turns out there's a whole
[00:06:23] bunch of skeletons in there so they go
[00:06:25] in why oh wasn't there like a river
[00:06:27] snake or something that was gonna kill
[00:06:29] it takes him a minute to realize that
[00:06:31] his cousin's like not gonna be there
[00:06:33] and then they're like okay we're gonna
[00:06:35] push through there's only one exit
[00:06:37] terrible things called orcs come out and
[00:06:39] they're all fighting all fighting all
[00:06:40] fighting and then was there like a
[00:06:42] trapdoor i remember at one point
[00:06:44] gandalf's like this is the way you use
[00:06:46] your nose it doesn't smell over here oh
[00:06:48] oh this is the part where gandalf
[00:06:52] they're running away the bridge breaks
[00:06:54] gandalf goes back
[00:06:56] he slays this monster and then the
[00:06:58] monster comes up and grabs him gandalf's
[00:07:00] gone now now they're down to eight
[00:07:03] and
[00:07:05] i don't know where they went oh they
[00:07:06] dispersed to go get supplies and stuff
[00:07:08] like firewood and food right
[00:07:10] they're like separate for a bit then
[00:07:12] that's when frodo runs back into
[00:07:15] for me i was like you shouldn't be all
[00:07:17] alone in the woods little boy they have
[00:07:19] like a weird thing boromir tries to
[00:07:21] fight him to get the ring aragon runs
[00:07:23] into frodo aragon's like no no i'm here
[00:07:26] to protect you
[00:07:27] you need to go on your own because we
[00:07:29] know that the ring is too powerful
[00:07:30] nobody can go with you
[00:07:32] just kidding sam wise is going with you
[00:07:34] they turn around and fight all the orcs
[00:07:36] mary and pip get taken by the orcs bear
[00:07:39] amir horomir gets killed by like the
[00:07:42] head orc aragon comes by and
[00:07:46] takes down that guy and then gives
[00:07:49] boromir a sword so he can have it on his
[00:07:51] chest he said that was the thing i was
[00:07:52] like why is he doing that that makes no
[00:07:54] sense i didn't talk enough about legolas
[00:07:56] though he and his great hair are like
[00:07:58] we're gonna go get mary and pip and then
[00:08:00] they're all seen getting into canoes oh
[00:08:02] and samwell swims up to frodo and gets
[00:08:05] in his canoe and he's like we are doing
[00:08:06] this together he doesn't have that
[00:08:08] accent but that's what he says he's like
[00:08:10] i told you i wasn't gonna leave you
[00:08:11] alone here i am he's like the most unfit
[00:08:14] person you like wouldn't want him on

=== How to FOOL a MEMORY CHAMPION... ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzpVTETTPmA

[00:00:00] Here we go.
It's early in the morning.
[00:00:01] First time, I am gonna try.
Here we go.
[00:00:04] We know hearts is missing.
[00:00:08] Queen of hearts.
That's flash memory.
[00:00:10] Except it's not.
[00:00:13] So the reason I show this trick
is because a few weeks ago,
[00:00:16] at the USA memory championship,
[00:00:18] I saw someone perform this trick.
[00:00:21] And it pissed me off.
[00:00:22] Now, there's nothing wrong with magic.
I freaking love magic.
[00:00:26] But here's the thing!
[00:00:27] Here's what really makes me angry.
[00:00:29] When someone does
a magic trick,
[00:00:32] pretending that it is a memory trick-
[00:00:35] And I know.. You know, magic acts,
they- they don't-
[00:00:38] It's all- It's- It's a magic act.
[00:00:40] So you don't say...
"Hey this is all the trick."
[00:00:42] It's just implied
because you are a magician.
[00:00:45] Or you are a mentalist.
[00:00:46] We kind of know underneath it all
that there is a trick.
[00:00:50] We suspend belief
but we know..
[00:00:51] they're good at their craft,
they're fooling us somehow.
[00:00:54] They don't even have to say,
Hey...
[00:00:55] by the way everything you're
about to see is a magic trick
[00:00:58] Don't believe this...
[00:00:59] The goal of the magician or any
mentalist is to make you believe,
[00:01:02] that what they're doing
is really just explain it.
[00:01:04] But there's something different
if you're coming from at an angle where,
[00:01:07] you're saying...
[00:01:08] I'm a Memory,
[00:01:10] trained you know,
experienced!
[00:01:12] All I do is train my memory,
I have all these techniques.
[00:01:15] Then you do a trick, a magic trick..
[00:01:17] to pretend that you're
showing off your memory.
[00:01:19] That is- is... really bad.
[00:01:21] And I- I... I can't stand for it!
[00:01:24] So, have to make this video
[00:01:25] because apparently, this is
what my channel does now is..
[00:01:28] We looked at things
and react to things and...
[00:01:31] give commentary on it!
[00:01:33] So we're gonna look
at the actual footage!
[00:01:35] So you can see what actually happened.
[00:01:37] I'm gonna walk you through
it and show you why it's fake!
[00:01:39] And then I'm gonna
show you, how he does it.
[00:01:41] Alright, let's roll the tape!
[00:01:44] A little caveat here..
[00:01:45] I don't want to bash anybody,
[00:01:48] by name and destroy their whole
you know credibility whatever.
[00:01:52] So I'm gonna try my
best not to name names,
[00:01:56] obviously the person
is gonna be in the video.
[00:01:57] But I'm not going to go into
their life and what they do..
[00:02:00] that's up to you if you
wanna research that!
[00:02:02] Please view this video
as, I saw something...
[00:02:05] in the space that I work
at a Memory Championship.
[00:02:07] That really bothered me,
because it was fake
[00:02:10] where I had an inkling it was faked
and I'm commenting on that, okay?
[00:02:13] From the person's
perspective who did it,
[00:02:15] they put that out there,
for the world to see
[00:02:18] that was their choice!
[00:02:19] I'm just reacting to what
they put out there.
[00:02:22] They wanna do something
that's questionable or fake..
[00:02:25] then it should be open to scrutiny.
[00:02:26] No, that fare?
[00:02:28] Okay.
[00:02:30] Roll the tape now..
[00:02:30] As you prepare for
the flash recognition,
[00:02:35] demonstration...
[00:02:36] So first, a little
bit of context here.
[00:02:38] On the left you've a...
[00:02:40] uhh well known, (I
respect him) good guy,
[00:02:43] researcher in brain and neuroscience.
[00:02:46] Okay, he knows this stuff.
[00:02:47] And, on the right
you've a Magician/Mentalist
[00:02:51] with history or dabbling
in memory techniques.
[00:02:55] But what's interesting is...
[00:02:57] They've worked together and,
[00:02:59] clearly he's done demonstrations
for the guy from MIT.
[00:03:04] And he's calling this demonstration,
flash memory.
[00:03:07] Okay.
[00:03:08] And you can imagine
what they actually means
[00:03:10] it's flashing something and
remembering what was flashed.
[00:03:13] It's kind of like a
photographic memory which,
[00:03:16] as you all know, I
don't think it really exists.
[00:03:18] Many memory athletes will
tell you that it doesn't exist.
[00:03:21] Or it does in very very
few very rare cases..
[00:03:24] but it's definitely not
something that you can train
[00:03:27] to the extent that
you're going to see here.
[00:03:28] So what he's going to show
you is some ancillary... skill
[00:03:32] that he picked up..
[00:03:34] by memorizing cards
so often in his life.
[00:03:37] Both in terms of
entertainment purposes
[00:03:40] and memory purposes.
[00:03:42] Cards have almost taken on a
new existence in his brain,
[00:03:46] where he can do
something with them...
[00:03:48] that nobody else in the world can do.
[00:03:51] And it's a flash recognition cast.
[00:03:53] First of all, there's nobody
that is memorizing cards
[00:03:56] more than us...
Memory athletes!
[00:04:00] This is what we do,
there's an event we trained for
[00:04:02] we get faster and faster.
[00:04:04] I can't tell how many
thousands and thousands of
[00:04:06] decks of cards I've
memorized in my life.
[00:04:08] And I don't even do it
as much as many other people.
[00:04:11] So there's no way that this guy
is memorizing cards..
[00:04:14] more than we're.
[00:04:15] Being someone who is trained
memorizing cards everyday
[00:04:17] I'll tell you that ancillary...
[00:04:19] benefit of training cards
does not make you better
[00:04:23] at just naturally seeing it.
[00:04:25] And memorizing cards,
[00:04:26] there are no fringe benefits
as they'll call it here.
[00:04:29] You know, yes I can
look at cards and...
[00:04:31] and come up with an image faster.
[00:04:33] But I can't really memorize them,
[00:04:35] any more naturally...
[00:04:37] than I could when
I first did this.
[00:04:39] I still have to do the process,
[00:04:40] I still have to process them
after looking all the cards
[00:04:43] and yes I can get
faster at that but...
[00:04:45] the process still is the same.
[00:04:47] There is no learned flash
memory for cards now.
[00:04:51] I can't do that
I don't think anybody can.
[00:04:54] He's going to be able
to very quickly identify
[00:04:57] which one is missing.
[00:04:58] Alright, so just to give you
the back story you kind of miss it there.
[00:05:01] The trick is this guy is
going to lay out all the cards.
[00:05:04] Look at them really quickly
and take them away.
[00:05:06] And then, be able to basically
say which card is missing
[00:05:09] if one is taken out at random.
[00:05:11] Very quickly like in a flash..
[00:05:13] Go ahead and take it over.
[00:05:14] Yeah it's not really memory
it's something that...
[00:05:17] is one of the...
one of the French benefits.
[00:05:19] Okay, first of all
it's not even memory?
[00:05:21] It's exactly memory.
[00:05:22] So why would you say that?
[00:05:23] One other thing that it's very
important doing the memory stuff,
[00:05:27] it really helps with the
anxiety, stress.
[00:05:30] I mean this is the
coolest thing and..
[00:05:31] as Tony said it
stimulates the creativity.
[00:05:34] Now if I was there in person
it's much better,
[00:05:36] you can borrow a deck of cards
you mix them up like this.
[00:05:39] We'll talk about this more
in depth but at first I thought,
[00:05:42] you know, this could
easily be a fake shuffle.
[00:05:44] Right?
[00:05:45] Uh I don't think it is right here..
[00:05:47] Actually I'm pretty sure it's not...
[00:05:49] Um but if you're pretty good
magician or card handler,
[00:05:52] that would be the
easiest thing to do right?
[00:05:55] Just have it pre-memorized a stack
[00:05:57] and just do some false shuffles so...
[00:06:00] it's you know the order, no matter
how many times you shuffle right?
[00:06:03] But let's keep watching...
[00:06:04] You cut them and I hope
everybody can see them.
[00:06:06] Alright now Robert, I'm
going to cut the deck in half
[00:06:08] and you've one and two
which one should I use?
[00:06:11] We're just going to do which one?
[00:06:12] Use two!
[00:06:13] Two okay, now watch
I'll try it here we go...
[00:06:18] Alright!
[00:06:19] I'm gonna go like this, you just
say stop anytime you want Robert.
[00:06:27] Stop!
[00:06:28] You want to do this
card or this card?
[00:06:30] Umm... the one on the table.
[00:06:33] Alright, we're going to put it right there.
[00:06:34] Everybody could see it...
[00:06:36] I'm just going to go
like this you can mix up the cards
[00:06:38] that they're not in
that same predicament
[00:06:40] it has nothing to do with that.
[00:06:42] Here we go, it's
early in the morning
[00:06:43] first time I'm going
to try here we go...
[00:06:47] Queen of hearts is missing!
[00:06:49] Definitely... there it is
Queen of hearts.
[00:06:51] That's flash memory.
[00:06:53] That's flash memory folks!
[00:06:56] Okay, let's reverse...
[00:06:58] Let's unpack for a second here.
[00:07:00] This just boils my blood.
[00:07:02] If if if... he was just
saying I'm a magician
[00:07:04] and this was a memory act not...
[00:07:07] uh a Ted Talk in the middle of
a Memory competition
[00:07:10] preaching that you
can do this too with
[00:07:12] just training your memory.
[00:07:14] That is wrong and flat out deceiving.
[00:07:16] Let's look back
at the trick itself...
[00:07:19] So like I said,
the shuffle first of all
[00:07:21] ...the creativity.
[00:07:22] Now if I was there in person
it's much better,
[00:07:24] you can borrow a deck of cards
you mix them up like this.
[00:07:27] Alright, you cut them and I hope
everybody can see them.
[00:07:29] Alright now Robert, I'm
going to cut the deck in half...
[00:07:32] So now, why does he
cut the deck in half?
[00:07:33] I think that... you know
[00:07:36] he's flirting with the line
of something that's just
[00:07:39] absolutely unbelievable.
[00:07:41] And maybe you know, I can believe..
[00:07:45] someone who's
trained this can do this.
[00:07:46] So if he were to have
done the full deck
[00:07:48] I think he'd have lot more questions.
[00:07:50] So, he's clever...
[00:07:52] because he's gonna make
it you know half a deck, 26 cards.
[00:07:55] Okay, that's more reasonable alright.
[00:07:57] I think that's why he does that.
[00:07:58] One and two which one
should I use? which one?
[00:08:02] Use two!
[00:08:03] two okay...
[00:08:04] And now yeah,
you know he's shuffling
[00:08:05] he's letting the scientist choose
which one he wants...
[00:08:09] He's giving the..
the appearance that
[00:08:12] a lot of it is out of his control
and totally random right?
[00:08:16] Now watch
I'll try it here we go...
[00:08:20] So here, he's memorizing, right?
[00:08:22] This is what he's doing..
[00:08:23] Call what you want
maybe he's...
[00:08:25] gonna explain it like he doesn't
know all the cards that are there.
[00:08:28] But he has to right?
[00:08:29] To be able to know which
one is pulled out of there...
[00:08:32] You have to know..
[00:08:34] what cards are there.
[00:08:35] So he has to look at all
the cards here and I-
[00:08:37] I wouldn't even say if you zoom in.
[00:08:40] Like some of these cards are
very hard to read
[00:08:43] because they are not equally spaced.
[00:08:44] And if you look, I mean...
[00:08:46] He goes this right?
2, 3 times...
[00:08:48] You can't process,
let's say that 26 cards
[00:08:51] in a fraction of a second.
[00:08:53] That's just impossible!
[00:08:54] Alright...
[00:08:56] I'm gonna go like
this, you just say stop anytime
[00:08:58] -you want Robert. -And again here
is just another attempt to make
[00:09:01] -the viewer being like.. this
is totally random my choice. -Stop!
[00:09:04] You want to do this
card or this card?
[00:09:07] Umm... the one on the table.
[00:09:09] Alright, we're going
to put it right there.
[00:09:11] Everybody could see it?
[00:09:12] I'm just going to go
like this you can mix up the cards
[00:09:14] that they're not in...
[00:09:15] Now he's shuffling it?
[00:09:16] Like what... what reason
would you have to do this?
[00:09:19] If he had memorized,
he would have memorized the order.
[00:09:21] Now he's saying that not only
did he not memorized the order
[00:09:25] He just knows all the cards
that were there...
[00:09:28] from those 2 seconds
that he went back and forth.
[00:09:31] It's just impossible!
[00:09:32] same predicament it
has nothing to do with that.
[00:09:35] Here we go, it's
early in the morning
[00:09:37] first time I'm going
to try here we go...
[00:09:40] Queen of hearts is missing!
[00:09:42] That one...
[00:09:42] And you see like, he moves
a couple of cards there
[00:09:45] yeah he's gotta somewhat
make it like he's actually gotta
[00:09:47] look at the cards even
more wild than that...
[00:09:50] is that he starts
to say the answer,
[00:09:52] the Queen of hearts...
[00:09:54] Before he's even like, checked
that those 2 cards he moved
[00:09:57] were the Queen of hearts...
[00:09:58] So stupid!
[00:10:00] Queen of hearts,
that's flash memory.
[00:10:02] -yeah just to emphasize...
-I've no idea how this works.
[00:10:05] That is flash memory.
[00:10:06] I've no idea how it works.
[00:10:09] Would you say
it's a divine power?
[00:10:11] I feel like I've heard this before.
[00:10:12] And when it's too
good to be true...
[00:10:14] usually is!
[00:10:15] -It is not a magic trick although
-No
[00:10:17] -it's capable of doing magic tricks.
-No...
[00:10:19] We've tested this if you
were in person you could see...
[00:10:22] what he's doing is a recognition task.
[00:10:24] And this is often
done in psychology
[00:10:26] where you do some
kind of parallel processing
[00:10:29] you walk into a room you
don't notice all the details.
[00:10:31] But if you step out and they
remove something and you walk in
[00:10:34] you're able to
determine what's missing
[00:10:37] from a type of parallel
computation that your brain is doing.
[00:10:40] Yes yes... Yes
[00:10:42] that is a thing.
[00:10:43] And that is something
that we can do
[00:10:45] Can you train it to an extent?
Probably...
[00:10:48] But not with cards that's just
too much abstract information.
[00:10:51] And too fast...too fast
[00:10:53] Uh... to be believable here.
[00:10:54] Then as you see, he processed it
in like... 2 seconds
[00:10:58] which is extraordinary.
[00:11:00] Not even!
[00:11:00] And it's almost hard to believe that
any human being can do that.
[00:11:04] Because it can't be done
by any human being.
[00:11:06] And I won't say that everyone
of you would be able to do that...
[00:11:09] No one can.
[00:11:10] But the point is that
you can do things that would surprise
[00:11:13] and shock yourself
[00:11:15] with a relatively
minimal degree of training.
[00:11:18] True! But not this.
[00:11:20] And you know, I picked
this up Robert like...
[00:11:23] doing the memory stuff and
being a Police officer in the past.
[00:11:26] I picked this up...
[00:11:27] flash recognition training.
[00:11:29] And I thought you know we did it
with license plates and things like that.
[00:11:32] But from enhancing my
memory over the years
[00:11:35] and doing this cognitive fitness
these cognitive fitness exercises.
[00:11:38] It's just I tried
with cards one day
[00:11:41] and it was like wow, you
can do this with cards.
[00:11:43] I mean like this is like insane
I mean you can...
[00:11:46] this is like I mean it's
so easy to do like I mean...
[00:11:48] It's just so easy to do.
[00:11:51] Why would you even say that?
[00:11:52] Why?
[00:11:53] We'll do do it like that
we'll spread them out.
[00:11:55] Do the whole second half of the deck...
[00:11:59] Alright close it up
[00:12:00] Ready?
[00:12:01] Once again Robert say Stop.
[00:12:05] I'll close my eyes...
[00:12:07] Stop!
[00:12:08] Which one?
On the table or in my hand?
[00:12:10] In your hand!
[00:12:11] Alright put it right there,
I even close my eyes
[00:12:14] mix them up again.
[00:12:15] He even closes his eyes. Wow!
[00:12:18] And at this point I've no idea
what that is yet..
[00:12:20] Nope, actually in that moment
he now knows what it is.
[00:12:24] Ready?
[00:12:26] Bingo... 2 of Club.
[00:12:29] Folks, this is the
coolest thing in the world.
[00:12:32] All your memory athletes
here, can do this easily.
[00:12:36] They should get into this..
[00:12:37] We can't. I'm telling you
I can't do this...
[00:12:40] I can't do that.. well
I can do this trick.
[00:12:43] But I can't do that with
my memory unfortunately.
[00:12:46] And I guarantee you
the top memorizer...
[00:12:48] I'm not the top card memorizer.
[00:12:49] They are people who can
do it in half the time I can.
[00:12:52] 12 13 seconds, they
can do this either.
[00:12:55] Maybe with less cards,
maybe...
[00:12:57] Maybe with like... 10 cards possibly.
[00:13:00] But not a half deck.
[00:13:02] Not a half deck...
[00:13:03] Alright, uh that's enough for that.
Let's go to the tutorial.
[00:13:07] Alright, so here we go!
[00:13:09] We've a deck of cards, alright?
[00:13:12] Whatever....
[00:13:13] And...
[00:13:15] you know, we gonna shuffle.
[00:13:17] Look at this,
this is flash memory.
[00:13:19] We're gonna split it
in half... as he said,
[00:13:22] alright, let's do the first deck
put that over here.
[00:13:26] Memorize it,
Blah blah...blah.
[00:13:28] I'm not even memorizing
not even memorizing.
[00:13:30] But I'm pretending
like I'm memorizing.
[00:13:32] Okay?
[00:13:33] Do that as fast as you think,
[00:13:34] you need to have make
your audience happy right?
[00:13:37] And then, you know
tell them one to stop.
[00:13:44] You can ask them,
which card they want...
[00:13:46] Let's say it's this one.
[00:13:48] Hey put that to that side..
[00:13:49] and then you know,
like he did it.
[00:13:52] Shuffle it over.
[00:13:53] And then...
[00:13:56] real quick, King of Clubs!
[00:14:01] In other words,
[00:14:04] can you see that?
[00:14:06] "King of Clubs"
[00:14:12] This are marked cards!
[00:14:13] Every single one of them
says what card it is on the back.
[00:14:16] I mean there's different ways
cards can be marked right?
[00:14:19] This one's pretty
blatant, that actually says...
[00:14:21] This is the 5 of Hearts.
[00:14:22] This is the 3 of Spades.
[00:14:25] This is the 3 of Hearts.
[00:14:27] So when I'm looking
and saying Hey...
[00:14:28] This card or this card?
[00:14:30] Oh this one, Yeah
the King of Clubs.
[00:14:32] This is the easiest
trick to do in the world.
[00:14:34] All your memory athletes
here, can do this easily.
[00:14:40] Now, here is the
thing what if it was...
[00:14:42] just a pre-memorized stack?
[00:14:44] Well same kind of thing here.
[00:14:46] Let's put this down,
[00:14:47] you know he'd have...
[00:14:48] shuffled, he could have
done false shuffles here.
[00:14:51] They can be easily done and...
[00:14:53] and they can look
as real as a normal shuffle
[00:14:56] right?
[00:14:56] So let's say he did
that...And it's the same order
[00:14:59] You know, he splits it in half.
[00:15:00] Maybe he knows
exactly where he's cut it
[00:15:02] so that he show them.
[00:15:04] Right?
[00:15:05] That's really does nothing because
he knows the order already
[00:15:09] then as you count
them out,1 2 3 4 5 6...
[00:15:13] 7 okay.
[00:15:14] So this one or this
one, 7 or 8 card?
[00:15:17] He knows already what it is!
[00:15:19] He knows already what it is.
[00:15:22] Anyways um... again
[00:15:24] to the person in the video...
[00:15:26] If you wanna argue
that I'm wrong!
[00:15:30] Please let's chat, I
would love to do a video.
[00:15:32] This is what my
channel does now...
[00:15:33] I interview people
who seem to be phony
[00:15:36] in their memory
demonstrations and I try to...
[00:15:39] show that or expose that.
[00:15:41] Because it's only fair right?
[00:15:42] Nobody deserves
to be tricked right?
[00:15:44] And again if you're in
the setting of a magic trick
[00:15:47] or magic show... You
want to be tricked.
[00:15:49] That's kind of the magic of magic.
[00:15:50] But if you're there to learn about memory
and to believe in memory techniques
[00:15:54] or a product about memory or
to buy someone's book about memory.
[00:15:58] It's... it's deceiving
and you're
[00:16:01] tricking people into
believing things that aren't real.
[00:16:04] You're over promising what's possible.
[00:16:06] I'm not saying that memory
techniques can't take you far
[00:16:08] but there's a limit.
[00:16:10] You can't memorize
everything like a tape recorder.
[00:16:15] That's it for the video. I hope
that was some what interesting...
[00:16:17] Oh...
[00:16:19] If you wanna know, where
to get those marked cards
[00:16:21] I'll put the link in the description
so that you can buy your own set.
[00:16:23] Just don't say you're
doing a memory trick.
[00:16:26] No, I don't even
want you to say that.
[00:16:27] You can do that. Just be
clear that you, I don't know...
[00:16:30] Do whatever you
want. Just don't do like that.
[00:16:32] I'm out.

[00:00:00] what's up guys today's gonna be a fun
[00:00:02] video we are going to react
[00:00:04] to some legit guinness verified more or
[00:00:08] less world record records oh
[00:00:11] in memory specifically
[00:00:13] now there's tons and tons if not
[00:00:16] hundreds of guinness world records and
[00:00:18] most of them
[00:00:20] are kind of weird longest fingernails
[00:00:22] longest amount of time without sleep i
[00:00:25] could go on there's some weird stuff in
[00:00:26] there but we're gonna focus specifically
[00:00:28] on the memory stuff
[00:00:31] which is impressive these are guinness
[00:00:33] records that have been validated have
[00:00:34] been put through a really rigorous test
[00:00:37] with a lot of conditions and judges and
[00:00:39] all these things that back up a claim
[00:00:41] now that doesn't mean that there is a
[00:00:43] little bit of controversy behind how it
[00:00:45] was done and when it was done and by
[00:00:47] whom it was done so we're gonna look at
[00:00:49] some of these and then at the end i'm
[00:00:51] gonna talk about
[00:00:52] a record that i
[00:00:54] will be trying very soon all the details
[00:00:56] coming up so stay tuned
[00:01:00] all right so let's talk about this
[00:01:01] record on the guinness world records
[00:01:03] page it says day pharaoh that's the who
[00:01:06] the what is 59 total decks of cards
[00:01:09] memorized
[00:01:10] where he did it in canada at ctv studios
[00:01:13] toronto interesting on april 2nd 2007
[00:01:17] and here's the synopsis stay pharaoh
[00:01:19] memorized on single sighting a random
[00:01:21] sequence of 59 separate packs of cards
[00:01:24] that's 3068 cards at ctv studios the
[00:01:27] daily planet toronto canada on 2nd of
[00:01:30] april 2007 the attempt took four hours
[00:01:33] 58 minutes 20 seconds not including
[00:01:35] breaks they've made just one mistake
[00:01:37] during the entire attempt which he
[00:01:38] corrected unprompted here in the studio
[00:01:40] behind me you are watching memory expert
[00:01:42] dave farrow as he's about to set a new
[00:01:45] world record he's been right here at
[00:01:46] discovery channel for the last nine
[00:01:48] hours reciting every single card of a
[00:01:52] record-breaking 59 decks that's more
[00:01:55] than 3 000 cards his job is to remember
[00:01:59] every single one and he's now coming to
[00:02:01] the end of the 59th and final deck let's
[00:02:05] watch
[00:02:07] four of spades and the
[00:02:09] seven no no
[00:02:12] the jack
[00:02:14] that was the second level the jack of
[00:02:16] spades now i will guarantee that this
[00:02:20] was not actually the moment where he did
[00:02:22] that this is television after all
[00:02:24] maybe he finished it just before but
[00:02:26] they had him redo that for show just
[00:02:28] making that very clear
[00:02:31] all right
[00:02:33] hey congratulations come on over here
[00:02:35] dave that is
[00:02:37] i pause
[00:02:38] i struggle for words you know that's
[00:02:41] mind-boggling incredible what was it
[00:02:42] like to do it you've been working on it
[00:02:44] for a long time it's it's like it's like
[00:02:46] a marathon with your brain it really
[00:02:48] it's also he said nine hours he was
[00:02:51] there so then what was the record saying
[00:02:53] the attempt took four hours and 58
[00:02:55] minutes took up nine hours to recite
[00:02:57] them how long did it take to memorize
[00:02:59] all of them took a little over 20 hours
[00:03:01] worth of memorizing we did it over a few
[00:03:03] days 20 hours of memorize over a few
[00:03:06] days
[00:03:07] and nine hours to recall so i don't know
[00:03:09] what exactly is going on with the record
[00:03:11] here where it says it was five hours
[00:03:14] i've only seen them once and it took me
[00:03:16] about 15 minutes per deck to memorize
[00:03:18] this extraordinary test of memory begins
[00:03:21] with the gentle point
[00:03:23] what okay let's take this as face value
[00:03:26] and say that this is completely legit
[00:03:29] which i hope it is since the guinness
[00:03:31] has backed it really impressive 59 decks
[00:03:33] of cards is insane the most i've ever
[00:03:35] done is 31 and that took me
[00:03:40] quite a while i think like four hours or
[00:03:42] something you know this was back in 2007
[00:03:44] i'm assuming he's using some kind of
[00:03:47] person action or person action object or
[00:03:49] not even i don't even know any storing
[00:03:51] each deck of cards in a memory palace
[00:03:54] now i considered once upon a time to
[00:03:56] maybe
[00:03:57] think about doing this record it's just
[00:03:59] a lot of work so i emailed the person
[00:04:02] who had the record before him who was
[00:04:04] dominic o'brien he is a legit
[00:04:07] memory former memory competitor
[00:04:09] eight-time world memory champion tons of
[00:04:12] books out there some that i've even read
[00:04:14] and got inspired by
[00:04:15] so i emailed him when i was considering
[00:04:18] this this was a few years ago and he
[00:04:20] gave me his insight about this record
[00:04:22] because they went back and forth like it
[00:04:24] had said in the interview 54 decks of
[00:04:26] cards was the previous record that was
[00:04:28] dom and then 59 was by dave pharaoh and
[00:04:30] then before dominic i think it was 52 or
[00:04:34] 53 by dave and then before that i think
[00:04:36] it was dominick o'brien as well so they
[00:04:38] went back and forth now here
[00:04:40] he says uh in an email dave came to
[00:04:43] london a few years ago for the wmc he
[00:04:45] had told a group of people that he
[00:04:46] memorized 59 decks with a single
[00:04:48] sighting and it was filmed by guinness
[00:04:50] in canada
[00:04:51] legit so far however he also stated that
[00:04:53] there wasn't enough time to recall all
[00:04:55] the decks for the media to wait
[00:04:57] that is probably very true so we
[00:04:59] answered questions on positions of
[00:05:01] various cards which is what we call a
[00:05:02] matrix attempt not saying everything in
[00:05:05] order but you know saying okay what's
[00:05:07] the 45th deck sixth card still really
[00:05:10] impressive
[00:05:11] but not a full test on whether you know
[00:05:14] everything
[00:05:15] that could be argued therefore as far as
[00:05:17] i'm concerned and by definition this is
[00:05:18] a record in a category of its own
[00:05:21] still impressive
[00:05:23] i get where he's going my record is 54
[00:05:25] decks all shuffled into each other a
[00:05:27] single sighting
[00:05:29] okay which took 12 hours and then
[00:05:32] complete recall of all
[00:05:34] 28.08 cards which took a further three
[00:05:36] hours i made eight errors which is well
[00:05:38] within the half percent margin of error
[00:05:40] i still claim this record today
[00:05:42] interesting so yeah they were allowed a
[00:05:43] half percent error on the amount of
[00:05:46] cards
[00:05:47] that they memorized dominic says i
[00:05:49] thought about going for another record
[00:05:50] of 60 decks to beat the 59 but then
[00:05:52] decided why should i if i still have the
[00:05:53] record
[00:05:55] good point one thing i found it very
[00:05:57] difficult to find were actual vid the
[00:06:00] submitted videos of these guinness
[00:06:02] records like the entire thing and i
[00:06:04] think it's a shame that the guinness
[00:06:05] record page does not allow these for
[00:06:07] viewing it just says here's the stamp of
[00:06:09] approval just believe us and yes they're
[00:06:12] very thorough in how they qualify and
[00:06:15] vet all these claims but they can't be
[00:06:17] perfect so i don't know what to believe
[00:06:20] i don't know anyways
[00:06:22] those are my thoughts on it let's move
[00:06:23] on
[00:06:26] the next record we're going to talk
[00:06:27] about here has to do with memorizing
[00:06:29] random objects
[00:06:30] oh yeah i'm going there guys now it's a
[00:06:32] bit confusing because there are two
[00:06:35] kinds of records that i found on
[00:06:36] guinness
[00:06:38] world records it's most random objects
[00:06:40] memorized and longest sequence of
[00:06:42] objects memorized in one minute the one
[00:06:45] that's most random objects memorized has
[00:06:47] no time limit that's a pretty big number
[00:06:50] the longest sequence of objects
[00:06:51] memorized in one minute obviously it's
[00:06:53] capped by one minute the person who has
[00:06:55] the most random objects memorized let's
[00:06:57] look at that record right now by prajesh
[00:06:59] merlin from india 470
[00:07:02] total objects and he did this in 2012.
[00:07:05] he recalled 470 random items in or in
[00:07:08] the order that they were read to him
[00:07:09] yeah and this is totally doable right if
[00:07:11] somebody were to
[00:07:12] list i've memorized over 300 words in 15
[00:07:16] minutes that's what the time limit here
[00:07:18] doesn't seem that there's a time limit
[00:07:19] so you could just be told that list at
[00:07:22] your own pace 470 items and this has
[00:07:25] been a while ago that's almost 10 years
[00:07:26] ago that this record exists so
[00:07:29] interesting now let's look at the other
[00:07:31] version of this it's the longest
[00:07:32] sequence of objects memorized in one
[00:07:34] minute so this was done by nabal padgear
[00:07:37] 54 total
[00:07:39] items this was done in india on 19th of
[00:07:41] december 2020. although i believe nabal
[00:07:43] is from nepal so does this make him
[00:07:46] the actual memory king
[00:07:50] so 54 items in a minute
[00:07:54] it's not that crazy i've seen people and
[00:07:57] i've done it myself memorize 50 words 50
[00:08:00] random words in under a minute i know
[00:08:03] some people who can do it in about 30
[00:08:05] seconds
[00:08:06] so a random sequence of objects means
[00:08:09] that these are all nouns right a shoe uh
[00:08:13] an apple a balloon right these are all
[00:08:16] very easy to imagine so that actually
[00:08:18] makes memorizing words uh easier i don't
[00:08:21] know maybe they were all on a table as
[00:08:23] well i think i've seen that set up
[00:08:24] somewhere too but still that's fine you
[00:08:28] just have to memorize some kind of word
[00:08:31] for what you're seeing and then put it
[00:08:32] in a memory palace and it could be super
[00:08:34] fast now recently
[00:08:35] [Music]
[00:08:37] oh god i said i wouldn't talk about him
[00:08:38] again but mr bj uh shahi claimed to have
[00:08:43] done a guinness record bj after his
[00:08:46] whole controversy with me and his whole
[00:08:48] faked death thing
[00:08:50] he came out with this post where he said
[00:08:52] he had
[00:08:53] attempted
[00:08:54] i don't know his wording was kind of
[00:08:56] open to suggestion but it sounded like
[00:08:58] he broke guinness record in his
[00:09:00] announcement he said he
[00:09:02] made a record attempt
[00:09:04] memorizing random objects there was a
[00:09:06] picture of him at a table with some
[00:09:08] shampoo bottles some this some that okay
[00:09:11] so it looked like he was doing some
[00:09:12] version of this attempt either one right
[00:09:14] i didn't see 470 items so maybe it was
[00:09:18] the one minute one who verified this
[00:09:20] right and you know the actual attempt
[00:09:22] obviously at some point he has to submit
[00:09:24] that and then the governing body um the
[00:09:26] guinness
[00:09:27] governing body will verify all the
[00:09:29] things that had to be included in the
[00:09:32] submission
[00:09:33] if he failed to do any of that then he
[00:09:34] doesn't get the record so
[00:09:36] as of now and it's been a couple months
[00:09:38] uh he still does not have the record if
[00:09:40] you search the website it's still by
[00:09:42] nabal the current and real memory king
[00:09:45] of nepal so another message to bj out
[00:09:48] there please stop calling yourself the
[00:09:49] memory king because you are not the
[00:09:51] memory king you have proven nothing to
[00:09:54] be given that name all right all right
[00:09:57] let's move on
[00:10:00] all right this next one i love this guy
[00:10:02] okay so i don't know where he is anymore
[00:10:04] i think from what i've done in my
[00:10:06] research he was or still is a busker on
[00:10:10] pearl street mall in boulder colorado i
[00:10:12] was actually there pretty recently tried
[00:10:14] to find him not there so maybe he
[00:10:16] doesn't do it every day maybe he doesn't
[00:10:17] do it anymore but this guy is known as
[00:10:20] the zip code guy and the guinness record
[00:10:22] is the most consecutive zip codes
[00:10:24] identified
[00:10:26] by david raz dietscher and what did he
[00:10:29] memorize uh 36 total zip codes
[00:10:32] doesn't sound like a lot but it's
[00:10:34] consecutive and if you're not from the
[00:10:35] united states
[00:10:37] there are 50 states and each state has
[00:10:41] i don't it's complicated but there's
[00:10:43] lots and lots of different zip codes
[00:10:45] ranging from i think zero
[00:10:48] one something something something
[00:10:49] there's five numbers up to nine nine
[00:10:51] something something something now there
[00:10:53] isn't a specific zip code for every
[00:10:55] single five digit number but just about
[00:10:57] so david rosdicher has memorized over 40
[00:11:00] 000 zip codes in the us was able to
[00:11:02] correctly identify the addresses of 36
[00:11:05] consecutive zip codes randomly by us
[00:11:08] randomly selected by computer
[00:11:10] on guinness world records prime time los
[00:11:12] angeles march uh
[00:11:14] 12 2001.
[00:11:16] so
[00:11:17] yeah so i think the way his shtick works
[00:11:19] is you say a zip code like 33133 that's
[00:11:22] mine and then he goes oh that's coconut
[00:11:24] grove
[00:11:25] florida right or miami florida and he
[00:11:28] was able to do that 36 times in a row
[00:11:30] super cool uh it's hard to find footage
[00:11:32] of this guy at least super recently
[00:11:33] let's watch a quick clip of how he does
[00:11:35] this what is your zip code where you're
[00:11:37] from two nine six five four honea path
[00:11:41] south carolina
[00:11:43] 68 131 omaha nebraska zero seven zero
[00:11:47] nine zero westfield new jersey right
[00:11:51] super cool right i've always wanted to
[00:11:53] have this but it's obviously a lot of
[00:11:55] work to to practice for this but it'd be
[00:11:57] a super cool geographical memory feat to
[00:11:59] just be able to say what's your zip code
[00:12:02] oh you're from blah blah blah in terms
[00:12:04] of how it's done i mean if this is his
[00:12:06] one thing i'm sure he just spent a lot
[00:12:08] of time memorizing it i don't even know
[00:12:10] if he has a system it would probably
[00:12:12] make that a lot easier to convert the
[00:12:14] numbers into pictures and then just
[00:12:16] store all 40 000 bits of data takes a
[00:12:18] long time but it seems like he's been
[00:12:20] doing this for a long time so it's
[00:12:21] probably well ingrained in his mind by
[00:12:23] now very cool
[00:12:26] this record is called most rotating
[00:12:28] puzzle cube solved while blindfolded
[00:12:31] aka how many blindfold solves of a
[00:12:33] rubik's cube can you do so who graham
[00:12:36] sigens who is well known for doing multi
[00:12:38] blind solves 59 total
[00:12:41] rubik's cubes
[00:12:44] on november 10th 2019 so pretty recent
[00:12:46] so let's read what it's about the most
[00:12:47] rotating puzzle cube solved in one hour
[00:12:50] uh while blindfolded is 59 out of 60
[00:12:53] by graham siggins
[00:12:55] at the osu blind weekend event so that's
[00:12:58] a cubing event out in oregon he
[00:13:00] completed his attempt in 59 minutes and
[00:13:02] 46 seconds solving multiple cubes
[00:13:04] blindfolded is considered a mental
[00:13:06] accomplishment because the randomly
[00:13:07] mixed up state of every cube blah blah
[00:13:10] blah you're given an hour to memorize as
[00:13:12] many cubes as possible so it looked like
[00:13:13] he went for 60
[00:13:15] and made it within 59 minutes and 46
[00:13:18] seconds under the hour and then the goal
[00:13:21] with this blindfold is to take all 60 of
[00:13:24] those to solve them let's have a look at
[00:13:26] what this looks like
[00:13:34] [Music]
[00:13:51] totally nuts right and i've done a
[00:13:52] couple videos on blindfold solving a
[00:13:55] single rubik's cube you can watch that
[00:13:57] here or here wherever to do this for
[00:13:59] multiple rubik's cube you know the
[00:14:02] actual amount of information you have to
[00:14:04] memorize for a single deck isn't that
[00:14:05] much it's just a short string of letters
[00:14:08] so to do it for 60 you know you just
[00:14:11] need a memory palace for a single cube
[00:14:13] you don't really need a memory pouch you
[00:14:14] can just
[00:14:15] remember it
[00:14:16] but for more you obviously need some way
[00:14:18] of storing all that information so i
[00:14:20] haven't talked to him specifically about
[00:14:22] this maybe i'll do that in a future
[00:14:23] video but he's definitely using some
[00:14:25] large
[00:14:26] memory pals to store that actually he
[00:14:28] did send me a message when i made my
[00:14:31] super mario video memory palace thing
[00:14:33] he's saying he uses a super mario
[00:14:36] 64 memory palace as well so that's cool
[00:14:41] now this is the last one we're gonna do
[00:14:43] today i might do more in another video
[00:14:45] but there are a lot of records so this
[00:14:47] one is very interesting this is actually
[00:14:49] the record that i will be attempting i
[00:14:52] love the idea of this record because it
[00:14:54] encompasses both mental and physical
[00:14:56] aspects how many can you memorize that's
[00:14:58] the mental side obviously and then you
[00:15:00] got to hold your breath right and the
[00:15:01] longer you can hold your breath the more
[00:15:03] you can memorize and it gets painful to
[00:15:05] hold your breath after a while so how
[00:15:06] can you keep your mind composed while
[00:15:08] you're trying to do some really
[00:15:09] difficult memory tasks what i wanted to
[00:15:11] share here is the actual record that
[00:15:13] i'll be trying to beat by sanchez sharma
[00:15:15] who is an indian great competitor i
[00:15:18] haven't met him but i've competed
[00:15:20] against him virtually the record is 67
[00:15:22] cards so he did a deck of cards plus
[00:15:25] 15 cards so you needed two decks to do
[00:15:27] this and here you see them doing
[00:15:30] some kind of random shuffling
[00:15:32] you need to have judges who will
[00:15:33] randomly shuffle this beforehand and you
[00:15:35] get two separate decks they're not
[00:15:36] shuffled together that's important and
[00:15:39] he'll go underwater with one deck
[00:15:40] memorize it
[00:15:42] and if he needs the other deck they'll
[00:15:43] pass it to him
[00:15:44] he just can't surface
[00:15:46] until he's done with his attempt
[00:15:48] whatever that may be then afterwards on
[00:15:51] dry land out of the water he'll take a
[00:15:54] fresh deck or two decks and put them in
[00:15:56] the order of the cards that he memorized
[00:15:59] [Music]
[00:16:07] now you see him holding on to the
[00:16:10] the ladder here it's important for the
[00:16:12] record that you're completely submerged
[00:16:14] so just putting your head underwater um
[00:16:16] isn't enough let's fast forward here
[00:16:20] it's not clear from the video since it's
[00:16:21] cut a lot like how much time he actually
[00:16:24] spent underwater i wish you could see
[00:16:26] the actual timer
[00:16:28] but here he is after
[00:16:30] oh it says 222. okay
[00:16:35] now i know sanchit is very fast at cards
[00:16:37] so
[00:16:38] you know he probably did quite a number
[00:16:40] of reviews um in two minutes 20. it's
[00:16:43] not a crazy long breath hold
[00:16:46] so he went more on his ability to
[00:16:49] memorize fast i think i will
[00:16:51] be
[00:16:52] doing it more on how long i can hold my
[00:16:54] breath just because i'm not as fast as
[00:16:57] him with cards so here you go you can
[00:16:58] see him putting the deck of cards
[00:17:00] together he has this fresh deck in front
[00:17:02] of him and order ace king and he's got
[00:17:05] to pull them all into the order that he
[00:17:06] memorized that's a super cool record i
[00:17:08] think
[00:17:09] [Music]
[00:17:10] so let's talk about the event all right
[00:17:12] so when will i be doing this i'll be
[00:17:13] doing it on november 13th it's a
[00:17:16] saturday coming up
[00:17:17] at 3 30 the event will start i will be
[00:17:20] streaming it on my youtube channel live
[00:17:22] so you can watch it here if you're in
[00:17:24] the miami area you can definitely check
[00:17:26] it out it's going to be held at the
[00:17:27] university of miami pool deck i'll be in
[00:17:30] some corner over there
[00:17:32] while other people are probably
[00:17:33] practicing their diving and swimming
[00:17:35] laps
[00:17:36] um but i'll be there and the event will
[00:17:38] be sponsored by mind lab pro look at
[00:17:40] these guys
[00:17:41] oh i love these guys i've talked about
[00:17:43] them in my last video and a few other
[00:17:45] videos they're a nootropic blend that i
[00:17:47] take every day and i reap the benefits
[00:17:49] from mentally
[00:17:51] helps me stay sharp and it's helping me
[00:17:53] train for this the way the record will
[00:17:54] work is i'll be attempting a certain
[00:17:57] amount of cards trying to beat 67 cards
[00:18:00] okay i'm not going to tell you what i'm
[00:18:01] going to try to beat i'll just show you
[00:18:02] when i do the attempt and
[00:18:05] i'll go underwater
[00:18:06] memorize the cards as long as i can you
[00:18:09] know a lot of people ask me how long are
[00:18:10] you going to take and it's like well
[00:18:12] as long as i can do it before i
[00:18:15] die
[00:18:16] right
[00:18:17] i can only hold my breath for so long
[00:18:18] and then when i get out i'll put those
[00:18:20] decks or deck in order
[00:18:23] and uh we'll compare and
[00:18:25] the goal is to beat 67 cards now why am
[00:18:28] i doing this right well a couple things
[00:18:29] the mental and physical personal
[00:18:31] challenge i love trying to break a
[00:18:33] record especially a guinness record i've
[00:18:36] never tried a real guinness record i
[00:18:38] don't have one it's kind of one of the
[00:18:40] things on my checklist in this memory
[00:18:42] world of what i'd like to do i have the
[00:18:44] grand master title i have my usa memory
[00:18:46] championship i've competed in and gotten
[00:18:49] top 10 at a world championship guinness
[00:18:51] record would be nice but on top of that
[00:18:53] kind of bigger than everything november
[00:18:55] is national alzheimer's awareness month
[00:18:58] and
[00:18:59] as many of you know i started this
[00:19:01] journey into the world of memory because
[00:19:02] of my grandmother she had alzheimer's
[00:19:05] and if she hadn't struggled i would have
[00:19:07] never
[00:19:08] come down this road you know and anytime
[00:19:10] i can raise awareness for the disease
[00:19:12] especially during a month where it's the
[00:19:14] topic of the month

[00:19:18] an impact try to get some media around
[00:19:20] this have you guys watch this and
[00:19:22] realize what it's for and hopefully
[00:19:25] bring some attention to the disease
[00:19:26] which is still
[00:19:28] one of the top 10
[00:19:30] killers at least in the united states
[00:19:32] and it's the only one that does not have
[00:19:34] a cure or preventative measure so please

=== What Is A Nootropic? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCdNNz5g14E

[00:00:00] For a while, a lot of people 
would come up to me and be like,
[00:00:03] "Hey Nelson, what kind of
Nootropics do you take?"
[00:00:05] And I'd be like, "Um...
[00:00:08] ... uhh"
[00:00:09] And they'd be like, "Do you
know what a nootropic is?"
[00:00:12] And then I'd be like,
[00:00:13] "Yeah, of course.."
[00:00:15] ... when I really didn't.
[00:00:16] And I feel like that's pretty common
these days that
[00:00:19] people talk about nootropics but 
they don't really know what they are.
[00:00:21] Or the term is kind of thrown around
and used really lightly
[00:00:24] for a lot of things when
it shouldn't be.
[00:00:26] So in this video, we are 
gonna clear the air,
[00:00:28] and I'm gonna explain to you
what a nootropic is-
[00:00:30] in case you don't know.
[00:00:31] What they are good for
and what I think they are good for.
[00:00:34] Some of my favorite ones
[00:00:35] And... then we are gonna wrap up 
this video with a cool little announcement.
[00:00:39] So make sure to stay 
till the end. Because
[00:00:41] I'm really excited for this..
[00:00:42] Let's get started.
[00:00:49] Alright, so let's start with 
the basic question -
[00:00:51] What the hell is a nootropic?
[00:00:54] It's a fancy name.
But what does it actually mean?
[00:00:56] Here is my definition.
[00:00:57] A nootropic is any compound
or supplement
[00:01:00] that can improve cognitive performance.
[00:01:02] And I have to be careful here.
Because there are things out there
[00:01:05] substances, that can improve your
cognitive performance
[00:01:08] but they are stimulants 
and some of these
[00:01:10] actually have long-term, really bad
effects for your brain.
[00:01:14] So, what I am looking for
in a nootropic or blend of nootropics
[00:01:18] is something that is- that I call
stim-free
[00:01:20] and that is good for you.
Or there's some research around it
[00:01:23] that suggests that it's 
good for your brain.
[00:01:25] Now, you have to be careful
here as well because there's actually
[00:01:28] very little if any
[00:01:30] validated research that
backs up a lot of
[00:01:34] things that people say
are nootropics
[00:01:36] that actually enhances your memory
or cognitive performance.
[00:01:40] What you'll see in a lot 
of the research
[00:01:41] behind some of the nootropics 
is. it'll say,
[00:01:44] "MAY improve cognitive function."
[00:01:47] "May"
[00:01:48] Not "does" or "has been proven to"
-may
[00:01:51] And if- it says that it's usually backed up
by some research,
[00:01:55] - often times, the research 
isn't published yet
[00:01:57] or it isn't peer reviewed yet.
[00:01:59] But some claim to be
in the process of being
[00:02:02] published or have that true 
scientific endorsement.
[00:02:05] Now, that doesn't mean
that they don't work.
[00:02:07] That obviously means 
that you have to be careful
[00:02:09] and know what you are 
putting into your body.
[00:02:11] I've done a lot of research.
[00:02:12] It's kind of my business
and super important for what I do.
[00:02:16] So I've done a lot of research
[00:02:17] and I know what works for me.
[00:02:18] So I don't wanna put
anything into your heads.
[00:02:20] I have some suggestions.
[00:02:21] But I really encourage anyone
out there, who's going to
[00:02:25] delve into any of 
the nootropics that I'm gonna suggest
[00:02:28] or any that I have mentioned ever,
[00:02:30] to do your own research as well.
[00:02:32] Again, I'm not a nutritionist,
I'm not a scientist. I'm-
[00:02:34] Well... I am a master of science.
[00:02:37] I actually have that degree..
But
[00:02:39] that's computer science.
I'm not a nutritionist or a doctor.
[00:02:43] So take what I say with
a grain of salt.
[00:02:45] This is YouTube afterall.
[00:02:46] Right?
This is a free video..
[00:02:48] So.. I'm just trying to
share some of the knowledge
[00:02:51] that I know.
[00:02:51] Don't take it as gospel.
[00:02:53] But, it's not like I'm here
to deceive you. I'm telling you
[00:02:55] honest opinions
and what I know.
[00:02:57] So, what are some of 
the top ones that I use?
[00:03:00] .. Or that I really stand behind?
[00:03:01] Right, and this is the one
that I've talked about
[00:03:03]  in many of my videos and I 
still stand by it today.
[00:03:06] And I still take it everyday.
[00:03:08] Which is Omega-3.
[00:03:09] Specifically DHA.
[00:03:11] It's a fatty acid 
found in the brain
[00:03:13] that has been linked with
multiple brain health benefits.
[00:03:16] Sharper thinking, faster reaction times
and improved memory.
[00:03:20] There are studies 
that have shown this.
[00:03:21] Now, there are other kinds 
of Omega-3s.
[00:03:23] There's DHA, EPA and ALA.
[00:03:25] From what I understand, the other
two eventually convert into DHA.
[00:03:29] So you can find the other two.
But
[00:03:31] I find like, if you are gonna go
direct to the stores, why not take the DHA?
[00:03:35] You will find a lot of foods
that are fortified in DHA
[00:03:38] There's milk, juices, eggs.
[00:03:41] What I use is
some kind of supplement.
[00:03:43] S-Some kind of pill that's got 
a certain amount of milligrams of DHA
[00:03:48] And that's my daily take.
[00:03:50] Now, most commonly, 
a lot of people out there take fish oil.
[00:03:52] Right?
[00:03:53] ... Which has the DHA in it.
[00:03:55] You can often find DHA in
fatty fish like salmon.
[00:03:59] But I don't eat a ton of fish.
[00:04:01] So, it's a lot easier for me
to get the amounts that I need.
[00:04:05] Just for you know, DHA stands for
Docosahexanoic acid.
[00:04:08] Try saying that 10 times.
[00:04:09] Now, after DHA omega-3, 
the next compound that I stand behind
[00:04:13] and really believe in is this
Phosphatidylserine.
[00:04:15] Ooh, I said that right!
[00:04:17] Phosphatidylserine
[00:04:18] Phosphatidylserine...
What a fun word to say.
[00:04:21] Pho-pha-ti-dyl-serine!
[00:04:23] You try it.
[00:04:24] Phosphatidylserine.
[00:04:25] Docosahexanoic acid.
[00:04:27] Phosphatidylserine!
[00:04:28] Anyways, it is a fat compound
found in the brain
[00:04:33] and studies have shown that
supplementing can improve
[00:04:36] thinking skills, memory and also
reduces age-related decline.
[00:04:40] Now, in lot of these I'm saying,
"Studies have shown or suggests.."
[00:04:43] So I'll link to a lot of 
those studies in the description
[00:04:45] so you could check them out 
for yourself.
[00:04:47] If you wanna take them
for what they are, fine.
[00:04:50] If you don't wanna believe them, fine.
[00:04:51] It's always good
to be sceptical.
[00:04:53] My name even Nelson?
[00:04:54] Am I even a memory champion?
[00:04:56] Do I even know what 
I am talking about?
[00:04:57] You can never know.
[00:04:58] So Phosphatidylserine
is a fatty substance,
[00:05:01] like I said- it's
[00:05:02] It's actually called a phospholipid
[00:05:04] and it covers and protects 
the cells in your brain.
[00:05:06] So that they can better
carry messages between them.
[00:05:08] There's even studies
that animals have shown that
[00:05:10] levels of this stuff
decrease with age.
[00:05:13] So it's something that
keeps us young and sharp in the mind.
[00:05:16] Well, at least in animals..
But you know what I am saying.
[00:05:19] Next, after that, let's
talk about Vitamin B.
[00:05:22] Specially Vitamin B6, B9 and B12.
[00:05:25] Those three are often
linked with brain health.
[00:05:28] They can help break down
homocysteine
[00:05:30] high levels of which have been
associated with the greater risk
[00:05:32] of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
[00:05:34] B vitamins also help 
produce energy that are
[00:05:37] needed to create new brain cells.
[00:05:39] Cool.
[00:05:39] So B6 is also known as Pyridoxine.
[00:05:42] B9 is foliate/folic acid.
[00:05:44] And B12 is cyanobalamin.
[00:05:47] That's another fun one to say.
[00:05:48] Now, those are all stim-free.
[00:05:50] .. As I like to say.
[00:05:51] And just to give you 
an idea of some things
[00:05:53] that are not stim-free,
[00:05:55] think of caffeine.
[00:05:57] -Yeah, gives you a mental boost
but it is a stimulant.
[00:05:59] Then you have things like
Modafinil
[00:06:02] Ritalin, Adderall--definitely
improve your mental performance
[00:06:06] but with some serious drawbacks.
[00:06:08] And long term effects.
[00:06:09] These are stimulants.
These aren't things that you should be
[00:06:12] relying on for the long term.
[00:06:14] I mean, Adderall contains amphetamines..
But again,
[00:06:17] anything that can
improve your brain performance
[00:06:20] is considered a nootropic
[00:06:21] granted it's not always
a good one or a safe one.
[00:06:24] Now, this is where, it kind of
annoys me, is that
[00:06:27] you know, you have this word nootropic.
[00:06:29] And people are like, "What nootropic
do you take?"
[00:06:31] Or they kind of interchange it
with the smart drug.
[00:06:34] But these things are a lot
more naturally-occurring.
[00:06:37] Y-know, Unless we are talking 
about medaphine or adderall or whatever.
[00:06:40] But a lot of stim-free ones
I was saying.. And there's plenty others
[00:06:43] are naturally occurring.
They come from plants or something like that.
[00:06:47] They aren't a smart drug.
[00:06:49] They are a substance or compound
that help improve-
[00:06:52] or supposedly help improve
[00:06:54] cognitive performance.
[00:06:55] Okay, so that's the first misconception.
[00:06:57] It's not necessarily
referring to a smart pill.
[00:07:00] Now, there are companies out there
[00:07:02] that create nootropic blends
[00:07:04] which are proprietary formulas
[00:07:07] that combine
a lot of these different
[00:07:10] nootropics into
one single supplement pill.
[00:07:13] Just like you take a health supplement 
that has all your vitamins
[00:07:17] you know.. that in you need
to take and your fish oil or whatever,
[00:07:20] this is a nootropic blend.
[00:07:21] It's specific to
boosting your cognitive performance.
[00:07:25] So when you are out there
looking for a nootropic blend,
[00:07:28] make sure to see
what the ingredients are.
[00:07:30] And do your research on 
which ones
[00:07:33] are bunch of horse-crap,
[00:07:34] which ones are actually backed
with research,
[00:07:37] and to what extent?
[00:07:38] Is it a lot of research?
Is it well funded?
[00:07:41] Is it peer reviewed?
Is it-
[00:07:42] published anywhere?
[00:07:43] You know, you gotta do your
research to really understand
[00:07:46] what is good versus what is
kind of like snake oil.
[00:07:49] So, in the end- Should you 
be taking a nootropic?
[00:07:52] And... my answer to you
[00:07:54] in complete honesty
is.. "save your money"
[00:07:58] The easier thing to do and the safer thing
and the proven thing to do
[00:08:02] is to focus on your exercise,
[00:08:04] your sleep, healthy diet
and reducing or managing stress.
[00:08:08] Those four things have been
proven to actually
[00:08:11] boost your cognitive performance.
[00:08:13] And they are good 
for your entire body.
[00:08:16] But, if you are in the business of..
You know,
[00:08:18] really trying to push 
the envelope- which I am,
[00:08:20] I'm sure there are other careers
or businesses out there that require
[00:08:24] just that edge, that mental edge
[00:08:26] that maybe you can't quite get
through normal means.. So
[00:08:30] um, for me it makes sense to
[00:08:32] try some of these.. specially if 
I'm very careful in what I choose.
[00:08:36] What ingredients I put 
into my body
[00:08:38] then for me - I know it's a difference.
[00:08:40] And it helps me.
[00:08:41] And I also do take care of
those other four important-free
[00:08:45] nootropics, let's call them.
[00:08:47] So I feel like experimenting
on top of that.
[00:08:49] Little bit here, little bit there
is a safer way to go about it.
[00:08:52] Now, if you are curious about
which nootropic blend I take,
[00:08:56] I take this mindlab pro which I've 
talked about in a number of videos
[00:08:59] We are working together for 
the next year or so.
[00:09:02] And I really stand behind the product.
I've been using it
[00:09:04] for quite a while now and I really
enjoy what it's been doing for my
[00:09:08] cognitive performance.
[00:09:09] I have few championships
coming up to compete in
[00:09:12] and I really feel like I have that
little bit of an edge
[00:09:15] um.. to kind of help me
perform better.
[00:09:17] You can learn more about them.
I'll leave a link in the description
[00:09:20] and you an check them out
for yourself.
[00:09:21] Do a bit of research 
in their ingredients as well.
[00:09:24] I encourage you to do that.
[00:09:25] And you'll find that
their ingredients are actually very
[00:09:28] natural, safe and well backed 
by the research.
[00:09:34] Alright. Now with that 
out of the way, let's talk about
[00:09:37] the announcement.
[00:09:38] And that announcement is..
[00:09:40] next month, during National Alzheimer's
awareness month,
[00:09:44] I will be attempting
a Guinness book of world record.
[00:09:49] Now, I'm so excited- I've always
wanted to try to break a...
[00:09:53] Guinness world record.
[00:09:54] That's kind of the one thing 
that's missing from my memory titles..
[00:09:57] is a Guinness record.
[00:09:59] How cool would that be? So prestigious,
I would love to be
[00:10:03] blessed with that honour.
[00:10:04] So.. I found a record that
I wanted to beat.
[00:10:07] It's kind of an interesting..
mental plus physical challenge.
[00:10:11] And it's something I know
I can do.
[00:10:14] ... and can train for.
[00:10:15] And I have been 
training for it.
[00:10:17] That will be 
happening next month.
[00:10:18] I will share more about the 
specifics of the actual record and..
[00:10:22] how it goes down
and all that stuff
[00:10:24] in my next video.
[00:10:25] But the attempt will be
sponsored by mindlab pro.
[00:10:28] They are gonna be 
all over this thing.
[00:10:30] They are gonna film 
behind the scenes..
[00:10:32] Gonna do a whole exposé on
[00:10:33] how it goes down..
How I prepare for the record..
[00:10:36] How I hopefully, successfully
achieve the record,
[00:10:39] and then- I'll also be streaming it
[00:10:41] live on my YouTube channel.
So you can watch
[00:10:43] the day no matter where
you are in the world.
[00:10:46] Or even if you miss it,
you can re-watch it after.
[00:10:48] Wooh! I'm so 
excited to share this with you.
[00:10:50] So, please like share
and subscribe
[00:10:53] and even hit that
little notification bell
[00:10:55] so that you know
when I upload a new video
[00:10:57] and you'll definitely be able
to learn about the record
[00:10:59] that I'm going to be breaking
[00:11:01] very soon! So excited...
This is gonna be awesome.
[00:11:04] Anyways, hope you enjoyed this video.
[00:11:05] I'll see you in the next one.
I'm out.


=== My FAVORITE Memory Tools & Resources (and where to start) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cjYnXoghfE

[00:00:00] Hey guys,
what's going on?
[00:00:01] Casual chat at this 
nice little desk.
[00:00:04] We are gonna talk
about something
[00:00:06] that I've talked about
in a past video.
[00:00:08] But things have changed.
[00:00:09] In the modern day,
[00:00:10] what as a memory champion/
memory consultant/
[00:00:14] -dare I say it
[00:00:16] I can't believe I'm saying it..
[00:00:17] ... YouTuber?
[00:00:18] What are the tools, the software,
the hardware
[00:00:21] that I need to do my job
[00:00:24] to be a memory athlete,
to train my memory and my brain
[00:00:27] on a daily basis?
[00:00:28] So if you are getting started or
you are on the path that I am or..
[00:00:32] you are already here 
but you don't know where to go..
[00:00:34] I'm gonna share with you
some things that I
[00:00:36] live and die by 
that have really helped me
[00:00:38] accomplish the things that I'm trying to
accomplish in my business
[00:00:41] and my memory career.
[00:00:43] So let's dive right in.
[00:00:55] So starting with hardware -
Let's start with the basics.
[00:00:58] Decks of cards.
[00:00:59] I'm always gonna be using
a Bicycle set of cards. This is
[00:01:03] typically what is used 
in the USA memory championship.
[00:01:06] I mean, at any other championship
you can bring your own cards
[00:01:09] but to me, there's nothing like
a fresh pack of bicycle cards.
[00:01:12] They just are so smooth.
They feel good in my hands...
[00:01:15] They way the numbers and the suits 
are drawn is super familiar to me.
[00:01:18] I will buy packs of 12 decks 
of cards at Costco.
[00:01:22] It's the cheapest I've found.
[00:01:24] It's like 12 bucks, 
basically a dollar per pack.
[00:01:26] Those are the cards I use.
[00:01:27] Secondly, headphones...
[00:01:29] These are the exact same ones
I've shown in my last video.
[00:01:32] These are the exact same ones
I bought
[00:01:34] in my first championship
back in 2010.
[00:01:36] These are Peltor Optime 105.
[00:01:42] Yeah, they are just perfect
and at this point,
[00:01:44] they are more of a comfort thing.
They are my best friends.
[00:01:46] They go over my ears and I feel
like I'm slipping into a
[00:01:49] bath of warm milk.
[00:01:53] It's just cozy as hell.
[00:01:54] Next, my timer
is a speed stack timer.
[00:01:57] I have a dozen of them.
[00:01:58] Doesn't matter which one
as long as it shows a time going up.
[00:02:01] More in recent days, just because
I'm on the move a lot,
[00:02:03] I just use my iPhone.
[00:02:05] The actual timer on the iPhone is fine.
[00:02:07] There's also an app that is
a stack timer on the iPhone
[00:02:10] for iOS and Android as well,
I think.
[00:02:12] That's perfectly good.
[00:02:13] What's been really important to me
[00:02:14] as I age and I find myself
[00:02:17] sitting down a lot,
traveling a lot more now,
[00:02:20] uh, also spend time with my kids
sitting down.
[00:02:23] I need to stand up.
So this year
[00:02:24] I invested in a standing desk
[00:02:26] which I am sitting at right now.
[00:02:28] And I love it because
I can do my work.
[00:02:31] It's a perfect table 
to do all the training I need.
[00:02:35] I put my laptop on here.
Do my editing here..
[00:02:37] And then, when I want to 
stretch my legs,
[00:02:39] I just raise it all the way up.
[00:02:41] I'm a really tall guy.
I'm 6'6"
[00:02:43] And this is still
perfect for me.
[00:02:45] And I'm doing my work
standing up.
[00:02:48] I also like to do my 
memory training sitting down.
[00:02:51] Most of the time..
'cause that's like in competition.
[00:02:53] But also standing up.
[00:02:54] Because when I perform, when I'm
on stage, when I have to memorize things,
[00:02:57] I'm doing it standing up.
[00:02:59] And I know it sounds
so insignificant like,
[00:03:01] "Well, if you can memorize sitting down,
you can memorize standing up."
[00:03:04] Yes, but a lot of my speed 
and my comfort comes from
[00:03:07] where I train 
and how I train.
[00:03:09] So if I train in the setting
in which I'm going to perform,
[00:03:12] I do it a lot better.
[00:03:13] So, I've experimented with
a few different desks...
[00:03:16] I've had to return a few.
But this is the one that I settled on.
[00:03:18] And I love it.
[00:03:19] I loved it so much that I reached out 
to the people who made this one
[00:03:22] and said, "Hey, let me do a video
that includes your amazing desk
[00:03:26] that I freakin' love."
[00:03:27] So yes, this video is 
sponsored by Flexispot.
[00:03:29] They make this awesome table.
[00:03:31] I highly recommend it.
[00:03:32] Let's show you some of the features.
I first gotta show you
[00:03:34] how it goes up here.
[00:03:38] There we go. That's the max height.
[00:03:39] It's basically 48 inches.
[00:03:41] If I stand here...
Look at that! That's perfect.
[00:03:45] There we go.
A little bit higher.
[00:03:47] So apart from other
standing desks in the market,
[00:03:49] this product's design is built 
ergonomically special
[00:03:52] for each purpose and function.
[00:03:53] Also, the raw materials used
to make this desk
[00:03:56] are environmentally friendly.
[00:03:57] Not only that. I think for the quality
 of the desk you get,
[00:04:00] it's really hefty.
[00:04:01] It's got this nice little glass top.
[00:04:04] It's definitely super affordable
for what you are getting.
[00:04:07] Everything's smooth.
It's easy to put together.
[00:04:09] The desk goes up and down
like butter.
[00:04:11] It's really nice quality for
what you are getting and paying.
[00:04:15] Also, I have noticed,
one of the biggest gripes I've had with
[00:04:17] other standing desks 
that I have tried
[00:04:19] is that - yeah, it goes up, that's fine.
[00:04:21] But when it's standing, it's 
incredibly rickety.
[00:04:24] And the nice thing about this one is
[00:04:26] it's just as sturdy at the bottom
[00:04:28] of its lowest setting,
[00:04:29] as it is at its highest setting.
[00:04:31] Let's see that.
[00:04:32] Just to give you an idea, let's go
upto 48 inches here.
[00:04:37] I can lean on it. 
It's not gonna fall.
[00:04:39] It's sturdy. Doesn't really-
I mean yeah, of course
[00:04:41] this is a small table.
Anything's gonna shake a little bit.
[00:04:43] But I can lean on it.
I can lean all my weight on it.
[00:04:47] No big deal. Everything's sturdy.
I feel like its not gonna collapse.
[00:04:51] And we are good to go.
[00:04:54] You can do that 
all day long.
[00:04:55] The desk has a charger in it
[00:04:56] since it's plugged in of course.
[00:04:58] There's also some settings here.
So if you wanna register
[00:05:00] how high you like it for certain occasions,
you can program those in there.
[00:05:04] And just press the button.
[00:05:05] BOOM!
[00:05:07] Alright, let's talk about cameras
and my computer.
[00:05:10] Because that's an essential part 
to my business
[00:05:13] specially now that I film videos.
[00:05:15] I filmed a course...
All that stuff.
[00:05:16] And maybe of less importance
to you guys
[00:05:18] but just in case somebody cares
what I use I'm just gonna list them off.
[00:05:21] I've basically a 2019 MacBook Pro.
[00:05:24] What is it?
A 15 inch?
[00:05:26] I think I'm gonna
upgrade pretty soon.
[00:05:28] Just because it's struggling
to make these beautiful 4k videos for you.
[00:05:32] Speaking of that, on the other
side here, I have a camera
[00:05:34] that I use for all my videos now.
[00:05:36] It's a Canon R5.
[00:05:38] Love this thing.
But the files are huge.
[00:05:41] I don't like that.
But it looks crisp. It looks good.
[00:05:43] I feel like it makes me look good.
[00:05:45] What do you think?
Yeah?
[00:05:46] I do have some
other cinema cameras
[00:05:48] but those are just for my
[00:05:49] pleasure and sometimes if you see
something that looks
[00:05:52] ridiculous in quality,
I'm probably using one of those.
[00:05:55] Yeah, I got my light setup.
[00:05:56] I got a Rode mic
on top of the camera.
[00:05:58] I got a Rode lav mic here.
[00:06:01] I also have another desk mount
on my bedroom over there
[00:06:05] for my Podcast mic which is
the Shure SM7B.
[00:06:09] Everybody and their mother
has that microphone these days
[00:06:12] but it is really good.
[00:06:13] What about cubes? So, I do 
a little bit of cubing on the side.
[00:06:16] I wouldn't necessarily make a video
about what I use
[00:06:20] but my favorite 3×3 Rubik's cube
to use
[00:06:23] is the GAN 356 M
magnetic speed cube.
[00:06:28] This one specifically has
these awesome little magnetic dots
[00:06:31] that help it kinda click
into place
[00:06:33] when you have it flush
with the edges.
[00:06:36] Alright, next, let's talk about software.
[00:06:37] What kind of software do I use
to get my jobs done?
[00:06:40] Has the landscape changed 
since my last video?
[00:06:42] I mentioned the bunch
of things that I use..
[00:06:44] like memocamp..
I still use that.
[00:06:46] Memoriad...
[00:06:47] I use that less often because there
has not been a Memoriad
[00:06:51] championship since 2016.
[00:06:54] And the software's a bit clunky.
Still it's a bit outdated.
[00:06:58] I will pull it up from
time to time to train numbers
[00:07:00] but I don't much
use it anymore.
[00:07:02] The main two things I use
nowadays is Memory League
[00:07:04] which has grown tremendously.
[00:07:06] There are so many users on it.
[00:07:08] I love it.
[00:07:08] The features have...
become even better.
[00:07:11] And you just always find 
someone on there to train with
[00:07:14] and if you don't wanna train or
compete with someone,
[00:07:16] you can just train by yourself.
[00:07:18] I love it.
[00:07:18] Could it be better?
For sure.
[00:07:20] But it's a great social environment
to actually
[00:07:23] feel like you are part
of a memory community.
[00:07:25] Also, something that's new,
is there is this IAM training website
[00:07:28] and if you don't
know what that is,
[00:07:29] IAM stands for International
association of memory.
[00:07:32] They created a website, a digital
training website.
[00:07:35] Well, I wouldn't call it
a training website
[00:07:37] It's basically just a website
where you can practice
[00:07:39] the memory events that exists
[00:07:41] at the world memory championship
or other national championships.
[00:07:44] Excluding the U.S. championship.
That's always a bit different.
[00:07:46] But what's nice is, a lot of the 
championships these days
[00:07:49] are becoming more and more
digital.
[00:07:50] I love that!
[00:07:51] It means that the judges of the 
competitions don't have to spend hours
[00:07:55] scoring papers or 
anything like that.
[00:07:56] It's all immediate and 
it's all digital.
[00:07:58] So you can go to this website and...
[00:08:01] imagine that you are competing.
[00:08:02] You can do all the events
that they have
[00:08:04] in the same format.
[00:08:05] It's awesome!
[00:08:06] That was always one of my gripes that
it was really hard to find
[00:08:09] things that were exactly like
how it was gonna be in the championship.
[00:08:13] You know, you have to dig and find
[00:08:15] PDFs of old competition papers
[00:08:18] and even those, you knew 
you weren't gonna get something like that
[00:08:20] 'cause it's always randomized.
[00:08:22] But at least with this website
you are getting exactly how
[00:08:24] it is in the championship.
[00:08:25] I love that!
[00:08:25] Definitely check it out!
[00:08:26] Some other notables here..
[00:08:27] I use this website Numzi..
[00:08:29] I think the website's gone and now
it's only a payable app.
[00:08:32] I think it's like a dollar or something.
[00:08:34] On iOS and Android.
[00:08:35] This one and another website
which is still active called Major System
[00:08:39] helps you come up 
with a Major System.
[00:08:41] So if you are trying to 
figure out your number system
[00:08:43] and you are having a hard time
thinking of all the images
[00:08:46] for all the numbers,
[00:08:47] these two websites 
will help you come up with ideas.
[00:08:50] Super helpful.
Definitely check it out.
[00:08:52] Some of the other notables that
I've written down here..
[00:08:54] because I didn't memorize it..
[00:08:55] Uh, it's human benchmark..
I've done a couple of videos on that already
[00:08:58] They are fun.
[00:08:59] It's not like an official test but
the memory test there
[00:09:02] are a good way (I think)..
They are good memory games
[00:09:04] to actually practice them on
a daily basis and get better.
[00:09:07] Like I did in one of
my videos.. I created a system for it..
[00:09:10] I went balls out and 
actually beat the dang thing.
[00:09:12] And it was really good training.
[00:09:13] What else? Lumosity or any of
these other brain training apps,
[00:09:16] I'm not a huge fan.. I actually don't
have an account on any of them.
[00:09:19] But that's not true.. I have an account
on Lumosity but I've never used it.
[00:09:22] There was a time when I 
practiced a little bit with it.
[00:09:25] It was good but
nothing that I couldn't..
[00:09:27] do better on my own or
some of these other...
[00:09:30] uh.. resources that I've have
just told you.
[00:09:32] In terms of learning languages
which I am in the process of doing
[00:09:36] and which I have done 
in the past -
[00:09:37] Drops... I love Drops.
[00:09:39] You have heard me talk about Drops.
It's an easy app on your phone
[00:09:41] to just get your 
language learning fixed
[00:09:44] everyday just for a little bit of
dance to learn some vocabulary.
[00:09:47] Another good one is
actually practice talking
[00:09:49] with an online tutor abroad.
[00:09:51] italki and Preply.
[00:09:53] I used Preply a lot
when I was learning Dutch
[00:09:55] and I'm using italki now
[00:09:57] to learn this other language
which I'll tell you about later.
[00:10:00] In terms of review and apps
that helps you kind of
[00:10:03] get things into your long term memory,
review and study apps..
[00:10:06] Anki - I've told you
about that before.
[00:10:08] Chegg - I also use 
on my phone
[00:10:10] has a great app for my phone..
just quick flashcards.
[00:10:13] Also Memorize, I've talked 
about them before..
[00:10:15] Made by the amazing grandmaster
of memory Ed Cook.
[00:10:21] And then finally, "I do recall".
[00:10:23] That's a great website too.
[00:10:25] Alright, next let's 
talk about resources.
[00:10:27] So if you are new to
this memory world then you just wanna know
[00:10:30] where do I go..
where do I start?
[00:10:32] Here are a few places.
[00:10:33] And it depends.. right?
[00:10:34] Some people don't wanna spend
a dang cent on anything
[00:10:37] which is fine.
[00:10:38] Some people have a little bit
of a budget.
[00:10:40] Maybe wanna buy a book
or even a course.
[00:10:43] Some people just want
anything.
[00:10:45] They'll pay for one-on-one coaching.
[00:10:47] They'll pay for full-day seminar..
Whatever.
[00:10:49] So, let's start free.
[00:10:51] Right? What's free?
Well..
[00:10:52] my videos...
[00:10:53] Some other channels are really good
to find some
[00:10:55] memory content.
[00:10:57] Um, I gotta give my props to
Anthony Metivier.
[00:11:03] His magnetic memory method..
[00:11:09] His magnetic memory method YouTube 
channel/course
[00:11:13] has some of the greatest
content out there on the web.
[00:11:16] And he puts out a lot of content
and it's really thorough.
[00:11:19] Highly recommend checking
his stuff out.
[00:11:21] Also, good buddy of mine,
AE Mind/Luis Angel..
[00:11:24] Love his stuff too.
[00:11:25] Ron White, a former nemesis
of mine
[00:11:28] at the USA memory championship
has
[00:11:30] tons and tons of
videos on any
[00:11:32] memory related concepts
you could have even thought of.
[00:11:35] He's been around in the YouTube game
much longer than I have.
[00:11:37] So check out his channel as well.
[00:11:38] Another great resource 
that I tell everybody to go to
[00:11:41] who's just getting started..
[00:11:42] is the art of memory forum.
[00:11:44] Used to be called memo-techniques.
[00:11:46] It went under the umbrella name
of art of memory
[00:11:48] which was a software 
I've talked about before.
[00:11:50] I'm not really mentioning
them now because
[00:11:52] it didn't really amount to much
[00:11:53] even though there is the memory league
aspect of it which is great.
[00:11:56] And then this forum part of it
which is great too.
[00:11:59] People post on it.
[00:12:00] I've been posting on it for years.
[00:12:01] That's where I found a lot of 
the information when I was getting started.
[00:12:04] And there's just tons of information and
[00:12:06] it's a great way to get involved
socially with people who are
[00:12:09] like minded and interested 
in memory techniques.
[00:12:11] Also, Discord is more of a thing now.
[00:12:13] And one of my favorite channels
that I am a part of is Memory World.
[00:12:16] It's basically got a really 
enthusiastic community.
[00:12:19] They are always posting 
about ideas and...
[00:12:22] improvements and work 
that everybody is doing
[00:12:25] on their memory palaces 
and memory techniques.
[00:12:27] It's really cool to
kind of be a part of that.
[00:12:29] Now, once you are pass that,
maybe you wanna look at some books.
[00:12:32]  I should do a whole video to
what are my favourite memory books.
[00:12:36] But the main ones I would tell people
to start with are Moonwalking with Einstein
[00:12:39] bu Joshua Foer.
[00:12:41] That's a great kind of
very high level intro
[00:12:43] to the world of memory
and memory competitions.
[00:12:46] Next, after that, I might
shamelessly plug my own book.
[00:12:49] I have two - one for adults
and it's called "Remember it"
[00:12:52] and then I have another one 
for younger audience
[00:12:54] more cartoony, a little more childish,
[00:12:56] but not out of the realm of
adults' entertainment
[00:12:58] called memory superpowers.
[00:13:00] Either of those are pretty cheap.
You can find it on Amazon.. Super easy.
[00:13:03] If you want a great e-book,
I suggest "Unlimited Memory" by
[00:13:07] Kevin Horsely.
[00:13:08] It's one of the best
[00:13:09] e-books on Amazon.
[00:13:12] You'll see, it has thousands 
of positive reviews.
[00:13:14] It's really good stuff.
So check that one out.
[00:13:16] Also, anything by Dominic O'Brien.
[00:13:19] That's where I got 
my start in memory.
[00:13:21] You can't go wrong
with any of them in my opinion.
[00:13:23] And then, if you want 
just a broad book on
[00:13:25] learning how to learn,
I would recommend
[00:13:27] the book called "Learning
How To Learn"
[00:13:29] by Barbara Oakley.
[00:13:31]  Love her book.
[00:13:32] It's a great book for anyone
who's studying something right now.
[00:13:35] Whether its school or language
or a career task, whatever.
[00:13:39] Next, if we go 
an echelon above that, we're talking
[00:13:41] memory courses online.
A little more
[00:13:44] costly... little more of your scratch.
[00:13:46] If you gotta give up there,
I'll recommend my course, of course.
[00:13:50] Everest Memory Masterclass.
[00:13:52] You can sign up
with the link in the description.
[00:13:54] Another favorite course
of mine is..
[00:13:56] as I said before,
Anthony Metivier's
[00:13:58] Magnetic Memory Method course.
[00:14:01] It's really good.
Definitely recommend it.
[00:14:03] Another one you can check out
is Jonathan Levi's super learner academy.
[00:14:07] Awesome stuff there.
And then, finally
[00:14:09] I gotta give a plug
to Ron White.
[00:14:11] I don't honestly know
what his courses look like right now.
[00:14:14] But he has been in the game
for decades.
[00:14:17] And his product is quality.
[00:14:19] And I know a lot of people
who come to me who have taken his course
[00:14:22] and have said really good things.
So check out
[00:14:25] Ron White's website and see 
what he's offering at the moment.
[00:14:29] And then, one level above that
is private coaching.
[00:14:31] I do private coaching.
Feel free to reach out.
[00:14:34] You can go to the website
learnwithnelson
[00:14:35] to learn a little bit more
about what I offer.
[00:14:37] And to set-up a
free call to just
[00:14:39] chat with me and see what
your memory goals are
[00:14:41] and if it's a good fit 
to work together.
[00:14:42] Other people I wanna recommend reaching
out to if you wanna work with someone is
[00:14:46] Yanjaa Wintersoul
[00:14:47] who has competed with me
in numerous competitions.
[00:14:50] Also Ron White, I believe 
does some private training.
[00:14:53] John Graham is also another
USA memory champion.
[00:14:55] He does some coaching as well.
[00:14:57] Who else does coaching?
[00:14:58] And Johannes Mallow..
He's awesome too.
[00:15:01] Who else?
[00:15:03] I don't know.
[00:15:03] But if anyone's gonna bring
up the name Jim Kwik..
[00:15:06] Uhm.. Yeah.. I don't know
if he does private stuff..
[00:15:09] If he does, he's probably 
charging a lot
[00:15:11] because he works with
really high profile people.
[00:15:13] And if you are asking me
if his book is any good..
[00:15:14] Umm, I've gone through it
[00:15:16] It's.. You are not gonna
get memory techniques like
[00:15:19] some of the resources I've given 
you here to be honest.
[00:15:21] Um, his book is more about
just..
[00:15:23] kind of sharpening your mind I guess.
[00:15:26] In a broad sense.. not very specific.
[00:15:28] Not to bash the book.
But I just--
[00:15:30] It definitely has its place.
Definitely worth the read
[00:15:33] if you are into anything mental.
[00:15:35] But if we are looking for
actual tangible results
[00:15:39] in terms of how to use
your memory in day to day world,
[00:15:41] and improve on it,
[00:15:43] I don't think that book
is gonna cut it.
[00:15:45] Alright guys..
[00:15:46] Those are my recommendations.
What do you think?
[00:15:48] There are many resources there
that will help you out
[00:15:51] in whatever you are trying to
accomplish in this memory world.
[00:15:54] And I wish you the best
on your journey.
[00:15:56] That's it for this video.
[00:15:58] I'll see you in the next one. 
I am out.


=== Blindfolded Speed Cards Recall??? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw7GBFrTNgk

[00:00:00] how's it going guys
[00:00:01] today we're going to try something a
[00:00:03] little different and something that i
[00:00:04] don't think i've ever seen been done
[00:00:06] memorizing a deck of cards now
[00:00:09] of course people have memorized decks of
[00:00:11] cards before and really fast and a lot
[00:00:14] of them but has anyone ever memorized a
[00:00:16] deck of cards and then put it together
[00:00:20] blindfolded
[00:00:22] now what i mean by that is take a
[00:00:24] shuffle deck of cards memorize it but
[00:00:27] then
[00:00:28] without looking at the cards themselves
[00:00:31] take the cards blindfolded and place
[00:00:34] them in the order of a standard fresh
[00:00:36] new deck of cards meaning ace de king
[00:00:39] ace de king ace de king ace the king all
[00:00:41] four suits right so you're taking a
[00:00:43] jumbled deck of cards that you've
[00:00:45] memorized and placing it in the standard
[00:00:48] order the default factory order without
[00:00:51] looking i'm gonna be the first to try
[00:00:52] that today i don't know how long it's
[00:00:54] gonna take
[00:00:55] quite a while probably but this would be
[00:00:58] a fun challenge i think and i'd love for
[00:01:00] others to try it too who are into memory
[00:01:02] techniques and who can memorize a deck
[00:01:03] of cards what's the fastest we can get
[00:01:05] this to
[00:01:06] now what i'm going to be timing is
[00:01:09] the amount of time it takes to memorize
[00:01:10] the deck of cards that's important
[00:01:12] because yes i can do it very fast but
[00:01:14] the way i'm going to recall it doesn't
[00:01:16] lend itself to memorizing the deck very
[00:01:18] fast i'll have to make sure i know
[00:01:20] absolutely
[00:01:21] where every card is backwards and
[00:01:23] forwards perfectly so i'll have to go a
[00:01:25] little slower so that i can perform the
[00:01:27] recall the way i just described so we'll
[00:01:30] measure the time from when i start
[00:01:31] memorizing to when i think the deck is
[00:01:34] all completely back together again let's
[00:01:36] do it
[00:01:38] so just one quick thing i wanted to say
[00:01:40] before we start this part of the video
[00:01:42] is you know it's kind of long and for me
[00:01:45] it's interesting and for maybe someone
[00:01:46] who
[00:01:47] is into memory sports might think it's
[00:01:49] interesting but if you don't see that
[00:01:50] way then maybe as an alternative you
[00:01:52] could see this video as a study with me
[00:01:54] video so take the next 20 or so minutes
[00:01:57] which is about the time it takes for me
[00:01:59] to do this memory feat
[00:02:01] and i put some chill music i'm doing a
[00:02:03] memory task maybe you can get some
[00:02:04] memory training done as well during this
[00:02:07] 20 minutes and see what you come up with
[00:02:08] i will make this video a little more
[00:02:10] useful by making it a study with me
[00:02:12] session as well
[00:02:14] not only just the hey this is what i can
[00:02:16] do hope that helps a little bit now back
[00:02:18] to the memory feet
[00:02:24] so just your standard deck of cards i've
[00:02:26] used these a bunch to train over the
[00:02:28] last week so they're already jumbled but
[00:02:30] i'm going to shuffle it a bunch
[00:02:33] [Applause]
[00:02:46] the math behind this is that seven
[00:02:48] riffle shuffles it's mathematically
[00:02:51] sound
[00:02:53] to mix up any deck
[00:02:57] [Applause]
[00:02:58] pretty cool paper if you ever want to
[00:02:59] read it alright
[00:03:01] there it is
[00:03:06] [Music]
[00:03:07] now just to set things straight
[00:03:09] i'm going to memorize this and then the
[00:03:11] order in which i'm going to
[00:03:13] put the deck
[00:03:14] i'll do it ace to king ace the king ace
[00:03:17] the king ace the king okay and let's do
[00:03:19] it i don't know let's start with hearts
[00:03:22] uh spades diamonds clubs hearts spades
[00:03:25] diamond clubs all right just so that
[00:03:27] we're on the same playing field
[00:03:30] just so that we're on the same page here
[00:03:36] [Music]
[00:03:45] [Music]
[00:04:01] [Music]
[00:04:19] so
[00:04:25] [Music]
[00:04:35] [Music]
[00:04:40] do
[00:04:55] [Music]
[00:05:06] [Music]
[00:05:18] do
[00:05:21] [Music]
[00:05:35] [Music]
[00:05:55] so
[00:05:57] [Music]
[00:06:05] [Music]
[00:06:10] just go through to my mind
[00:06:15] [Music]
[00:06:27] do
[00:06:32] [Music]
[00:06:44] [Music]
[00:06:48] okay
[00:06:51] let's put on the blindfold and we'll
[00:06:53] start with
[00:06:54] the hearts
[00:06:56] [Music]
[00:07:04] okay
[00:07:06] so we're looking for ace of hearts
[00:07:08] that's the first card
[00:07:11] okay
[00:07:12] [Music]
[00:07:21] [Music]
[00:07:26] [Music]
[00:07:37] [Music]
[00:07:45] all right ace of hearts
[00:07:53] [Music]
[00:07:59] two hearts
[00:08:04] [Music]
[00:08:18] [Music]
[00:08:48] three of hearts
[00:09:02] four of hearts
[00:09:11] five of hearts
[00:09:22] six of hearts
[00:09:29] seven of hearts
[00:09:31] [Music]
[00:09:44] eight of hearts
[00:10:02] nine of hearts
[00:10:15] [Music]
[00:10:28] [Music]
[00:10:37] ten of hearts
[00:10:55] jack of hearts
[00:11:06] queen of hearts
[00:11:33] so
[00:11:54] which
[00:12:03] king of hearts
[00:12:06] alright so we have
[00:12:08] the hearts i'll put it over here
[00:12:12] okay now let's do the spades so we'll
[00:12:14] start with ace of spades
[00:12:24] [Music]
[00:12:34] ace of spades
[00:12:37] [Music]
[00:12:45] [Music]
[00:12:51] two of spades
[00:12:56] [Music]
[00:13:01] [Music]
[00:13:17] three of spades
[00:13:25] [Music]
[00:13:43] four of spades
[00:13:52] five of spades
[00:14:05] [Music]
[00:14:29] six of spades
[00:14:54] seven of spades
[00:15:02] eight of spades
[00:15:06] [Music]
[00:15:18] nine of spades
[00:15:45] [Music]
[00:15:47] ten of spades
[00:16:03] jack of
[00:16:06] spades um
[00:16:22] [Music]
[00:16:28] [Music]
[00:16:34] queen of spades
[00:16:58] king of spades
[00:17:06] jesus all right so these are the spades
[00:17:10] put that on top there's the hearts
[00:17:13] okay all right now we're gonna do
[00:17:16] the diamonds
[00:17:18] we're looking for ace of diamonds that's
[00:17:20] me
[00:17:23] this is a tough mental exercise because
[00:17:25] as the cards the deck gets smaller
[00:17:28] i gotta remember the ones i've already
[00:17:31] passed over and put in the other pile so
[00:17:34] the images are constantly changing
[00:17:44] [Music]
[00:17:51] so
[00:18:00] ace of diamonds
[00:18:20] so
[00:18:24] [Music]
[00:18:28] two diamonds
[00:18:46] three of diamonds
[00:18:48] [Music]
[00:18:55] [Music]
[00:19:01] four of diamonds
[00:19:04] [Music]
[00:19:17] [Music]
[00:19:22] five of diamonds
[00:19:24] [Music]
[00:19:40] so
[00:19:43] [Music]
[00:19:53] six of diamonds
[00:20:01] seven of diamonds
[00:20:10] [Music]
[00:20:14] eight of diamonds
[00:20:29] nine of diamonds
[00:20:38] [Music]
[00:20:45] ten of diamonds
[00:20:49] [Music]
[00:21:00] jack of diamonds
[00:21:03] [Music]
[00:21:14] queen of diamonds
[00:21:33] and king of diamonds
[00:21:40] okay
[00:21:45] all right so now we're doing the clubs
[00:21:47] this is the last one
[00:21:50] ace of clubs let's go
[00:21:54] [Music]
[00:22:00] so ace of clubs
[00:22:02] this is two of clubs
[00:22:05] [Music]
[00:22:08] three of clubs
[00:22:15] so
[00:22:25] [Music]
[00:22:31] four of clubs
[00:22:32] [Music]
[00:22:36] five of clubs first card
[00:22:40] six of club
[00:22:47] seven of clubs
[00:22:50] [Music]
[00:22:57] eight of clubs
[00:23:00] [Music]
[00:23:11] nine of clubs
[00:23:13] [Music]
[00:23:19] ten of clubs
[00:23:27] oh
[00:23:30] made a mistake
[00:23:32] so i said this was the ten of clubs
[00:23:35] [Music]
[00:23:38] and i said this was the nine of clubs
[00:23:41] but this actually
[00:23:43] this is the jack of clubs
[00:23:45] [Music]
[00:23:50] let me put that to the side if you'll
[00:23:52] allow me to correct myself
[00:23:54] so jack of clubs is here
[00:23:56] nine of clubs is actually this one
[00:24:01] okay ten of clubs
[00:24:03] we're back on track here i think
[00:24:05] this is the jack of clubs
[00:24:09] okay
[00:24:11] good save
[00:24:13] and then i believe this one
[00:24:16] queen of clubs and king of clubs
[00:24:23] i hope that's correct
[00:24:25] all right here we go
[00:24:34] ace two three can you see that ace two
[00:24:37] three four five six seven eight nine ten
[00:24:40] jack queen king that's the hearts ace of
[00:24:43] spades two three four five six seven
[00:24:46] eight nine ten jack queen king of the
[00:24:48] spades
[00:24:50] diamonds ace two three four five six
[00:24:52] seven eight nine ten jack queen king and
[00:24:56] then clubs ace two three four five six
[00:24:59] seven eight nine ten jack queen king
[00:25:02] nice look at that
[00:25:05] [Music]
[00:25:14] [Music]
[00:25:41] anyways what'd you think
[00:25:43] i personally think that's pretty cool
[00:25:45] i'm a bit biased of course but i think
[00:25:47] if you're into memory sports and you
[00:25:49] understand what it's like to memorize a
[00:25:51] deck of cards and to recall it you know
[00:25:53] how tricky that actually is and what i
[00:25:55] would love to see happen is some other
[00:25:57] memory athletes or other memory
[00:25:59] enthusiasts that are watching this try
[00:26:01] this see how long it takes you i want to
[00:26:04] make this a thing where people can get
[00:26:06] to do it really fast
[00:26:08] i did the whole thing in 20 minutes i
[00:26:10] definitely can improve on my score i
[00:26:12] could have memorized it faster i could
[00:26:14] have been a little more decisive
[00:26:16] going through the recall i was very safe
[00:26:18] just because i wanted to get it right
[00:26:19] but i'm sure there's definitely people
[00:26:21] out there that can do this faster if
[00:26:23] they tried it a couple times i think i
[00:26:25] could do it a little faster if i tried
[00:26:26] it again but uh what's the fastest do
[00:26:29] you think people could do this sub 10
[00:26:31] minutes some five minutes yeah that'd be
[00:26:33] nuts anyways i challenge you
[00:26:36] whoever you are to try this and uh tag
[00:26:39] me if you make a video about it i'd love
[00:26:41] to watch it and
[00:26:42] share it eventually in one of my
[00:26:44] reaction videos anyways that's it thanks
[00:26:46] for watching this i hope this was
[00:26:47] interesting or at least useful if you
[00:26:49] use it as time to study i'm out
[00:26:53] [Music]


=== Memory Champ DEFEATS Human Benchmark "CHIMP TEST" !!! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE7EY9cbcTI

[00:00:00] Guys, this is level 40.
[00:00:03] This is the end of the game.
[00:00:05] One strike to go,
[00:00:07] this is gonna be a world record.
[00:00:09] Um...
Where to start?
[00:00:13] Alright. So it was recently
brought to my attention that
[00:00:15] the grandmaster of chess,
Hikaru Nakamura,
[00:00:19] had an awesome run
on the Chimp Test
[00:00:22] of human benchmark.
[00:00:23] Now, instead of just reacting to it,
which I've watched it,
[00:00:26] it's awesome..
[00:00:42] Yeah...
That's unbelievable!
[00:00:44] I figured.. Listen,
last time I did it - I gave up.
[00:00:47] To be honest I'm just..
I quit.
[00:00:50] I was just bored.
I didn't wanna try anymore..
[00:00:54] I stopped at like 19
or something like that.
[00:00:56] But, I know I can get further.
[00:00:58] And I think I can tie or beat
[00:01:02] what Hikaru got.
[00:01:03] Not only that. Days later,
I saw a video by...
[00:01:07] one of my favourite speed-runners of
Mario 64, Cheese,
[00:01:11] just casually do the Chimp Test
on a stream and he got
[00:01:15] to like level 32
[00:01:16] and I think he just paused.
[00:01:17] I don't know how far he
went after that the next day.
[00:01:19] It was really impressive.
[00:01:21] That actually impressed
me more than Hikaru's.
[00:01:23] Anyway. I wanna see
how high I can get
[00:01:26] of a score on the Chimp Test
using my memory techniques
[00:01:30] if I really try.
[00:01:31] And I hope that I
can get that high.
[00:01:32] Otherwise, I'm
gonna feel very sad.
[00:01:34] And I'll cry myself to sleep.
[00:01:38] Just an FYI, this is gonna be
a long video
[00:01:40] because it's probably gonna
 take a long time
[00:01:42] but let's see how it goes.
[00:01:44] Let's get started.
[00:01:46] "Are you smarter than a chimpanzee?"
[00:01:48] Let's find out.
[00:01:49] "Click the squares in order
according to their numbers.
[00:01:52] The test will get progressively harder."
[00:01:54] Sounds good.
[00:01:55] Alright.
Let me start the timer here..
[00:01:57] And let's go.
[00:01:59] 1-2-3-4
[00:02:03] 1-2-3-4-5
[00:02:07] 1-2-3-4-5-6
[00:02:13] 1-2-3-4-5-6-7
[00:02:21] 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8
[00:02:27] 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9
[00:02:31] 7-8-9
[00:02:32] 7-8-9
[00:02:33] Or let me just remember 897.
[00:02:35] 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9
[00:02:45] Upto 10 in one minute.
Great.
[00:02:47] 1-2-3-4-5-6
[00:02:50] I like that. We go up this way
and then down this way.
[00:02:53] And then 7-8-9-10!
[00:02:58] 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10
[00:03:05] This video is not sponsored
by Hertz or American Airlines
[00:03:08] I've clearly been shopping
for some travel..
[00:03:10] Alright.
[00:03:11] 1-2-3.. 4-5-6.. 7-8-9..
and then 10-11
[00:03:19] 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11
[00:03:27] So nothing special up until now.
I'm just kind of...
[00:03:30] trying to remember the first cluster
that's easy
[00:03:33] and then kinda having
a repeated pattern in my mind
[00:03:36] for the rest--
A lot of people do this. Nothing special.
[00:03:39] The technique and ideas
that I have might apply better to
[00:03:42] potentially this round
or coming up soon at least.
[00:03:46] It depends on how difficult or
spaced out the clusters are..
[00:03:49] or how favourable they tend to be.
[00:03:51] But right now, this probably
isn't that impressive.
[00:03:55] I mean, it may not
get impressive. But let's see.
[00:03:57] 1-2-3-4-5.. 6-7-8-9-10
and then 11-12
[00:04:05] So 12 is on the bottom.
It's Rubik's cube, just resting there..
[00:04:09] 6-7-8-9-10
[00:04:14] 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12
[00:04:23] Alright.
[00:04:23] 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10
[00:04:29] So here, maybe I'll start
introducing some
[00:04:32] memory techniques.
[00:04:32] So, basically I'm just
using my memory palace
[00:04:34] and store some of the bigger numbers.
[00:04:36] Like I clearly through
this pattern, recognition stuff
[00:04:39] I can do up to about
10 comfortably.
[00:04:42] That much shshshh...
[00:04:43] strain maybe 8 to 10-11-12
[00:04:46] if it's placed well.
[00:04:47] But um higher above that,
I'm just gonna use memory palace
[00:04:50] to store the information.
[00:04:52] So I don't have to have
as much of a mental load
[00:04:54] Umm... so let's uhhh
[00:04:57] Okay, so we have 13!
[00:04:59] So that's ex-girlfriend playing tennis..
[00:05:02] Okay..
[00:05:03] I'll probably do up to 9.
Okay so then
[00:05:04] the next one would be 12...
[00:05:07] Uhh, me giving a speech okay.
[00:05:10] Alright, so now just
gonna remember up to 9
[00:05:11] 1-2-3-4-5
[00:05:14] So 1-2-3-4-5-6
[00:05:17] 7-8-9
[00:05:18] So triangle 7-8-9.
[00:05:21] Clockwise 7-8-9.
[00:05:22] 7-8-9
[00:05:28] Okay 1-2-3-4-5
[00:05:35] 6...
[00:05:38] 7..
[00:05:40] 8-9
[00:05:42] All right and then,
[00:05:44] uh I was giving a speech.
[00:05:47] Next word for playing tennis..
[00:05:50] 11-12-13 alright.
[00:05:52] Let's speed this part up
to get to the juicy stuff.
[00:05:55] Now, a couple things I wanna say
[00:05:57] at first part, you probably
were like wait what
[00:05:59] ..is he talking about
ex-girlfriend, tennis racket?
[00:06:02] What!
[00:06:04] What was that..?
[00:06:05] Suppose,
[00:06:06] I was very confused here.
[00:06:08] That's alright! That's a
shame but let's try it again, I guess.
[00:06:11] One strike, damn it.
[00:06:12] So the first thing,
I wanna say is that
[00:06:14] ..going forward as
the numbers get higher.
[00:06:16] I'm employing this technique
of using the memory palace
[00:06:18] but I wanna elaborate on
what I actually mean by that.
[00:06:21] And what the hell I'm actually doing,
[00:06:23] up to 20 and 21 minutes.
[00:06:25] That's not good sign!
So I would say...
[00:06:27] you know, to double that.
[00:06:28] It's gonna be double the time
but no, it just get exponentially harder.
[00:06:31] So... all right!
[00:06:34] Trying to get to 30 right.
That's kind of a good goal..
[00:06:36] Anything past that is icing on the cake.
[00:06:39] By the way, if you wanna
watch the entire video
[00:06:41] uninterrupted uncut..
[00:06:43] Three and a half hours of me,
memorising these patterns, this Chimp test
[00:06:47] then, by all means do so..
[00:06:48] the link will be above or
in the description below.
[00:06:51] Yeah, have fun with that...
[00:06:53] 1-2-3-4-5
[00:06:57] -6
[00:07:00] -7-8 grab the 9-10
[00:07:03] alright!
[00:07:03] So then here, we had uh
hockey player playing tennis
[00:07:08] uh with some glasses, that's later.
[00:07:10] So 14 and 20
[00:07:11] Then this was...
[00:07:13] Uhh...
[00:07:17] 18-13
[00:07:20] 15 and 12.
[00:07:25] -13
[00:07:31] 13
[00:07:32] uhh 14..
[00:07:39] 14
[00:07:41] 15
[00:07:43] Okay, 16-17
[00:07:50] -18
[00:07:55] 19-20 alright.
[00:07:57] Now back to the explanation.
[00:07:58] First of all,
I've a number system!
[00:08:00] So, when I say I'm
gonna just do maybe up to 10
[00:08:05] or so, just from the visual memory
that's everything you've seen so far.
[00:08:08] Me, just kind of learning
where the places are, all the numbers
[00:08:11] and looking for little patterns,
nothing special.
[00:08:13] But when I'm using a
memory palace..
[00:08:15] I'm basically looking
at the bigger numbers
[00:08:17] in some of these early cases that's...
[00:08:20] the numbers 11-12-13-14
and then eventually up to 40.
[00:08:24] And I've a system, where
[00:08:26] every two-digit number
actually translates to a person
[00:08:29] an action and an object.
[00:08:31] It's complicated sort of,
not really..
[00:08:33] I've other videos on it
you can check them out up here
[00:08:36] or in the description.
[00:08:37] Just a little note on that,
you don't actually have to have a person
[00:08:40] action object system.
[00:08:41] You can just have any way
to represent a two-digit number
[00:08:45] and there are many ways to do that.
[00:08:46] Again, I'll put links and
resources in the description
[00:08:49] so, you can develop that
if you choose to do it.
[00:08:51] But if at any point in this video,
[00:08:53] you think it to yourself, Holy shit!
This is pretty crazy
[00:08:56] or mind-blending or..
[00:08:58] How the hell did this
guy get up to level 30, whatever
[00:09:01] 40 whatever.
[00:09:02] I'm serious when I say this,
but anybody can learn to do this.
[00:09:05] You see, I take my time
[00:09:06] it's not something that super quick,
like some other people can do
[00:09:09] on this test.
[00:09:09] But you can learn how to
do this and beat this test too.
[00:09:14] 2-3-4
[00:09:17] So, what basically my plan was..
[00:09:19] was for the numbers that
I couldn't place visually right!
[00:09:23] So up to about 10 or 11
depending on the cluster an shape of
[00:09:26] some of these different arrangements.
[00:09:29] I would go row by row
[00:09:30] I would basically, convert each of the
numbers into a person doing an action
[00:09:34] with a thing and sometimes
with another person.
[00:09:36] It depends on, how
many there were in a row.
[00:09:38] But either way,
I put one.. collection
[00:09:41] in all location
typically one per row.
[00:09:44] And I was very flexible
sometimes I only had one number.
[00:09:47] I'll just picture one person
[00:09:48] in a location in my
memory palace for that line.
[00:09:51] If there were two numbers
I'd do person with an action..
[00:09:54] If there were three,
I'd do person action object
[00:09:56] and if there were four even...
[00:09:58] I'd do person action objects
with another object or another person
[00:10:03] sometimes I'll have to stretch it.
[00:10:04] And then if there was
another number I had to encode..
[00:10:08] you'll see at the very end
that's kind of what I have to do.
[00:10:10] I might do multiple locations just..
because I have to.
[00:10:14] But the idea is that,
when I go to recall it
[00:10:17] after I done my little visual thing
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10.
[00:10:21] You know, I just knew that by heart!
[00:10:23] Then I can just remember,
[00:10:24] what I had on each row
using my memory palace
[00:10:26] and I don't even have to
think of any visual pattern at all.
[00:10:30] I just go into my memory palace
and remember who was where..
[00:10:34] corresponding to what row,
and just pick them out
[00:10:36] as I need them.
[00:10:37] It is a little mentally exhausting,
not gonna lie..
[00:10:40] when the numbers get bigger and
there's more numbers on the board.
[00:10:42] But let's watch a few more,
[00:10:44] so that you can get an idea of some
of the crazy stuff, that I see in my mind.
[00:10:48] 29 here, let's get to that 30
and then I will be happy.
[00:10:52] Guarantee, anybody
who's done this did not have
[00:10:54] kids screaming downstairs so...
[00:10:56] 1-2-3-4-5
[00:10:58] Then all to the other side 6
[00:11:00] -7-8-9...10
[00:11:04] Ohhh.. I don't like this!
[00:11:07] Alright, I'm gonna be ultra-
conservative on this one
[00:11:10] just because I wanna see that 30.
[00:11:12] Um basically, let's see
I'm gonna go 1-2...
[00:11:17] 1-2-3
[00:11:19] -4-5-6..
[00:11:22] and then 7.
[00:11:25] You know what, No I will go to 9..
[00:11:28] You know what,
[00:11:30] I will go to 10 because..
[00:11:31] -7 once I get here, I know that
8 is gonna be bottom one.
[00:11:35] 8 is the vagina...
So, it's always down there right?
[00:11:38] On the bottom right?
[00:11:39] And then I'll come back,
so 7-8 and then
[00:11:42] back to where, I just was
and then tennis directly below it so...
[00:11:46] Let's go up to 10.
[00:11:48] Alright! So let's memorise this....
[00:11:51] Uh okay, so now...
[00:11:55] Okay, so we have..
[00:11:58] Britney Spears is running
a chalk board, a basketball
[00:12:01] just drawing a basketball
and then screaming at it.
[00:12:04] Okay, Britney Spears drawing on a
chalk board, basketball screaming at it.
[00:12:07] Then we have,
[00:12:09] Um, Andre Agassi
is doing a BG dance..
[00:12:13] BG's dance!
Uh holding a plane.
[00:12:15] Andre Agassi, he's
in his short jeanshorts
[00:12:19] from the 80's long hair and he's doing
BG's dance with a plane.
[00:12:23] Alright!
[00:12:24] Umm then we have,
Arnold Schwarzenegger
[00:12:29] putting glasses on his "D..."
[00:12:34] Okay!
[00:12:35] So Arnold Schwarzenegger's
putting glasses on hid "D..."
[00:12:38] in this little closet, for whatever reason.
[00:12:41] Then I've me,
[00:12:43] I'm angry at a shopping bag,
just cheering at the threads...
[00:12:47] Okay!
[00:12:48] Then we have Monique Kayaking,
[00:12:49] and she's crying on a hockey stick.
[00:12:51] So Monique is Kayaking
[00:12:53] and crying on a hockey stick
at the same time.
[00:12:55] And then we have Brian,
being crucified.
[00:12:58] 1-2-3-4-5
[00:13:09] -6
[00:13:20] we have -7
[00:13:23] -8-9-10.
[00:13:26] Alright!
[00:13:29] God, why is that the hardest part..
[00:13:31] Look at this!
I know all those numbers.
[00:13:32] I know, what all of them are..
[00:13:34] This is the first part, that like I
really don't have a technique for...
[00:13:37] I should, I could encode them but
it's like a waste because..
[00:13:41] I don't know!
[00:13:42] I guess it's not a waste, maybe
I should start doing that just to be safe.
[00:13:52] 28-29
[00:13:56] Kill me!
[00:13:57] We keep going,
should we keep going?
[00:14:00] Yeah, why the F not..
[00:14:02] Alright, let's take a look here.
[00:14:04] 1... -2-3-4
[00:14:09] -5-6-7-8
[00:14:12] Yikes, I do not like that one.
[00:14:16] 1-2-3
[00:14:18] then 4-5-6-7
[00:14:20] 4-5-6-7
I'm literally gonna just stop.
[00:14:24] Maybe at the 8..
Okay, let's just go to 8
[00:14:27] Nelson shut the fu** up!
[00:14:28] Alright so, let's keep this
let's get memorisation under control
[00:14:31] although you can memorise
these simple 8 ones.
[00:14:33] And will be good.
[00:14:35] Alright so...
[00:14:36] Uh, next place is
okay by the door here.
[00:14:39] Tony Blair is putting
a wig on his D***.
[00:14:43] Tony Blair is putting
a wig on his D***...
[00:14:45] And then sun-glasses on..
[00:14:47] Wig on his D*** and then glasses okay.
[00:14:50] Then we have summer
storm being crucified..
[00:14:54] by a basketball
[00:14:57] and a barbell.
[00:14:59] Summer storm being
crucified by a basketball first
[00:15:03] and then she gets
dropped on a barbell on her...
[00:15:07] ...basketball and a barbell.
[00:15:09] Alright, and then Arno uh
Macaulay Culkin is shaking his ass..
[00:15:14] on uh a snake,
wearing pants alright.
[00:15:20] ...wearing pants on a kennel there.
[00:15:22] Then we have Andre Agassi,
shopping for Rubik's cube.
[00:15:27] He's looking for a ripe right?
Good one..
[00:15:29] to put in his bag alright!
[00:15:30] And then we have um...
[00:15:33] Olivia Newton uh is flying..
[00:15:37] So Olivia Newton is flying on a plane
around the grass there.
[00:15:40] And then we have Albert Einstein
playing hockey with some poop.
[00:15:45] Make sense because it's
out by where the dogs go poop.
[00:15:47] Albert Einstein is playing
hockey with some poop
[00:15:50] slap shouting it into a tree.
[00:15:52] And then we have my sister
Kayaking in the parking lot.
[00:15:55] Nice...
[00:15:56] 1-2-3-4
[00:16:01] 5-6-7...8
[00:16:06] Yes!
[00:16:10] Let me review what these are..
[00:16:12] just so I know, I'm pretty
sure that this one's the 9...
[00:16:15] could be this one.
[00:16:16] I'll get to it uh
when I review it here.
[00:16:19] So the first one was uh..
Tony Blair putting a wig
[00:16:23] on his crotch with glasses so...
[00:16:26] this is 10-30
[00:16:28] 29 and then 20.
[00:16:31] The next one,
the next row is..
[00:16:36] 22-23-24 and then 16.
[00:16:40] Okay!
[00:16:40] And the next one was..
18-13-26-27
[00:16:45] And then it was 11,
[00:16:47] uhh...12
[00:16:49] Now 11-25-12 and then 9-17
[00:16:53] and then 15-14
[00:16:55] uh... 21 and then 28-19
[00:16:59] Okay!
[00:17:08] 26-27...28
[00:17:15] ...29-30
[00:17:17] Hell yeah baby!
[00:17:18] Made it to level 3,
I think this is beating the Grand Master
[00:17:22] of Chess guy right?
[00:17:23] But I remember Cheese,
I believe he got to 32!
[00:17:26] So we gonna do one more
and maybe one more after that..
[00:17:29] And then let's see,
maybe I'll just stop for a little bit.
[00:17:32] This is a beautiful board
of so many numbers.
[00:17:34] Alright, so honestly at this
point every subsequent level is taking
[00:17:38] more and more time,
for me so...
[00:17:40] I think the best use of our time
and your time as a viewer
[00:17:44] is uh let's kind of fast
forward through the next..
[00:17:48] 10 or so.
[00:17:49] And then I'll show you the
very last one, where I beat the game
[00:17:52] which is the 40th level.
[00:17:54] Again, if you wanna watch any of these
and their full entirety and
[00:17:57] see what I'm saying!
How I'm thinking whatever.
[00:18:00] The link will be in the description.
[00:18:01] Let's get to it...
[00:18:23] Guys...
[00:18:24] This is the level 40th!
[00:18:27] This is the end of the game.
[00:18:29] One strike to go and
this is gonna be a world record.
[00:18:32] Now, I know other
people who have done 40,
[00:18:34] there's no where
you can go after that
[00:18:36] I don't know how long it took them but
you've the prove that I've done
[00:18:40] every single one..
[00:18:42] in 3 hours total.
[00:18:44] Yes, it took some breaks
I've done all in one day.
[00:18:46] I don't know for other people
if they stepped away
[00:18:49] because you can keep
your computer open.
[00:18:51] But, I spent all day
three hours of my day
[00:18:54] doing this because I wanted
to do this as a Memory Champ.
[00:18:58] I feel like I should
be able to do this so...
[00:19:00] Let's do this.
[00:19:02] Wow! Look at that...
beautiful completed board.
[00:19:05] Yeah!
[00:19:06] 1-2-3-4
[00:19:11] ...5
[00:19:15] I think, I'm gonna
have to memorise a lot here.
[00:19:17] There's no like empty,
not that it really matters..
[00:19:19] 1-2-3
[00:19:22] Alright like that
1-2 and then 3-4-5
[00:19:24] It's all kind of like on those two rows,
[00:19:26] 1-2...
[00:19:27] 3-4-5 and then 6
[00:19:30] You know what,
I'm just gonna go up to 7.
[00:19:32] Just keep a light, just want rely
on my memory to bring this home.
[00:19:36] Okay!
[00:19:37] I think, we need a new
memory palace at this point
[00:19:39] because I've run out of space.
[00:19:41] What can I use here, okay!
[00:19:43] I've got another one.
[00:19:45] Alright, so..

boost your mood.
[00:00:58] Now, the problem with
boosting your mood is that
[00:01:00] implies that your mood is lower
than it should be.
[00:01:02] So you don't feel great,
you don't feel really motivated
[00:01:05] So a lot of the time you don't even
wanna do the things that,
[00:01:07] say I'm suggesting to you.
[00:01:09] But what helps me is
knowing that doing
[00:01:12] anyone of these things
I'm about to tell you
[00:01:15] will actually make me
feel better.
[00:01:16] And when I feel slightly better,
[00:01:19] I then maybe wanna do
another one.
[00:01:20] And that makes my mood
boost even more.
[00:01:23] And so on and so on, it can
cascade into something where
[00:01:26] you finally feel happy,
[00:01:28] can get out of bed,
[00:01:29] can smile, can go
about your day and
[00:01:31]  feel like it's a good day.
[00:01:36] Now, one second here..
[00:01:37] Let me just get in close here.
[00:01:40] Now, a lot of you guys
are new to this channel.
[00:01:43] I've had a crazy boost of
subscribers in the last month.
[00:01:46] So I just wanted to
say thank you.
[00:01:47] For those of you
who are just stopping by,
[00:01:49] why not consider subscribing?
[00:01:50] That would be a
huge help for me and
[00:01:52] the algorithm that makes people
watch more of my videos.
[00:01:58] Now, befroe we dive
into the actual tips,
[00:02:00] maybe let's spend a little time
talking about
[00:02:02] what the word happiness means.
[00:02:07] This is a basil plant.
[00:02:08] So the word happiness actually
comes from a word
[00:02:11] that is kinda derived
[00:02:12] from the meaning of luck
[00:02:13] or random chant
[00:02:14] as in haphazard or happenstance.
[00:02:17] So a lot of people back in the day
used to think that
[00:02:19] happiness was derived
from luck
[00:02:21] or divine fortune.
[00:02:24] Not divine power.
[00:02:25] On the flip side though,
[00:02:26] there's a lot of people who
also believe that happiness is
[00:02:29] basically derived from equation.
[00:02:31] Mix a certain level of dopamine
[00:02:33] plus a correct stimulation
of a certain part of the brain
[00:02:36] and blam, voila!
You are happy.
[00:02:38] But to be honest, the answer's
[00:02:40] probably somewhere
right in the middle.
[00:02:43] Now, there are two
types of happiness, really.
[00:02:47] And I kind of eluded
to this in my last video
[00:02:49] where I talked about
this happiness test.
[00:02:51] If you haven't seen it,
please check it out.
[00:02:52] I think it's a fun little test
that will help you figure out
[00:02:55] what's kinda missing in your life
to make you happier.
[00:02:57] But anyways, I talk about
how there's kind of the short term
[00:03:00] ... gratification and there's
the long term fulfillment.
[00:03:03] Now, both can lead to happiness
[00:03:05] but they are kind of
different types of happiness.
[00:03:07] The first one which is the
short term gratification is called
[00:03:10] hedonic...
I think I said that right.
[00:03:12] And that's basically
maximum pleasure minimum pain.
[00:03:15] Usually that kind of momentary stuff
[00:03:17] superficial..
[00:03:18] But it does make you happy.
[00:03:20] Right?
[00:03:20] Think of like, binge watching
your favorite show..
[00:03:23] Playing a new video game
mindlessly.
[00:03:26] Eating your favorite meal.
[00:03:27] Eating snacks and sugary stuff.
[00:03:29] Doing that stuff does
make you happy in the moment.
[00:03:32] Right?
[00:03:33] But it's fleeting.
[00:03:33] Once it's all done, over,
you don't quite
[00:03:36] have that happiness last.
[00:03:38] The other type is
long term fulfilment
[00:03:40] is called eudaimonic.
[00:03:43] And that's usually tied to
[00:03:45] living your life in-line
with your goals.
[00:03:48] Having.. You know, what I was
saying before, sticking to things.
[00:03:51] Having the things that make you happy
[00:03:52] but for the long term.
[00:03:53] Not a bunch of these
immediate gratification stuff.
[00:03:56] And these kinds of
[00:03:58] activities or things
that lead to this type of happiness
[00:04:01] to deal with more challenging things,
[00:04:02] things that aren't quite
[00:04:04] enjoyable at the time
but afterwards
[00:04:06] feel like they were
more this type to fun.
[00:04:08] So both of these will
actually make you happy
[00:04:11] and put a smile on your face
but
[00:04:13] they kinda lead to two types
of fulfilment.
[00:04:15] I recognize that genetics play
a large part in happiness.
[00:04:19] And actually it breaks down
into - about 50%
[00:04:22] of happiness is genetic.
[00:04:24] (can't do much there)
[00:04:25] 10% is about your
life circumstance, environment.
[00:04:30] Stuff that is harder to change
[00:04:32] and for most people
[00:04:33] very difficult if not
impossible to change.
[00:04:36] And then the 40% left over,
[00:04:38] is changeable.
[00:04:40] Which is great.
[00:04:41] Because even if you are able to
change that 1 or 2%,
[00:04:44] for the positive,
[00:04:45] that could make the difference
between a good day and a bad day.
[00:04:48] Could be the difference
between doing well
[00:04:50] and doing great. Or feeling bad
or feeling okay.
[00:04:53] So with that out of the way,
let's talk about these tips
[00:04:56] and how you can start improving
or bumping up that mood
[00:05:00] to make you feel happier.
[00:05:07] Alright, for our first tip,
[00:05:09] this one absolutely sucks.
[00:05:10] It's just so hard to do
[00:05:13] but it honestly
[00:05:14] makes such a huge difference.
[00:05:16] It's such a modern day problem
but it's so
[00:05:19] closely attached to
day to day happiness
[00:05:22] and that is...
do a digital detox.
[00:05:25] Yeah, you hear it everywhere.
[00:05:26] And it's really hard to do.
[00:05:27] Trust me, I have tried,
[00:05:28] I've done it for little stretches
but it is tough.
[00:05:31] But one thing I can say is,
once you are in the thick of it
[00:05:33] once you've given it
a few days,
[00:05:35] you've really stuck to it,
[00:05:36] it really becomes
the easiest thing in the world.
[00:05:38] You could really feel
weight-lift of your shoulder.
[00:05:40] It's an amazing feeling
and you're just like
[00:05:42] "Wow! I don't ever need
social media again."
[00:05:46] You know, you'll probably
eventually go back to it.
[00:05:48] But I think being more
mindful of
[00:05:50] how much time you spend
on your digital devices
[00:05:52] plays a huge factor in your happiness.
[00:05:54] The less, the better.
[00:05:55] I think, we are in the most
difficult things to deal with
[00:05:58] on digital platforms or social media
or whatever.
[00:06:00] It is this thing that we do..
[00:06:02] We compare ourselves to others.
[00:06:04] It's really hard not to do it
[00:06:05] because we see people
doing amazing stuff.
[00:06:07] That's all they post,
positive things, right?
[00:06:09] People rarely post shitty things
in their lives.
[00:06:12] So we just compare
ourselves to others and we
[00:06:14] feel bad when we are not doing that
or at least
[00:06:17] trying to do something
close to that.
[00:06:19] It's a mess.
[00:06:19] And so if you can
remove that from your life,
[00:06:22] and not even have any idea
of what people are doing,
[00:06:25] you just worry
about yourself.
[00:06:26] And you are happy and content
[00:06:27] with what's going
on in your own life right now.
[00:06:32] Which leads me
to the next tip.
[00:06:34] Be present.
[00:06:35] Be where your feet are.
[00:06:36] I've done videos on this before
[00:06:38] and I talk about it
a lot.
[00:06:39] That also makes your life
more memorable
[00:06:41] but it also makes you happier.
[00:06:43] When you can really focus on
what is presently happening,
[00:06:47] to you at this moment,
[00:06:48] you can be happier with
the result of that.
[00:06:55] Get out in nature.
[00:06:57] Go outside.
Get exposed to that natural light.
[00:07:01] Studies show that being outside
in an outside setting,
[00:07:03] actually better complete and
offer faster recovery from stress.
[00:07:07] So get outside.
[00:07:17] This next two tips are kind of
[00:07:19] together.
[00:07:20] And the first one is
[00:07:21] - I love this one...
[00:07:22] I've been doing it
for the last year and it really
[00:07:25] has helped me just
feel more fulfilled in my life.
[00:07:28] And that is to reflect
[00:07:30] on your day at the end of the day
[00:07:32] and specifically, an actionable item
you can do is
[00:07:35] in journal or some kind of
Google Doc or something,
[00:07:38] is.. take one memory
from your day
[00:07:41] and... remember it,
write it down.
[00:07:44] And think about it.
[00:07:45] Takes just a few minutes
a day.
[00:07:47] But really sitting there and
thinking about your day
[00:07:50] and trying to find that one
special memorable moment
[00:07:53] is awesome.
[00:07:54] And it's really rewarding
over time.
[00:07:56] And on top of that,
[00:07:57] it actually makes your
days more memorable.
[00:07:59] Now, if you are saying, I don't have
anything interesting
[00:08:01] happening to me everyday.
[00:08:02] What could I possibly think
about, 'that special moment'?
[00:08:05] Trust me.
There is always something.
[00:08:07] And it doesn't have to
be huge.
[00:08:08] It can be tiny..
It could be..
[00:08:10] chipotle burrito bowl
that you had for lunch.
[00:08:12] If that's really just what
made your day special.
[00:08:14] That's fine..
Or it could be, you know..
[00:08:16] a look that your  little 3-year-old
gave you
[00:08:18] when you cracked a joke
and he smiled at you.
[00:08:20] Or it could be something huge..
Like you went skydiving.
[00:08:23] Or you did zip lining
or something like that.
[00:08:26] Tied to that is...
This is the next tip..
[00:08:28] is... to be more grateful.
[00:08:30] Practice gratitude.
[00:08:32] And an actionable item
for that is to
[00:08:34] maybe when you are reflecting
on your day is to
[00:08:36] find a few things.
[00:08:37] One, two or three things that
you are grateful for.
[00:08:40] Now, a lot of people
out there are talking about,
[00:08:42] you know, have a gratitude journal
and write it down everyday..
[00:08:46] And that's great.
I'm up for that if you could stick to it.
[00:08:48] But I don't think yo have
to go that far...
[00:08:50] As long as you carve out some time
at the end of your day,
[00:08:53] 5 minutes,
[00:08:54] to reflect on that one thing
[00:08:55] that was special to you each day
[00:08:58] and something you are grateful for.
[00:09:00] Right? Could be the same thing
you are talking about everyday.
[00:09:02] I'm grateful for my family,
I'm grateful for my job..
[00:09:05] Whatever.
[00:09:06] The one we reflect on our day
and we feel
[00:09:09] gratitude towards something.
[00:09:10] Many researches has been
done on this and they show that
[00:09:12] it makes us feel happier.
[00:09:21] Now this one works really well and
I don't really know why, but
[00:09:24] it's something I do everyday
and that is
[00:09:28] do my memory training
[00:09:29] first thing in the morning.
[00:09:31] Like it's the first thing
I cross off my list.
[00:09:34] But there's something that
really just triggers me to feeling better
[00:09:38] about my day going froward
when I know
[00:09:40] .. well, when I do these
mental exercises
[00:09:43] my brain feels sharper,
[00:09:44] it feels better, feels like
it's in a better mood.
[00:09:47] And I've also done stuff
that I'm working on
[00:09:50] that long term fulfilment stuff..
[00:09:52] I don't know if it's something
to do with the memory training itself.
[00:09:55] But it definitely
boosts my mood when I do it.
[00:09:57] So... People watching this channel,
you've seen a lot of my tips
[00:10:01] You are probably doing
some of these stuff.
[00:10:03] But do it first thing
in the morning.
[00:10:04] Not all of it.
But at least get some of it done.
[00:10:06] Or work on it a little bit
[00:10:08] and tell me what you think.
[00:10:09] And kind of in line with this
also is
[00:10:11] getting my physical training,
my exercise,
[00:10:14] out of the way early
in the morning too.
[00:10:15] That's just a personal preference.
[00:10:17] I like to get it done because
then I feel like I've done so much
[00:10:19] before my kids are even awake.
[00:10:21] Or before I even
have breakfast, right?
[00:10:23] Do my mental training,
my physical training.
[00:10:25] I got the whole day
ahead of me.
[00:10:26] How productive, right?
[00:10:27] That feels good.
At least for me.
[00:10:34] All right, this one's weird but it...
[00:10:37] really does make me feel better.
[00:10:38] And that is knitting!
[00:10:40] Who knits out there?? Who of my followers
knit, leave a comment
[00:10:42] in the description below. 
But I've knitted...
[00:10:45] I have knit
[00:10:46] I have knitted
[00:10:47] I have knat??
[00:10:48] I have knit!
[00:10:49] I have knit for...
[00:10:51] since, I think I learned
how to knit one in 2005
[00:10:54] or something like that.
[00:10:55] And yes, I get some strange looks
[00:10:57] when I'm knitting on an airplane,
[00:10:58] or knitting outdoors or knitting
on a mountain.
[00:11:00] I've done that..
There's just something about
[00:11:02] the calmness it brings..
[00:11:03] The kind of satisfaction you get,
[00:11:05] from completing a project
[00:11:07] or completing some work.
[00:11:08] And, the knots
[00:11:09] and the counting of rows 
and stuff like that, for some reason
[00:11:13] it just really
makes me feel happy.
[00:11:15] May be that's just
 a general thing with
[00:11:17] things that are intricate,
[00:11:18] that you're using your
hands and your mind.
[00:11:20] But.. I mean knitting is that thing.
[00:11:22] Tell me something else
that's kind of like that??
[00:11:27] Crossing shit off lists.
[00:11:30] Holly hell!
[00:11:31] This stuff just makes me feel so good.
[00:11:35] Even if it's the most
mindless task like...
[00:11:38] Wake up my kids
[00:11:40] and I cross it off.
[00:11:41] There is something about that action
that makes me feel accomplished
[00:11:44] and therefore productive
[00:11:45] and therefore happy.
[00:11:47] Stuff like to do my memory training,
[00:11:49] go for workout, get this call done.
[00:11:51] Send this email, all those kind of things
once I cross it off that
[00:11:54] feeling of crossing something off,
[00:11:56] whether it's digitally or by hand
[00:11:58] on a list is AWESOME...
[00:12:01] So, make a list
[00:12:02] and start crossing shit off!
[00:12:04] You're welcome.
[00:12:13] Can we give a sleep
[00:12:14] a bit of love here?
[00:12:16] Without the proper amount of sleep,
[00:12:18] your mind is gonna be just
absolute garbage.
[00:12:21] Uhhh, the recommended time
[00:12:22] or amount of hours to sleep
[00:12:24] we all know this number, but
do we abide by it?
[00:12:26] Probably not, that number is 7 hours!
[00:12:28] Now there's even studies that show that
[00:12:30] if you're getting
[00:12:32] under 6..
[00:12:33] or over 8..
[00:12:35] You already gonna
have some issues too.
[00:12:37] So even over sleeping
[00:12:38] has been shown to be associated with
[00:12:40] increased mortality rates.
[00:12:42] So, get the right amount of sleep.
[00:12:44] Now it's tough 
to get to bed on time
[00:12:45] There's sometimes a feeling that
you got to get this done.
[00:12:48] You wanna stay out longer whatever...
[00:12:50] But if you go into it thinking,
[00:12:51] I'm gonna get more sleep
[00:12:52] because it's going to help my mood
[00:12:54] and by improving my mood.
 I'll be able to get a lot more done
[00:12:57] then maybe it's worth more than you think.
[00:12:59] Right??
[00:12:59] Yes, you can get more done 
if you sleep less
[00:13:01] but you're also gonna feel shittier.
[00:13:03] So why not sleep more
[00:13:05] feel better about yourself.
[00:13:06] So that you feel
like you can do more!
[00:13:08] When you are in that 
positive mood right?
[00:13:11] Yeah..
[00:13:20] Alright let's talk about Supplements.
[00:13:22] There are certain supplements,
[00:13:23] that I take that help
[00:13:25] improve my diet but also help improve
[00:13:27] my mental performance.
[00:13:28] And.. mood!
[00:13:30] So for the last year or so, 
I've been experimenting with nootropics.
[00:13:33] And, I have
[00:13:34] really come to love them
and there's one in particular that
[00:13:37] I have been taking I've actually partnered
with them because I like them so much.
[00:13:40] That brand is Mind Lap Pro.
[00:13:41] You might have seen me
talk about them on other videos.
[00:13:43] One of its added benefits
[00:13:44] is that it boosts your mood
[00:13:46] and reduce stress.
[00:13:47] Since before I was taking it
[00:13:49] to now that I take it...
[00:13:50] I generally feel better
when I am taking this.
[00:13:53] And I have actually even tried stopping it
[00:13:56] for certain amount of time and then
[00:13:57] reintroducing it into my diet.
[00:13:59] And I notice a difference,
[00:14:00] I really do!
[00:14:01] We'll talk more about it at
the end of this video.
[00:14:03] Now I am not saying that
is the one supplement
[00:14:05] you need to take,
[00:14:06] but there are supplements
[00:14:07] out there of certain foods
[00:14:08] that might work for you
[00:14:09] that actually help boost your mood.
[00:14:15] Alright the next one,
this one's tough too...
[00:14:17] Especially if you are not so good
with your food and what you eat.
[00:14:20] But basically eliminate
Sugar or reduce it.
[00:14:23] Anything that cases
inflammation in the body.
[00:14:26] I find when I do my strict diets
from time to time.
[00:14:29] I'll do keto diet watching my macros.
[00:14:31] One of the things that
gets pretty much
[00:14:33] completely cut out is
[00:14:34] processed foods and refined sugars.
[00:14:36] So all that food if 
I eliminated or limit it.
[00:14:39] I just feel better, I feel happier
[00:14:41] Yes at first I kind
of crave those things
[00:14:44] and that doesn't make me happy.
[00:14:46] But here we are taking about kind of
the longer term
[00:14:49] and I do feel,
[00:14:50] this heavier sense of happiness
[00:14:53] when I don't have those
kinds of toxins in my body.
[00:14:55] Once you have been doing it
[00:14:56] for a couple weeks,
you really will know
[00:14:59] what I am taking about.
[00:14:59] So try it do a sugar detox,
[00:15:01] you will find that
you will notice that
[00:15:03] your mood is
more consistently up..
[00:15:09] Buy experiences
[00:15:11] not things!
[00:15:12] Do I really need to say more?
[00:15:13] I mean a thing feels
good when you buy it.
[00:15:15] Actually, honestly for me
[00:15:17] looking up and wanting a thing
[00:15:19] and then the purchase of it
[00:15:21] is really what gets me excited and then
usually once I have it
[00:15:24] the excitement for it goes down
[00:15:25] pretty quick for most things
[00:15:27] not everything but most things.
[00:15:28] While an experience
[00:15:29] I mean yes you enjoy it while
you are doing it.
[00:15:31] But often experiences
[00:15:32] feel good for a long time after
you have that memory
[00:15:36] that story,
[00:15:37] that thing you accomplished.
[00:15:38] Those tend to last longer
[00:15:40] plus you can share experiences
[00:15:41] with other people
which also adds to its value.
[00:15:46] Uff..
[00:15:46] All right guys that's it.
[00:15:48] Do you feel happier?
[00:15:49] Well, may be not may be
[00:15:51] seeing my face doesn't make you happy.
[00:15:53] But hopefully some
of those tips are helpful
[00:15:55] and I really encourage you to try them.
[00:15:56] Some of them are so simple
[00:15:58] like go out side or
[00:16:00] sit by a window.
[00:16:01] But they actually make
[00:16:02] incremental changes to your mood
[00:16:04] and in a day and a age where
[00:16:05] mental health is of the
[00:16:07] utmost importance.
[00:16:08] I believe that we need to
work on this.
[00:16:10] It's not something necessarily that
[00:16:12] will always come to you
[00:16:13] and it's encouraging to know
[00:16:14] that there are ways to slightly boost it.
[00:16:17] Now if you want to boost my happiness
[00:16:18] please give this
video a little like!
[00:16:20] No, I shouldn't be
preaching that giving me likes
[00:16:22] is actually a very superficial
[00:16:24] kind of happiness.
[00:16:25] I get more happiness
[00:16:26] sharing this content
[00:16:27] for free with you guys
and hoping it makes
[00:16:30] someone's life out there better.
[00:16:32] Now one of the tips.
[00:16:33] I did talked about was
[00:16:34] this brain supplement
that I take and
[00:16:37] support and really believe in.
[00:16:38] So lets talk about that for a little bit
[00:16:40] and then we can
wrap up the video.
[00:16:43] This video was made possible by
[00:16:44] a sponsor, that I have
been working with
[00:16:46] for the last year.
[00:16:48] And planned to work with
for some time now
[00:16:50] called MINDLABPRO.
[00:16:52] Now I have taken supplements in the past.
[00:16:54]  I've sworn by other supplements
[00:16:55] in the past too. 
While they worked for me
[00:16:58] at the time.
[00:16:59] I never experimented
[00:17:00] with anything like nootropics before.
[00:17:02] And Mind Lab Pro is the first nootropics
[00:17:05] that I ever seriously
[00:17:07] dedicated myself to.
[00:17:08] To involve it into my mental training
[00:17:10] and preparation for competitions
[00:17:12] and memories feats and stuff like that.
[00:17:14] And overall just to keep my
mind sharp every single day.
[00:17:17] What I do requires a lot of that.
[00:17:19] So it's perfect! Now what makes
Mine Lab Pro
[00:17:21] so unique is that it's the
[00:17:23] world's first universal
[00:17:25] Nootropic.
[00:17:26] So unlike any other nootropic
[00:17:28] on the market,
[00:17:28] which typically they just target
[00:17:30] one or two pathways meaning
[00:17:32] they focus on
[00:17:33] like one thing like memory or focus.
[00:17:35] You know specifically one of those
or couple of those.
[00:17:38] Mind Lab pro target as many pathways
[00:17:41] as possible six to be..
[00:17:43] exact to optimize all areas of cognition.
[00:17:46] Not only it helps my memory
[00:17:47] focus but it'll touch on other aspects
of my cognitive function
[00:17:50] to make it all around
[00:17:52] a more powerfull
better tuned brain.
[00:17:55] Anyways check them out, I love them!
[00:17:57] I take it every day
[00:17:58] and I do see a difference
[00:17:59] personally that's why my opinion.
[00:18:01] If you learn more about Mind Lap Pro,
[00:18:03] go to the website mindlabpro.com
[00:18:05] where you can see the link
in the description
[00:18:07] and see if it works for you.
[00:18:08] That's is for this video.
[00:18:09] Thanks for watching...
[00:18:10] Namaste! I will see you in the next video
[00:18:13] I am out.


=== The Happiness Test (try this RIGHT now) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pZLKZ8fL-E

[00:00:44] Alright! So, we just
got back from Everest.
[00:00:46] I'm back in Kathmandu
in a hotel
[00:00:48] and...
[00:00:49] This video is gonna
be a bit of a little chat.
[00:00:53] Although, there's gonna
be some take-aways for you.
[00:00:55] Something really
valuable that I learned...
[00:00:57] Let's say 8 months ago...
[00:00:59] From a colleague of mine
Jesse Itzler.
[00:01:02] Great guy, uhhh...
He has taught me a lot.
[00:01:05] I love his mentality and...
[00:01:06] He has this amazing test,
"The Happiness Test"
[00:01:10] that I want you
guys to try right now.
[00:01:12] This is how it works...
Alright!
[00:01:14] So, I want you to take
everything in your life
[00:01:16] alright.
[00:01:17] Imagine your relationships,
[00:01:20] your health,
[00:01:21] your parents, your work,
where you live...
[00:01:25] All these little details.
[00:01:26] Everything in your life
[00:01:28] and just put in a blender
[00:01:30] mix it all up
[00:01:32] and...
[00:01:34] You've got this bucket of
stuff - 'life.'
[00:01:37] Right?
[00:01:37] And what I want you to do is to
[00:01:40] give it a score.
[00:01:42] From 1 to 10...
[00:01:43] And be as honest, with
yourself as possible
[00:01:46] This doesn't work 
unless you do that.
[00:01:48] And when you do that...
[00:01:51] Think of 10, as the best right!
[00:01:53] Your perfect happiness,
[00:01:56] the Dalai Lama,
[00:01:58] right! Where 1, is
lower than rock bottom.
[00:02:02] Now, be as honest with
yourself take a moment and just
[00:02:04] give yourself a score.
[00:02:06] Now, I can't do a poll here,
[00:02:07] but what tends to happen
[00:02:10] is... Most people will think
about a 7.
[00:02:14] Right!
[00:02:14] Obviously, there's gonna be people
little higher
[00:02:17] Alot of people are gonna be
maybe lower.
[00:02:20] Uhh, but a 7 or less is probably what
most people will have.
[00:02:25] What did you score?
[00:02:26] For me... I was
around a 7 or 7 and half.
[00:02:29] It can fluctuate, but
it's same around there.
[00:02:32] Now me...
[00:02:34] Showing you, what your score is
of how happy you are...
[00:02:37] That's not that interesting.
[00:02:38] I think what is the most interesting,
is what happens in your brain
[00:02:41] when you do that
little self-assessment.
[00:02:44] This is what happens.
[00:02:45] When I tell you to think about,
[00:02:47] where you are
what your number is?
[00:02:48] You immediately go to attempt.
[00:02:51] We all do...
[00:02:52] If not, most of us.
[00:02:54] And what will happen is, okay
then you start to say well...
[00:02:58] I'd be a 10 but then, this
part of my life isn't so great.
[00:03:01] So maybe take a point out
or half a point out.
[00:03:04] And then, this
thing could be better
[00:03:06] so, maybe take another point out.
[00:03:07] And then, you settle
somewhere right?
[00:03:10] And for me, I settle around a 7
[00:03:11] right.
[00:03:12] So that means there are
[00:03:14] some things, preventing
me from having a 10.
[00:03:16] Now, what to take
away from this test is...
[00:03:20] is what you immediately thought,
[00:03:23] was impacting your
happiness score.
[00:03:27] Those were the things
you need to work on
[00:03:29] right.
[00:03:29] Those are the things
that are preventing you supposedly,
[00:03:32] from being happy.
[00:03:33] This doesn't sound so crazy but
[00:03:35] when you are putting that perspective,
you say well...
[00:03:38] Yeah, maybe those
things aren't so great.
[00:03:40] And, if I have so many
years left in my life,
[00:03:44] you know I'm 37.
[00:03:45] I'm walking around with the 7 right!
[00:03:48] A 'C' that's a C minus
[00:03:50] barely better than a 'D'
[00:03:52] in happiness in my life.
[00:03:53] Like what else am I doing in my life,
if I'm not trying to be happy.
[00:03:56] And I'm just walking day to day
[00:03:59] happy with the C? -minus?
[00:04:02] No, that doesn't feel right.
[00:04:04] Right!
[00:04:05] Like, maybe another thing
[00:04:06] yeah fitness, maybe
I can deal with a C
[00:04:08] Uhhh, maybe money
is could be a C, right?
[00:04:12] But happiness in my life,
there's nothing more important.
[00:04:15] Why is that not on 8 atleast?
[00:04:17] Why is that not on 9?
[00:04:18] How can I make it a 10?
[00:04:20] So what's powerful
about this exercise is that
[00:04:21] the things would be attracted
from your score.
[00:04:23] Those were the immediate
things that you need to work on,
[00:04:26] to boost your score.
[00:04:28] And so for me,
when I did this test
[00:04:30] number of months back
[00:04:31] I realised, it was mountains.
[00:04:34] I'm missing mountains in my life.
[00:04:35] That's a big detractive for me.
[00:04:37] I live in Miami...
[00:04:39] I grew up here,
but I hate the beach.
[00:04:41] I hate water sports,
[00:04:44] I hate going to the beach,
I hate the constant heat.
[00:04:48] So why am I here?
[00:04:50] I love the mountains, I love snow.
[00:04:51] I love, being able to go outside
in the wilderness.
[00:04:55] And... Go up.
[00:04:58] You know on rock, snow, glacier.
[00:05:01] Why is that not part of my life?
[00:05:03] If that's the only thing
that's limitating me
[00:05:05] or one of the things
that's limitating me from
[00:05:07] my happiness score
being atleast at 8 or a 9...
[00:05:11] That's a simple thing to change!
[00:05:13] I move...
[00:05:14] Or I find a way to be
closer to the mountains.
[00:05:32] Which leads me to my next point.
[00:05:34] "The importance of sticking to things."
[00:05:37] Things that... will lend itself
to your happiness ultimately.
[00:05:41] Right.
[00:05:41] So...
[00:05:43] When we think
about happiness right,
[00:05:44] there's things that
you can do immediately
[00:05:46] and be happy.
[00:05:47] And that feels good...
[00:05:48] It satiates ourselves,
we feel happy in the moment.
[00:05:51] But a lot of times,
that doesn't last, right?
[00:05:54] So, when we are talking
about happiness,
[00:05:56] it's really uhhh...
A long term thing here.
[00:06:00] We want to be happy feeling...
[00:06:04] Thinking back on
our whole life right,
[00:06:06] not just instance.
[00:06:07] It's gonna be
over the span of our life
[00:06:09] so over the span of the
last decade or something.
[00:06:12] You wanna feel overall content
and happy, with what you've done
[00:06:15] and where you're headed and..
[00:06:16] Where you're at.
[00:06:17] So it's tempting to think that 
to make yourself happy
[00:06:19] just do more of the things
that make you immediately happy.
[00:06:21] But that's not always the case,
[00:06:23] Right?
[00:06:23] Happiness, I think comes from...
[00:06:28] Obviously doing things that
make you happy over long term.
[00:06:31] But also doing things that aren't so
[00:06:35] immediately ratifying,
things for the long term.
[00:06:38] And it's gonna like that
type 2 fun you know... When you
[00:06:40] do something that's fun in the moment.
[00:06:44] Cool that's fun...
[00:06:45] But it's not like this last thing,
feeling of fun.
[00:06:48] But when you do something
that's type-2 fun
[00:06:50] it's kind of miserable,
challenging when you do it.
[00:06:52] But afterwards, you look back on it
and you're like, "That was fun."
[00:06:56] "I wanna do that again.
[00:06:57] I'm happy that I did that,
that made me
[00:06:59] very satisfied on the fun meter
or the happiness meter."
[00:07:03] So, happiness I think is the same way.
[00:07:04] It's... sticking to things that
make you happy for the long term.
[00:07:09] I know that doesn't
sound very revolutionary.
[00:07:12] But uhh... It's true.
[00:07:14] And I think about,
[00:07:15] I have had alot of time to
reflect on my climbing here.
[00:07:19] You know, I have tried Everest
4 times, and I haven't summited.
[00:07:22] And while that's disappointing,
[00:07:24] uhh, in some sense because I have
always wanted to stand on top of the world.
[00:07:28] You know, I've come to realizations
over the last 4 expeditions that
[00:07:31] it's more about the journey
[00:07:32] right?
[00:07:33] That's really what I'm after...
[00:07:35] Yet, I come back aiming
to get to the summit.
[00:07:38] Well that's part of that
I guess, I also enjoy the trip too.
[00:07:41] I wanna re-experience that
and have that happiness in my life.
[00:07:43] But what I realize is,
I'm very happy
[00:07:46] and proud of the fact that
I have stuck to this
[00:07:50] goal and this dream of mine
for the last 10+ years.
[00:07:55] And while that's a long time
to have to train,
[00:07:57] and to think about the
money that goes into Everest,
[00:08:00] finding sponsors and
[00:08:01] putting myself through
the whole processes
[00:08:03] of climbing Everest, which is...
[00:08:05] Super demanding.
[00:08:06] Uhh I have lost 30 pounds and
you know, my families at home and
[00:08:10] uhhh... It's difficult.
[00:08:11] But I'm very happy in
terms of the story of my life
[00:08:15] with what I've done with it.
[00:08:17] And that comes from
having stuck to something,
[00:08:21] that I know makes me
happy, for a long time.
[00:08:24] And I think, that's
really important
[00:08:26] "The importance
of sticking to things"
[00:08:28] in relation to
how that makes you happy.
[00:08:30] Being able to target,
[00:08:32] you know the simple things
that you need.
[00:08:34] That help you make your
score higher, to make you happy.
[00:08:38] And... trying to
incorporate that in your life
[00:08:41] somewhat consistently.
[00:08:43] Uhh, obviously I can't climb
Everest all the time.
[00:08:45] But it's not really about that,
[00:08:47] it's about the mountains and
having some sense of challenge
[00:08:50] for... Having have
that for the last 10 years,
[00:08:54] where, you know while I
want more mountains in my life...
[00:08:57] I do feel that,
[00:09:00] I'm leading a version
of my life that is,
[00:09:03] lending itself to happiness.
[00:09:06] For me, that makes sense.
[00:09:07] So, what am I getting down to...
[00:09:09] Well one, do the happiness test!
[00:09:12] Figure out what your score is.
[00:09:14] Figure out the things
detracting from your score.
[00:09:17] Work on those things.
[00:09:18] Those were the things that
you now know,
[00:09:20]  that you need to work on
[00:09:21] to maximize your score and be happier.
[00:09:24] And I think, that last little
step is to take those things and...
[00:09:29] If you can't have it everyday,
[00:09:31] atleast try to incorporate it,
on some consistent basis
[00:09:34] for a long period of time.
[00:09:37] Now, obviously
setting long goals and
[00:09:38] sticking to things for
a long time is hard.
[00:09:40] But if it's something that you know,
will make you happy
[00:09:43] I don't think, it's that hard
to incorporate it
[00:09:45] uhhh, for the long term.
[00:09:47] You just gotta realize,
what it is and act on it.
[00:09:51] I think, that's my point here.
[00:09:52] So, just a bit of rambling.
[00:09:54] Some thoughts , I have more
thoughts on my Everest climb.
[00:09:57] Some more videos coming up
about it but...
[00:09:59] I just wanted to share that little
happiness test with you.
[00:10:02] For those who is struggling out there or
[00:10:04] kind of unsure
where you're on life
[00:10:06] maybe this will help you
[00:10:07] uhh, get on track just a little bit.
[00:10:09] And...
[00:10:11] Thank you guys, so
much for listening to me.
[00:10:12] I will be back home very soon.
[00:10:14] Please like and subscribe, share
[00:10:16] and looking forward to the
rest of this year with you guys and...
[00:10:19] Who knows, maybe I will leave Florida
[00:10:21] and move to mountains
sooner than you think.
[00:10:24] I'm up.


=== 5 Most Useful Knots (and how to MEMORIZE them) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxkXD9l2B54

[00:00:10] One of my favourite
things to do is to tie knots
[00:00:13] But like most people,
I don't always learn them very easily.
[00:00:17] Someone will show me a knot,
[00:00:18] and I'll need to see it a 100 times,
before I can do it on my own.
[00:00:22] That is unless there's a catchy, fun,
simple mnemonic to help me!
[00:00:25] Since I'm on Everest
for the next few weeks...
[00:00:27] I figured, I could teach you 5
of the most useful knots
[00:00:30] with an easy mnemonic,
that will help you remember them quickly.
[00:00:33] So grab yourself
a piece of rope...
[00:00:34] A piece of string, shoelace,
some floss or heck
[00:00:37] even a piece of cooked
spaghetti will do the trick.
[00:00:39] And let's get started...
[00:00:41] Alright so...
[00:00:43] Got some rope here.
[00:00:46] And the first one
we gonna talk about is...
[00:00:49] The Figure 8, also known as
the 'Flemish Knot'.
[00:00:52] My mother's Flemish
so, I gotta say that.
[00:00:54] Basically, the Figure 8
[00:00:55] you're gonna use,
on a lot of situations.
[00:00:57] If you've ever gone rock climbing
[00:00:59] and you didn't know,
how to do Figure 8...
[00:01:00] So it's a pretty secure knot,
often used in climbing.
[00:01:03] So it's really fun one
to remember too.
[00:01:06] The mnemonic goes like this...
[00:01:08] 'This is Charlie, give him a scarf,
poke him in the face.'
[00:01:12] And what do I mean by that?
[00:01:13] Let's do a demonstration
[00:01:15] and I'll do a slower
version of this as well.
[00:01:18] I can't get this undone.
[00:01:20] Alright this is Charlie...
[00:01:22] Give him a scarf,
[00:01:23] so wrap it around him.
[00:01:24] And then poke him
in the face.
[00:01:28] There is your Figure 8.
[00:01:31] Simple as that.
[00:01:32] This is Charlie...
[00:01:34] Give him a scarf...
[00:01:40] Poke him in the face.
[00:01:46] Now this, conserve is a stopper
[00:01:48] if you want.
[00:01:49] But typically, what you'll do is...
[00:01:52] You give yourself
quite a lot of slack here.
[00:01:54] Do that thing.
[00:01:55] Here is Charlie...
Give him a scarf.
[00:01:58] poke him in the face.
[00:02:00] And then, what you'll do is...
You'll take this loop
[00:02:03] and guide it through
your harness, your belay
[00:02:06] will put whatever you
guys have going on.
[00:02:07] And then you'll feed this...
[00:02:10] This end, back
through the Figure 8.
[00:02:12] And what you'll get is basically
[00:02:14] Figure 8 on a bight.
[00:02:16] So you can do, a Figure 8
on a bight as well...
[00:02:19] If instead of just saying,
this is Charlie...
[00:02:24] Grab a bight!
[00:02:25] This will be called a bight,
[00:02:26] and do the same thing.
[00:02:28] So we double a rope
[00:02:29] This is Charlie...
[00:02:31] Give him a scarf...
[00:02:35] And then poke him in the face.
[00:02:39] And there we go...
[00:02:40] You have a Figure 8 with a bight.
[00:02:42] And this you can clip
in to a biner
[00:02:45] or wrap around
something whatever.
[00:02:47] Uh... What you do wanna do that is
make sure that it's well dressed.
[00:02:50] We're gonna go into that
right now but...
[00:02:52] You wanted to look nice!
[00:02:54] It's often times that,
when you do this knot...
[00:02:56] This can be kind
of a mess,
[00:02:58] things are over each other
in the wrong way.
[00:02:59] That's not very nice.
[00:03:01] So you wanna make sure
it's well dressed but...
[00:03:04] As long as you get the basic
mnemonic, about Charlie and the scarf
[00:03:07] poke him in the face.
[00:03:08] You're good to go.
[00:03:08] Alright, let me pause the video
just for a moment
[00:03:10] to talk about the sponsor that
is able to make this video possible.
[00:03:14] And that is atlasVPN.
[00:03:16] Let me tell you a little bit about them
since we're talking about knots.
[00:03:19] Your life could very well
get into a...
[00:03:21] really complicated knot.
[00:03:22] If you don't have some way of
protecting yourself online
[00:03:26] and making the stuff that you look
and access on the web
[00:03:29] secure as possible.
[00:03:30] On top of that,
[00:03:31] atlasVPN has a great
discount going on right now.
[00:03:33] So check out the link
in the description.
[00:03:35] Now, if you're not using a VPN
in this day and age
[00:03:37] you're out of your mind.
[00:03:39] atlasVPN encrypts all of your data
[00:03:41] and is a great help for
real life everyday situations.
[00:03:44] For example you know,
[00:03:45] accessing Geo block libraries on
streaming platforms like...
[00:03:48] Netflix, Amazon Prime,
hulu, HBOmax and more.
[00:03:52] To avoid censorships
when travelling abroad.
[00:03:54] And in general, just to increase your 
security on public internet connection.
[00:03:57] A great example of
using a VPN is
[00:03:59] when I'm trying to watch one of
my favorite shows
[00:04:02] which is Top Gear.
[00:04:03] It's only available in UK
on Netflix.
[00:04:05] I live in the US, so I use my VPN
[00:04:08] just like this to get access
to the library
[00:04:12] available on Netflix UK
and voila
[00:04:15] I can now watch my favorite shows.
[00:04:16] Currently atlasVPN has a great 
promotion going on.
[00:04:19] They are offering their
services for three years.
[00:04:21] 1.39 a month.
[00:04:23] for those 3 years.
You are saving over 86%
[00:04:26] on the whole cost
of having a VPN
[00:04:28] which you need anyway 
to be honest.
[00:04:30] And on top of that, it comes
with a 30-day money back guarantee.
[00:04:33] So if you don't like the services,
doesn't make sense for you,
[00:04:35] then you can get your
money back.
[00:04:37] The deal won't last for long so 
please make sure to click
[00:04:39] the link in the description below.
[00:04:41] Now, back to learning
about knots.
[00:04:48] It's getting hot.
[00:04:49] It was so overcast 
just a moment ago.
[00:04:51] Alright, our next knot is 
called the square knot
[00:04:55] or the reef knot.
[00:04:56] Now, you make kind of know 
this already,
[00:05:00] it's not quite a reef knot,
[00:05:01] but well, you've been 
taught to tie your shoes.
[00:05:04] It's actually an 
over-hand knot but,
[00:05:05] it's a slight variation
on the square knot.
[00:05:07] Now, get this,
[00:05:09] we all hate tying our shoes.
We always double-knot our shoes
[00:05:11] because they come undone 
with a crappy knot, right?
[00:05:15] Well that's because, the overhand
you are doing, is wrong.
[00:05:18] If you do the overhand
the other way,
[00:05:20] if you get yourself 
a reef knot,
[00:05:21] then actually,
it stays a lot more secure.
[00:05:24] It's not the most secure knot
in the world,
[00:05:26] but it will stay more secure
if you do the reef knot
[00:05:29] instead of the over-hand knot.
[00:05:30] I'll show you what I mean
with the shoelaces in just a moment.
[00:05:42] So this knot isn't super reliable
as I said before
[00:05:45] but it's good for quick 
little things like tying your shoes
[00:05:48] tying strings or a little bow
on your gift wrapping.
[00:05:52] Also tying sealed covers, tent flies,
things that are super quick.
[00:05:55] And that secure and safety isn't like
of the upmost importance
[00:05:59] just something quick
and reliable.
[00:06:00] It's a good knot for 
tying two ends
[00:06:04] of a rope or two separate 
ropes together.
[00:06:07] So think about shoelaces, 
you're putting them together.
[00:06:09] If you have two ends of the rope
and you want them to get together,
[00:06:12] this is how it goes,
here's the mnemonic.
[00:06:14] "Right over left, left over right,
makes a reef knot, both tidy and tight."
[00:06:19] So you take your right one,
[00:06:21] put it over the left,
[00:06:23] and I have these two ends and 
then the left goes over the right
[00:06:27] and through...
[00:06:29] and voila
[00:06:30] This is what a reef knot
looks like.
[00:06:32] And you can tell you have done 
it right 'cuz it looks tidy and tight.
[00:06:35] And that's pretty good.
[00:06:35] The more you pull on it,
the more tightened it gets.
[00:06:38] Right over left,
left over right
[00:06:41] makes a reef knot
that's tidy and tight.
[00:06:46] Alright, this one's great and it's 
called the Alpine butterfly
[00:06:49] and this is used a lot
in mountaineering when
[00:06:51] you got a rope and 
you want to
[00:06:54] kinda connect into 
the middle of the rope.
[00:06:56] So what you do?
[00:06:57] It's a butterfly knot.
[00:06:58] So what we are gonna think about
is a butterfly. That's our mnemonic.
[00:07:02] You can imagine the pathway
of this butterfly-
[00:07:05] goes across your hand 
towards your thumb
[00:07:09] and then goes wrapping around
the front of your fingertips
[00:07:12] and guides back
[00:07:14] to where your thumb was.
[00:07:16] So you'll have this little bit
across your fingertips
[00:07:19] and then this kind of X shape
in the middle of your palm.
[00:07:22] And what you will do 
is you'll guide this loop
[00:07:24] think of the butterfly wing,
[00:07:26] underneath and up-through.
[00:07:36] Holy sh**
[00:07:41] That's a big fu*king
ice-fall wow!
[00:07:45] So anyways, here, is your
butterfly knot.
[00:07:48] You've taken a section of rope
that might be tied to two ends
[00:07:51] and you've basically made
a loop in the middle of it.
[00:07:55] Pretty secure. Won't budge much.
[00:07:57] And like I said, it's great for clipping 
end in this middle section of rope.
[00:08:01] So you are just guiding
that butterfly around.
[00:08:03] so you lay it
on your palm,
[00:08:04] guide it towards your thumb
[00:08:07] wrap it around the fingertips
of the top
[00:08:09] have it cross over
[00:08:11] and you can have it lay on 
your thumb and make this cross,
[00:08:13] and then, loop it under..
[00:08:19] both through..
[00:08:20] and there..
And just pull on each end.
[00:08:22] You got your secure
butterfly knot.
[00:08:29] Alright, our next knot
is the bowline.
[00:08:32] Now, this is used a lot 
in sailing.
[00:08:35] It's a really good knot
to tie around something
[00:08:37] like I'm wearing
or a tent fly even.
[00:08:39] Pretty secure, under a load,
it won't budge much
[00:08:42] but when there's no load,
it's easy to undo.
[00:08:44] So the mnemonic goes like this:
[00:08:45] The rabbit comes out of the hole,
goes around the tree
[00:08:49] and back down into the hole.
[00:08:51] So you have your hanging
end of your rope here,
[00:08:54] Make a hole, okay?
[00:08:56] Have the rabbit come up
through the hole,
[00:09:00] around the tree,
[00:09:02] and then back down
into the hole.
[00:09:05] And make sure  to keep
a little loop at the end here,
[00:09:07] tighten it and that's your bowline.
[00:09:10] So the rope that you are holding 
in your  left hand is the tree.
[00:09:13] And you are gonna make a loop
that sits on top of the tree.
[00:09:16] That's the hole, then the rabbit
goes up through the hole.
[00:09:19] The tail end is the rabbit,
[00:09:22] goes around that tree
and then
[00:09:24] back down into the hole
or back through the loop that it came from.
[00:09:28] Then pull it tight.
[00:09:32] Alright, this last one 
is called a clove hitch
[00:09:35] and this is a nice little thing
[00:09:37] to attach to
a stationary object as well.
[00:09:39] Basically how it goes, let's imagine
you have some kind of pole.
[00:09:42] ..Ah this is my ice axe.
[00:09:44] But the way it works, 
mnemonic is,
[00:09:46] loop right around the pole,
[00:09:48] loop left around the pole,
[00:09:50] and then up through
the hole.
[00:09:52] And then tighten it.
[00:09:53] Alright, so you loop
right around the pole,
[00:09:56] then loop left around the pole on the
top of that other loop you just did.
[00:10:00] And then, up through the hole.
[00:10:03] Right in between both of them
and then, well, tight.
[00:10:07] And there is your clove hitch.
[00:10:09] Now, it's pretty secure. It will come
undone if you pull too much on it but
[00:10:14] for a quick little hitch,
[00:10:17] something you wanna attach to,
stationary object, this is great.
[00:10:20] Now, another version of this,
[00:10:22] it's little more fun to remember
the mnemonic for.
[00:10:25] Um, as if say,
[00:10:27] you have like,
[00:10:28] a biner or something that
you want to
[00:10:30] take this hitch and attach it to.
[00:10:33] It's one thing if you have
the stationary
[00:10:36] pole in front, you can
wrap around it.
[00:10:38] But what if you just want,
let's say in the middle of a rope
[00:10:41] to do that.
[00:10:42] No problem.
[00:10:43] So, the mnemonic goes,
[00:10:46] Mickey ears in the back,
[00:10:47] (so fold it in the back)
[00:10:49] Mickey ears in the front,
[00:10:51] and then put the first ear
over the first
[00:10:54] and then, there is your loop.
[00:10:57] Put your carabiner or whatever you are 
trying to attach it to.
[00:11:00] Oops...
And there you go.
[00:11:02] There is your clove hitch
[00:11:04] on a biner.
[00:11:05] Nice.
[00:11:05] Mickey ears in the back,
Mickey ears in the front
[00:11:07] Put the front ear
over the second ear
[00:11:10] Pull tight.
[00:11:11] Alright guys, that's it for this video.
Short and sweet.
[00:11:14] Hopefully something useful and
[00:11:16] I don't know, maybe there's some
mnemonics you never heard of
[00:11:19] for those knots.
[00:11:20] Obviously with a bit of practice,
you'll have them down
[00:11:23] But obviously you don't wanna 
be always saying
[00:11:25] the mnemonic when you do it
but it's a good way to learn it.
[00:11:28] As it's everything. Mnemonics help
to get it to your brain
[00:11:31] and then once you practice it,
make it muscle memory,
[00:11:33] it's in there. You don't
need to use a mnemonic.
[00:11:35] That's it. I'm exhausted.
[00:11:37] Just tying some knots here
at 17500 feet.
[00:11:42] Ima go back to camp
and lay down.
[00:11:43] Hope you enjoyed that one.
[00:11:44] See you in the next video. Please like, 
share, subscribe. All those things.
[00:11:48] Take it easy. I'm out.


=== I GOT SCAMMED BY BIJAY SHAHI (HERE'S THE UNDENIABLE PROOF...) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-oD0zvsOCQ

[00:00:00] this video is made possible by Atlas
[00:00:04] [Music]
[00:00:05] VPN another BJ Shahi
[00:00:08] video I'm so
[00:00:12] [Music]
[00:00:17] sorry I swear this is the last thing I
[00:00:20] ever utter about BJ Shahi okay I've
[00:00:24] wasted enough time on this guy goodness
[00:00:26] me all right here's a story I didn't
[00:00:28] even think I'd make a reaction video I
[00:00:30] thought I'd just put my last interview
[00:00:31] out and that would be that nope but
[00:00:33] there has been an uproar and honestly I
[00:00:36] can't thank you guys enough all those
[00:00:38] viewers you know I really was happy that
[00:00:41] I put the video out there for you to
[00:00:42] judge and collectively you guys figured
[00:00:45] it out all right let me just come out
[00:00:46] and say it I got scammed by BJ Shahi I
[00:00:51] did I'm not going to pretend like I
[00:00:52] didn't he got me he got me good but with
[00:00:54] all of your reactions you helped me kind
[00:00:56] of reassess and review what happened in
[00:00:59] the interview and a lot of the things
[00:01:01] you guys are saying are I think in the
[00:01:04] right direction I don't know if it's as
[00:01:06] simple as you guys make it sound there's
[00:01:08] some things that are wrong with your
[00:01:10] ideas or theories of what happened but
[00:01:12] there are specific things that I can
[00:01:14] prove and I will prove it in this video
[00:01:17] that without a doubt show that this was
[00:01:19] a scam and that BJ is full of crap for
[00:01:23] those of you who are new to this channel
[00:01:24] welcome I typically don't just focus on
[00:01:27] uh scam artists or people who claim to
[00:01:29] have good memories although I do react
[00:01:31] occasionally to those kinds of things
[00:01:32] usually you'll find memory tips and
[00:01:34] helpful things so from now on we're
[00:01:37] going back to that and if you're a new
[00:01:38] subscriber thank you you will see more
[00:01:40] of that content coming up and to bring
[00:01:42] you up to speed there's this guy BJ
[00:01:44] Shahi he called himself the memory King
[00:01:47] he claimed to do these crazy things
[00:01:48] where he could memorize a book in 10
[00:01:50] minutes and he's been outed been called
[00:01:53] a scam artist a fraud I reacted to one
[00:01:55] of his videos and invited him for an
[00:01:57] interview I could challenge him and
[00:01:59] figure out
[00:02:00] if he's real or not anyways I happened
[00:02:02] to be in Nepal recently we did the
[00:02:04] interview I posted the interview it did
[00:02:07] not sit well with most people and I try
[00:02:09] to keep myself as non-biased as possible
[00:02:11] just an interviewer asking questions
[00:02:14] observing what he's doing and let you
[00:02:16] guys make the decision but I have some
[00:02:19] things to say I have specific evidence
[00:02:21] that undeniably shows that BJ what he
[00:02:24] did in the interview that it's a
[00:02:25] complete show it's a scam it's a whole
[00:02:28] act but first let's go over some of the
[00:02:31] theories and ideas that some people have
[00:02:32] had in the comments cuz they're very
[00:02:34] good and probably very close to the
[00:02:36] truth so I'm using uh footage from
[00:02:38] misguided Nepal right which is a channel
[00:02:41] that has posted a really well edited
[00:02:43] video analyzing my interview and we're
[00:02:46] going to go through the points that this
[00:02:48] person makes and what I think about them
[00:02:51] maybe give a little more context I want
[00:02:52] to provide all the information that is
[00:02:55] out there I like to play Devil's
[00:02:56] Advocate so everybody can have all the
[00:02:59] information or as much information as
[00:03:00] possible before they make their final
[00:03:02] decision but first let's talk about this
[00:03:04] video sponsor since this video is all
[00:03:07] about being scammed and being possibly
[00:03:09] hacked sort of I wish that I had a way
[00:03:11] to protect myself and that might
[00:03:14] translate to how you might want to
[00:03:15] protect yourself on the internet so let
[00:03:17] me tell you a little bit about Atlas VPN
[00:03:19] it's a great tool to keep your stuff
[00:03:21] private online and stay Anonymous on the
[00:03:23] web on top of that they got a great
[00:03:24] discount going on right now so make sure
[00:03:26] to check out the link in the description
[00:03:28] now if you're not using a VPN then
[00:03:30] you're no better than me getting scammed
[00:03:31] by BJ Shahi in this video now Atlas VPN
[00:03:34] encrypts all the data you send but it's
[00:03:36] also a great help for real life everyday
[00:03:38] situations for example you know
[00:03:40] accessing geoblock libraries on
[00:03:41] streaming platforms like Netflix Amazon
[00:03:44] Prime Hulu HBO and more to avoid
[00:03:46] censorship when you're traveling abroad
[00:03:48] and in general just to increase your
[00:03:49] security on public internet connections
[00:03:51] so for example I like to watch Top Gear
[00:03:53] it's one of my favorite shows but it's
[00:03:55] only available for streaming on Netflix
[00:03:57] UK I'm in the US so I use my VPN just
[00:04:00] like this to get access to the library
[00:04:03] available on Netflix UK and voila there
[00:04:06] is my Top Gear also they got this great
[00:04:08] feature called data breach monitor the
[00:04:10] tool scans the internet to see if your
[00:04:12] email ended up in any recorded data
[00:04:14] breaches or data dumps that included
[00:04:16] emails names passwords and other
[00:04:18] sensitive information pretty cool
[00:04:20] currently Atlas VPN is running a huge
[00:04:22] discount on their threeyear deal for
[00:04:24] just $139 per month with a 30-day money
[00:04:27] back guarantee the deal won't last for
[00:04:28] long so make sure to check it out by
[00:04:30] clicking the link in the video
[00:04:31] description below and now back to the
[00:04:33] video where we prove that BJ Shahi is a
[00:04:35] phony let's dive
[00:04:38] in the woman in the video somehow
[00:04:41] switched out the papers she recorded it
[00:04:43] and wrote the answer and then somehow
[00:04:45] swapped it when I wasn't looking now
[00:04:47] I'll say before
[00:04:49] anything this is very possible that it
[00:04:52] happened I'm not ruling it out but I
[00:04:53] will provide some reasons why maybe some
[00:04:57] of that might be might have been more
[00:04:59] challenging than you as a viewer might
[00:05:02] think but I definitely there's one thing
[00:05:06] and nobody's actually brought this up
[00:05:07] there's one thing that to
[00:05:09] me makes this entire thing look super
[00:05:12] fishy and it's not the girl it's not the
[00:05:15] tears on the paper I'll show you what it
[00:05:17] is but I want to address a couple things
[00:05:18] that I'm seeing here uh from this
[00:05:21] person's commentary so he says here that
[00:05:23] uh you know the divine power is a lot of
[00:05:26] what BJ explains his powers or skill to
[00:05:30] be and here they're saying that that's
[00:05:32] actually not quite what he said in past
[00:05:33] interviews I didn't know that um very
[00:05:35] interesting to me if if I knew that I
[00:05:37] would have drilled him a little harder
[00:05:38] on that question I don't like that
[00:05:40] answer it doesn't sit well with me it's
[00:05:41] such a copout like come on also another
[00:05:44] person said that when I asked him when
[00:05:46] did you realize you had this power and
[00:05:47] he said 2 years I thought he meant when
[00:05:50] since he was 2 years old which would
[00:05:52] have been a little more reasonable okay
[00:05:54] it's a god-given gift great okay you
[00:05:56] were born with it cool but I think from
[00:05:58] my misunderstanding it's actually 2
[00:06:01] years ago which to me is absurd like you
[00:06:05] don't just unless you're hit in the head
[00:06:07] by a baseball bat uh your brain somehow
[00:06:10] gets injured that you suddenly realize
[00:06:12] you have this ability it doesn't happen
[00:06:14] like that um so that already is another
[00:06:17] annoying red
[00:06:19] flag all right one thing about this lady
[00:06:22] she didn't really speak good English uh
[00:06:24] we barely interacted she gave me or
[00:06:27] offered me coffee here brought me a
[00:06:28] water brought her food um she seemed to
[00:06:31] be the assistant of his office but I
[00:06:33] will say they were very hospitable right
[00:06:36] all she's doing here seemingly is being
[00:06:39] a nice host right bringing me coffee
[00:06:41] bringing me water that's a nice thing to
[00:06:43] do right I didn't think anything of it
[00:06:45] when I was uh in the room another thing
[00:06:47] to note people were saying you know
[00:06:49] shoot they had a plan they were going to
[00:06:51] record what he said but let me remind
[00:06:54] you here's one of my counterarguments if
[00:06:56] you will they didn't know I was going to
[00:06:58] do a single page
[00:07:00] right you could see from the interview
[00:07:02] that you they thought that I was going
[00:07:03] to ask to do the entire book now there's
[00:07:06] no way BJ was going to sit there reading
[00:07:08] the entire book from start to finish out
[00:07:11] loud right that would have taken at
[00:07:12] least 10 hours okay and if she was
[00:07:16] recording the whole thing how are they
[00:07:18] going to know how to find the page I was
[00:07:20] going to ask them about right now they
[00:07:21] may have had another plan planned out in
[00:07:24] the case that I did that who knows right
[00:07:26] but for those of you saying that they
[00:07:28] had this figured out I know he steps
[00:07:30] away from the room for a little bit but
[00:07:33] is that enough time to say like hey
[00:07:34] let's do plan b or did they have this
[00:07:36] planned out in some capacity they just
[00:07:38] said let's do that uh scam uh you know
[00:07:41] scam B the one that we talked about
[00:07:43] before in case he asked this blah blah
[00:07:45] blah I don't know it seems pretty tough
[00:07:47] to have figured out a way to do this
[00:07:50] with me right there in the room that's
[00:07:52] pretty ballsy but you know if he's a
[00:07:55] true scam artist if he's a true
[00:07:56] Illusionist magician kind of guy these
[00:07:59] kind of people are well prepared on how
[00:08:01] to fool people so who knows perhaps now
[00:08:04] we see she takes out a phone here it's
[00:08:06] black now one thing the guy says in this
[00:08:08] video hang on is that she puts it by the
[00:08:11] sink I don't think this really matters
[00:08:13] but I don't think she did put it by the
[00:08:15] sink cuz watch you can see here you can
[00:08:18] see in the corner here that she's
[00:08:19] putting something in her back pocket I
[00:08:21] would assume it's her phone again it
[00:08:23] doesn't matter if the phone's there you
[00:08:25] know she could have recorded it from in
[00:08:27] the room from just outside the room when
[00:08:29] the door was closed I don't know but
[00:08:31] just to point that out that I don't know
[00:08:32] if that's quite accurate what she's what
[00:08:34] this person is saying and here even if
[00:08:36] you were to look I think in her backside
[00:08:38] pocket you can actually see the outline
[00:08:39] of the phone so I think the phone is on
[00:08:41] her again is that does that really make
[00:08:44] a difference I don't think so but just
[00:08:45] to point that out now I do remember when
[00:08:48] this was happening I was like come on
[00:08:49] dude what why are you getting out of the
[00:08:51] room so many times what are you up to
[00:08:53] now and then when he came back with a
[00:08:54] little um kala trinket um I was like
[00:08:59] okay he's playing on this religious
[00:09:00] thing this is important to him I don't
[00:09:02] know but it was uncomfortable for me to
[00:09:05] see him get out of the room so much I
[00:09:06] didn't like that I was like what is he
[00:09:08] planning you know and he could have very
[00:09:10] well been talking to the girl saying hey
[00:09:11] just record this and uh try to write it
[00:09:14] out and and get it to me I don't know
[00:09:17] how he would
[00:09:18] have maybe they had some signals
[00:09:22] prepared but I don't know how he would
[00:09:23] have let her know with the door closed
[00:09:25] when to pass through the paper right how
[00:09:28] did she know I was looking the other way
[00:09:30] that kind of thing I mean he was very
[00:09:32] verbal in what he was saying could have
[00:09:34] been heard through the door but you know
[00:09:36] there's a lot of things right to plan
[00:09:38] just saying now one thing I will say is
[00:09:41] I did think it was weird that he talked
[00:09:42] out loud and what's funny is if you were
[00:09:45] to go with the conjecture that the woman
[00:09:47] recorded him and wrote it out based on
[00:09:49] what she heard that makes sense for the
[00:09:51] mistakes that he's made here like for
[00:09:52] example in the first line he says when
[00:09:54] he felt the mountain right this
[00:09:56] translated to when his field the
[00:09:59] mountain when he faed the mountain so
[00:10:04] you know there's things that he would
[00:10:06] have said or pronounced incorrectly that
[00:10:09] got translated kind of actually how it
[00:10:12] was written down which is pretty good
[00:10:14] sign that it was recorded and somebody
[00:10:16] wrote down what they heard now on the
[00:10:18] flip side if you listen to what he says
[00:10:21] and you compare it to what he wrote or
[00:10:23] she wrote some of the words he said are
[00:10:27] missing um or they're different so that
[00:10:31] kind of throws a wrench into that idea
[00:10:32] that she was listening to a recording
[00:10:34] and writing out what she heard because
[00:10:36] how can she write out stuff that isn't
[00:10:38] there unless it's done on purpose to
[00:10:40] give the effect that it's not perfect
[00:10:42] you know what I mean but have a listen
[00:10:45] right sure yeah you do9 yeah this one
[00:10:51] [Music]
[00:10:54] 269 first of all hands instead of he
[00:10:57] wrote this person wrote hand
[00:11:00] if you heard hands like you did there
[00:11:01] you would have written the S no he F the
[00:11:05] mountain SI Underneath Him the wall of
[00:11:09] rocks tring the wall of rocks he says
[00:11:12] right but here it says the wall
[00:11:14] Rock okay of the downhill side of the
[00:11:19] tent was collapsing the tent he said was
[00:11:23] collapsing and that doesn't even show
[00:11:25] here it says of
[00:11:27] washing cry flying or whatever this says
[00:11:30] so of washing where did that come from
[00:11:34] right why would that person have written
[00:11:35] that if it's pretty clear like if you
[00:11:38] didn't see the video and you hearing
[00:11:39] that you wouldn't write of washing right
[00:11:43] I don't know not saying that that's not
[00:11:44] the way they did it um but maybe it's
[00:11:47] more than that maybe it's a little
[00:11:48] different or maybe it's not that exact
[00:11:51] scam right just a different
[00:11:54] scam next let's talk about the paper
[00:11:56] that I rip okay here's what I have to
[00:11:58] say about that uh when I ripped it out
[00:12:01] you can see it's it's not a perfect tear
[00:12:04] right now the pages in this book had a
[00:12:07] perforated Edge right meaning that you
[00:12:09] know it's supposed to be easy to rip in
[00:12:11] a straight line now I don't know my
[00:12:14] nerves or just trying to do it fast
[00:12:16] enough I didn't get it quite so I think
[00:12:18] and I I again I'm trying to remember
[00:12:20] what happened exactly but I think that I
[00:12:22] ripped it into the seam of the book
[00:12:25] right meaning the perforated Edge was
[00:12:27] still there okay now you can see it's
[00:12:30] clearly uneven right but if you look at
[00:12:34] this Frame I'm going to screenshot
[00:12:37] it you can actually see the perforated
[00:12:40] Edge okay now why is that important well
[00:12:43] when he's doing his thing for the 30
[00:12:45] minutes that I'm not looking there's a
[00:12:47] possibility that he evened it out right
[00:12:50] he just pulled the paper off uh so that
[00:12:53] it was perfect there is that possibility
[00:12:55] I'm not going to rule that out I can see
[00:12:57] myself I'm a perfectionist if I saw that
[00:12:59] uneven edge and I was just kind of
[00:13:01] sitting there trying to remember
[00:13:02] something out of boredom I could see
[00:13:04] myself very well um evening out an
[00:13:07] uneven side like that totally reasonable
[00:13:09] again I never saw where did the paper go
[00:13:11] maybe put in this pocket like the the
[00:13:13] shreds that came off the side I don't
[00:13:15] know but I agree this is not the same
[00:13:19] Jagged Edge as the one of the paper that
[00:13:21] I have right there it's perfectly almost
[00:13:26] perfect here right so
[00:13:29] that's interesting also they're talking
[00:13:31] about how I wasn't able to see the
[00:13:32] handwriting he hit it from me that is
[00:13:34] true but I could see he was writing
[00:13:36] something do I know what it was no did
[00:13:39] it look similar to what I got on the
[00:13:41] final paper yes but again I couldn't see
[00:13:44] what it was writing word for word so who
[00:13:46] knows more on the paper issue later I
[00:13:49] have some really damning evidence it
[00:13:51] just made me decide there and then that
[00:13:53] for sure no question this was all a scam
[00:13:59] all right now the next part that is a
[00:14:01] huge problem of course and I knew this
[00:14:03] would be a huge problem for a lot of
[00:14:04] people and I even had a huge problem
[00:14:06] with it of course is that I had to turn
[00:14:09] away I at that moment I was like are you
[00:14:11]  kidding me after all this after
[00:14:15] so much of letting me kind of be in the
[00:14:17] process here you're now going to tell me
[00:14:19] to look away that's going to kill all
[00:14:21] credibility right there and then and it
[00:14:23] did right I mean this is Anything Can
[00:14:25] Happen technically in 20 30 minutes
[00:14:27] without someone looking right
[00:14:29] now what I will tell
[00:14:32] you for the most part I had them in my
[00:14:35] peripheral again we were in this room
[00:14:37] together I also could hear I was being
[00:14:40] very very perceptive any chance I could
[00:14:42] get I was looking at him in my my
[00:14:45] peripheral you can see in the video that
[00:14:47] that's not always the case could she
[00:14:49] have slid something under the door
[00:14:51] definitely would I have heard it yeah
[00:14:53] maybe not you know like I was listening
[00:14:56] I wasn't listening for that right um but
[00:14:59] I do know that the door was never opened
[00:15:00] I can tell you that much because that
[00:15:02] door made sound and he didn't move
[00:15:04] really from where he was sitting
[00:15:08] there so yeah I mean the other question
[00:15:10] is where did the other paper go maybe he
[00:15:12] just folded and put it in his pocket I
[00:15:14] don't
[00:15:15] know so now here's the thing that gives
[00:15:17] away that this is most likely a scam all
[00:15:20] right and it has to do with the paper as
[00:15:22] well if you look at the paper he gives
[00:15:24] me right there's clearly a crease down
[00:15:27] the middle where it was folded and
[00:15:28] actually there was another one this way
[00:15:31] too it was folded in four he gave it to
[00:15:32] me
[00:15:33] okay over a month later those creases
[00:15:37] are still there okay you can see them
[00:15:40] right if I hold them in the light there
[00:15:41] you go you can see them easily now
[00:15:43] notice the corners I don't know if you
[00:15:45] can see this but the
[00:15:47] corners have no noticeable fold creases
[00:15:51] right like when you read a book and you
[00:15:53] Dogg ear the page
[00:15:56] right if you look at
[00:16:00] let's see the original page I gave him
[00:16:04] there's a noticeable Dogg ear at the
[00:16:06] bottom corner that does not exist here
[00:16:10] now the thing about paper when you fold
[00:16:12] it those creases do not come out they
[00:16:14] are there for eternity I mean unless I'm
[00:16:17] wrong right somebody Prov me wrong if
[00:16:19] you make a fold in a paper can you get
[00:16:21] that fold out as if it never happened I
[00:16:24] don't think you can do that in the
[00:16:25] standard you know School A4 piece of
[00:16:28] paper whatever you want to call it
[00:16:30] physicist out there Am I Wrong uh I
[00:16:33] don't care how much you know I've been
[00:16:34] having this paper stuck in this hard
[00:16:37] cover book pressed right so maybe it was
[00:16:40] massaged out you would still see a vague
[00:16:42] line somewhere on the sheet if that was
[00:16:44] the
[00:16:46] case I just want you to watch this all
[00:16:49] right I managed to find a still I
[00:16:53] scrubed through the footage and when he
[00:16:54] was doing the recall writing things out
[00:16:56] on paper and I tried to find a moment
[00:16:59] where he turned the page over and I
[00:17:00] could freeze the frame and sort of read
[00:17:03] maybe what he was writing because
[00:17:04] remember I couldn't see what he was
[00:17:05] writing per I could kind of see and it
[00:17:08] looked like he was writing I saw ink on
[00:17:09] the page but I couldn't tell what it was
[00:17:11] okay but there's this Frame here if you
[00:17:15] I'll play it a couple times so he just
[00:17:18] turned it over to right again he had
[00:17:20] taken a pause so look a little slower
[00:17:22] there flip it over if I stop it right
[00:17:26] here zoom in
[00:17:29] look at that right I draw a little line
[00:17:32] that shows I can't read what it is right
[00:17:34] it's it's still too blurry but I can
[00:17:36] tell for sure with certainty 100% that
[00:17:40] that first word and all looks like most
[00:17:42] of the lines there that he's written so
[00:17:44] far are a decent amount of space away
[00:17:47] from that margin line right shown in red
[00:17:50] here that is undeniable that's it's not
[00:17:52] touching the line right there's like a
[00:17:54] little Gap there am I crazy no this is
[00:17:57] what he gave me
[00:17:59] yeah no Gap
[00:18:07] whatsoever gotcha now if you
[00:18:10] number these lines here's another piece
[00:18:12] of evidence I'm sure you could get a
[00:18:13] bunch out of this but that to me speaks
[00:18:15] for itself there's no need to go further
[00:18:16] it's done it is not the same sheet he
[00:18:19] gave me from the one he's writing on
[00:18:20] right now done and done but if you look
[00:18:22] on line nine here I don't know what that
[00:18:24] word is it looks like he's right he
[00:18:25] wrote something like meaning or becoming
[00:18:29] it ends in ing I can see the g at the
[00:18:31] end there now if we look at the same
[00:18:33] line on the thing he gave me that word
[00:18:36] does not look the same as the other one
[00:18:38] and even the G the way he's written the
[00:18:40] G is not the same kind of loow hanging
[00:18:43] hook right it's a different kind of loop
[00:18:45] so no matter what you want to believe
[00:18:48] you can't deny that it's over BJ it's
[00:18:50] over you're done stop this crap man you
[00:18:54] wasted my time I'm so angry I'm really
[00:18:57] angry I felt for the guy I was too nice
[00:19:00] I do that story of my life but I was too
[00:19:02] nice and this guy uh well he he shot
[00:19:05] himself in the foot to be honest but um
[00:19:08] there it is BJ is a scam artist and a
[00:19:11] fraud Nelson Dallas four-time USA memory
[00:19:13] Champion says
[00:19:15] so now one last thing I want to talk
[00:19:18] about is his handwriting at this point I
[00:19:21] don't really know if it matters to even
[00:19:23] talk about this but it is interesting
[00:19:24] nevertheless because it still makes me
[00:19:26] wonder how he did this again I don't
[00:19:28] think it's it's as simple as he made the
[00:19:30] girl do it and she was recording there's
[00:19:32] some inconsistencies with that but this
[00:19:34] definitely was a scam after I realized
[00:19:37] that you guys were right and that maybe
[00:19:39] someone else wrote this I reached out to
[00:19:41] him immediately on Facebook to see if he
[00:19:43] would do something on camera I recorded
[00:19:45] it had him write out a passage that's
[00:19:48] the same from here made him take a
[00:19:50] picture of it live on the call so I
[00:19:52] could compare the handwritings and this
[00:19:53] is what I got these are the two
[00:19:55] handwriting samples they look the same
[00:19:58] but someone else one of you guys uh
[00:20:00] actually reached out to me with
[00:20:02] handwriting samples from other previous
[00:20:05] uh demos he's done and it doesn't look
[00:20:07] the same at all his handwriting has
[00:20:09] changed now there could be explanations
[00:20:11] for this sometimes people's handwritings
[00:20:13] change but if this is the girl that
[00:20:17] wrote it how can it be the same as what
[00:20:19] he just demonstrated for me did they
[00:20:21] train to match their handwritings I
[00:20:24] don't know maybe that's not too hard um
[00:20:27] but it is something to think about right
[00:20:29] how do they do
[00:20:30] that in the end it doesn't matter BJ is
[00:20:33] a fraud I'm saying that definitively no
[00:20:36] more videos about this I'm moving on as
[00:20:38] all of you should forget this clown and
[00:20:40] just move on he's not worth anybody's
[00:20:42] time Nepal is a beautiful country and
[00:20:44] doesn't deserve to be made a fool of by
[00:20:47] this one guy anyways that's it no more
[00:20:51] I'm done this is the last video
[00:20:54] Promise anyways I hope you like my
[00:20:57] content as I said before it'll be more
[00:20:59] memory related helpful in the future
[00:21:02] because believe it or not these memory
[00:21:04] techniques are not Divine Powers anybody
[00:21:06] can do that yep it's true so please like
[00:21:10] And subscribe please share and uh I'll
[00:21:13] see you guys in the next video I'm out
[00:21:17] [Music]


=== I interviewed Bijay Shahi... ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMKgCaYDklU

[00:00:00] all right guys here it is
[00:00:03] i've been talking about this for almost
[00:00:04] a year now
[00:00:06] bj
[00:00:13] i interviewed him i happened to be in
[00:00:16] nepal
[00:00:16] and no i did not fly out there for the
[00:00:19] sole purpose of interviewing him i was
[00:00:20] actually there
[00:00:22] climbing everest for seven weeks and it
[00:00:24] just so happened that my flight was
[00:00:26] delayed i had a lot of time
[00:00:27] we had the resources to meet each other
[00:00:30] even
[00:00:31] through a pandemic and lockdown and he
[00:00:33] kept
[00:00:34] messaging me on facebook saying when can
[00:00:37] we meet
[00:00:38] when can we do this interview i never
[00:00:40] for the life of me thought that he would
[00:00:42] reply
[00:00:43] after i saw the last set of videos of
[00:00:46] him
[00:00:47] being ousted being discovered seen as a
[00:00:50] fraud
[00:00:51] [Music]
[00:00:54] i thought that was it thought it was a
[00:00:55] done deal why would he want to be
[00:00:57] interviewed by me
[00:00:58] i want to make him look like a fool so
[00:01:01] his eagerness
[00:01:02] i had the time let's do it i did offer
[00:01:05] it
[00:01:06] bj i invite you to my channel let's do
[00:01:08] an interview the videos that
[00:01:10] he put out the interviews that he's done
[00:01:12] the demonstrations that he's done
[00:01:14] have deserved a lot of the criticism
[00:01:16] that
[00:01:17] i and much of nepal and the world have
[00:01:19] given him
[00:01:20] i do think it's his fault that
[00:01:24] people have given him that criticism
[00:01:25] because
[00:01:27] he hasn't explained much he hasn't shown
[00:01:28] much of what he does and
[00:01:30] people don't like that i don't like that
[00:01:32] i'm a very logical
[00:01:33] reasonable person and if somebody does
[00:01:36] something that seems
[00:01:37] out of the ordinary you need to give me
[00:01:39] more
[00:01:40] you need to explain more otherwise
[00:01:42] people are going to
[00:01:44] discredit you and say that you're a
[00:01:46] phony so
[00:01:47] that's where we are he was persistent
[00:01:50] and again
[00:01:51] i decided to meet with him so the way
[00:01:52] this worked i was on everest for seven
[00:01:54] weeks he kept texting me
[00:01:55] on uh facebook i thought it was someone
[00:01:58] else i've been reached out by so many
[00:01:59] people claiming to be
[00:02:00] bj shahi saying they want to talk to me
[00:02:03] whatever
[00:02:04] and all of them have been fake so i was
[00:02:06] very cautious but this seemed to be the
[00:02:08] real guy
[00:02:09] but he said hey when are you done with
[00:02:10] the mountain let's meet and i said
[00:02:12] listen i don't know if i'll have time
[00:02:13] i'm
[00:02:14] flying home to my family immediately
[00:02:16] i've been on the mountain long enough so
[00:02:17] i don't know if this is gonna happen but
[00:02:19] there was a lockdown in nepal and
[00:02:21] kathmandu the
[00:02:22] there were no flights going out so i was
[00:02:23] actually in kathmandu for a week
[00:02:25] and even though there was lockdown he
[00:02:27] was able to secure
[00:02:29] the government officials to help us see
[00:02:31] each other across town
[00:02:32] which was very impressive he went
[00:02:34] through great lengths
[00:02:36] to see me or to make sure that our
[00:02:38] interview happened
[00:02:39] why well i would assume he wants to use
[00:02:42] my platform to
[00:02:44] get something straight he had something
[00:02:46] to show me to tell me
[00:02:48] that might change my mind or anybody
[00:02:50] else's mind who watches my channel or
[00:02:52] all of nepal rather because at this
[00:02:54] point i think
[00:02:56] people have put them out and that's fine
[00:02:58] like i said totally justified or mostly
[00:03:00] justified in my eyes
[00:03:01] but hey i'm a nice guy i'm an open guy i
[00:03:04] want to give people a shot
[00:03:05] maybe i'm wrong this is what i offered
[00:03:07] in the beginning is prove me wrong
[00:03:09] so he invited me to his office um he had
[00:03:12] a
[00:03:13] um you'll see him in the video there was
[00:03:16] a guy with him who was basically his
[00:03:19] manager maybe it's hard there's a lot of
[00:03:21] uh
[00:03:22] things lost in translation but he helped
[00:03:24] kind of translate things and
[00:03:26] i think he was teaching him english as
[00:03:28] well um
[00:03:29] and then there was also a government
[00:03:30] official who was driving us around
[00:03:33] making sure that we could get around
[00:03:34] safely and legally despite the lockdown
[00:03:38] and what you're about to see is the hour
[00:03:40] and a half
[00:03:41] interview that we had i'm gonna probably
[00:03:44] speed up certain sections or leave stuff
[00:03:46] out just for the sake of
[00:03:48] this video but i will link the full
[00:03:51] entire uncut video in the description so
[00:03:55] you can watch if you really want to sit
[00:03:56] there for an hour and a half and
[00:03:58] scrutinize every little thing that
[00:03:59] happened in the video i tried my best
[00:04:01] to cover every angle to cover every
[00:04:03] sound and not
[00:04:04] cut anything so that you could see what
[00:04:06] you see
[00:04:07] and my goal of this video is not to
[00:04:09] convince you of anything new
[00:04:12] not to change your mind i'm just
[00:04:14] presenting what happened to me
[00:04:16] when i went to visit bj shahi and you
[00:04:19] guys can decide for yourself
[00:04:21] i'll give you a little bit of what i
[00:04:22] think at the end and through this video
[00:04:24] but ultimately i'm not putting anything
[00:04:26] in anybody's mind
[00:04:28] definitively that is up to you if you
[00:04:30] want to hate him
[00:04:31] hate him if you want to give him a
[00:04:33] chance give him a chance if you need
[00:04:35] more from him to decide
[00:04:37] then that's the way it is oh one more
[00:04:39] thing since this is about
[00:04:41] memory techniques and learnable
[00:04:43] techniques versus
[00:04:44] innate gifts for memorization
[00:04:47] let's talk about my memory course which
[00:04:49] is available for the next few days only
[00:04:52] for this cohort i'm opening it up until
[00:04:54] the end of the week and you can sign up
[00:04:55] for the course
[00:04:56] be a part of this cohort and actually
[00:04:58] learn the techniques that will help you
[00:05:00] do
[00:05:00] some of the things or all of the things
[00:05:02] that memory champions can do
[00:05:04] if you're watching this later and the
[00:05:06] course is closed you can always
[00:05:07] register for the course so that you get
[00:05:09] notified
[00:05:11] on a waitlist when i reopen the course
[00:05:14] and you can join then
[00:05:15] back to the video wait i need
[00:05:18] a book let's let's just talk first so
[00:05:24] so first thing that happened you know we
[00:05:26] got into
[00:05:27] this office it was very empty it was
[00:05:29] basically had two chairs and a desk
[00:05:31] nothing was in the room i was very
[00:05:34] vigilant looking for cameras or
[00:05:36] i don't know recording devices there was
[00:05:38] nothing literally an
[00:05:40] empty building and he was keen to dive
[00:05:42] right in
[00:05:43] to memorizing a book i think that's what
[00:05:45] he had in his mind that i was going to
[00:05:47] ask him to do
[00:05:48] i had other things in mind but you know
[00:05:50] i wanted to get to know him first and
[00:05:52] one thing i should note is that his
[00:05:53] english is not very good i don't think
[00:05:56] his english was horrible
[00:05:57] but you'll notice that there is some
[00:05:58] miscommunication or
[00:06:00] struggling with understanding what i'm
[00:06:02] saying and he defers to his
[00:06:04] manager to help translate things this
[00:06:06] isn't about his english this is about
[00:06:07] his memory okay
[00:06:09] so if any of you are out there gonna
[00:06:10] bash his english
[00:06:12] shame on you i mean who cares granted he
[00:06:14] could memorize
[00:06:15] how to learn english and i would imagine
[00:06:17] he's gonna work on his english
[00:06:19] but at this point in time his english
[00:06:20] was not that great and don't give him a
[00:06:22] hard time for it
[00:06:23] mine that belief sucks is non-existent
[00:06:25] actually so
[00:06:26] there you have it for those that don't
[00:06:29] know
[00:06:30] this is bj shahi from default the memory
[00:06:34] king
[00:06:35] i've talked about him a lot on my
[00:06:37] youtube channels
[00:06:38] and i'm in depaul and he wanted to meet
[00:06:40] me i asked him for an interview and he
[00:06:42] here he is so we're going to talk to him
[00:06:46] test him and see what he's about try to
[00:06:49] understand him a little more
[00:06:50] and uh see what his skills are like
[00:06:53] so thank you thank you um how old are
[00:06:57] you
[00:06:58] uh i am 20 years old 20 years old
[00:07:02] and where are you from i am from
[00:07:04] california
[00:07:05] this is the west of nepal i've done very
[00:07:07] poor
[00:07:10] and i was born very far
[00:07:14] you do poor small
[00:07:17] village okay and um
[00:07:20] when did you start to memorize
[00:07:24] when did you realize you had good memory
[00:07:31] everything is based on divine power
[00:07:36] okay this was kind of the first weird
[00:07:38] real instance that
[00:07:39] um feels off to me
[00:07:42] but as you'll see later maybe it makes
[00:07:44] sense
[00:07:46] for this culture or people from um this
[00:07:49] area of the world who believe
[00:07:50] in certain religions okay let's keep it
[00:07:53] at that
[00:07:55] he's about to tell me that the gift that
[00:07:59] bj has is a divine power meaning
[00:08:03] he was born with it meaning it's
[00:08:06] something that god chose specifically
[00:08:09] for
[00:08:10] bj no one else to me that seems like a
[00:08:12] very easy way to just brush things
[00:08:14] under the rug right how can you do this
[00:08:16] well god
[00:08:17] made me that way okay um
[00:08:21] what we'll find out later is that he did
[00:08:22] work on this he did realize that he had
[00:08:24] a gift and that he practiced a lot
[00:08:29] and that he actually uses techniques as
[00:08:31] well
[00:08:32] i don't quite know what that means we'll
[00:08:34] see later but he has a divine power
[00:08:36] i as a usa memory champion do not uh
[00:08:39] with the blessing of
[00:08:42] god is khalid
[00:08:47] he got this power so you're saying he
[00:08:49] was born with this power
[00:08:52] a divine power divine goddess
[00:08:57] okay so so me
[00:09:00] no divine power no i
[00:09:03] [Music]
[00:09:04] wish because i because i was not born
[00:09:07] with it
[00:09:08] it has been selected out of
[00:09:12] quarter to eight billion people's of the
[00:09:14] earth yeah
[00:09:16] by the goddess i didn't get he didn't
[00:09:18] get
[00:09:20] 75
[00:09:22] [Music]
[00:09:24] so first of all
[00:09:28] uh this nepal
[00:09:31] is the place of
[00:09:34] god and god you can start seeing that
[00:09:36] i'm a bit
[00:09:37] annoyed by this this is not what i want
[00:09:39] to hear anyways i'm going to skip a bit
[00:09:41] here because
[00:09:42] uh we're here to look at bj not uh his
[00:09:45] uh
[00:09:45] sidekick when did you realize
[00:09:55] [Music]
[00:10:01] for me to read the books okay and end
[00:10:06] eight one thirty minutes to memorize the
[00:10:09] books
[00:10:10] okay so what he's saying here to read
[00:10:12] any book
[00:10:13] or memorize any book takes him 20
[00:10:15] minutes whether it's
[00:10:16] page uh 10 pages a thousand pages
[00:10:20] 20 minutes and then one hour and 30
[00:10:23] minutes
[00:10:23] to he says memorize but i think what he
[00:10:26] means is to recall
[00:10:27] the information that he's trying to get
[00:10:28] out interesting
[00:10:30] doesn't make sense to me right if you
[00:10:32] have one page 10 pages a thousand pages
[00:10:34] there's more and more information on
[00:10:36] each of those
[00:10:37] sizes of pages so how can it be the
[00:10:39] exact same time that doesn't make any
[00:10:41] sense from a mathematical
[00:10:43] physics perspective right but this is
[00:10:45] what he's saying
[00:10:46] okay at two years old i'm two years two
[00:10:49] years
[00:10:50] okay in nepalese nepalese
[00:10:53] yeah okay i have it i have
[00:10:57] i have practice very
[00:11:07] okay so you mix the two together divine
[00:11:10] power
[00:11:10] and technique yeah
[00:11:36] [Music]
[00:11:44] [Music]
[00:11:53] you understand otherwise
[00:12:05] [Music]
[00:12:11] so he's saying you know he meditates a
[00:12:13] long time from two years old he was
[00:12:15] practicing this divine power he invented
[00:12:18] his own memory techniques that
[00:12:20] uh i guess sit on top of this divine
[00:12:23] power and help
[00:12:24] enhance or control this power that he's
[00:12:27] been given
[00:12:28] right he makes a big point throughout
[00:12:29] this conversation that meditation and
[00:12:32] yoga or what i understand to be yoga as
[00:12:35] a very integral part of the whole
[00:12:36] process
[00:12:37] you can see here i'm like what the hell
[00:12:39] is going on all right so
[00:12:40] let's let's can we try can you close the
[00:12:43] door
[00:12:44] can i give you a book yeah are we trying
[00:12:48] yeah pl please don't rip the page okay
[00:12:50] i'm gonna go fast
[00:12:53] okay so i had a book
[00:12:56] that um i had just bought before my
[00:12:59] everest expedition
[00:13:00] not with the intention to show it to him
[00:13:02] but for me to read it was a book about
[00:13:04] everest i actually have it over here
[00:13:05] i'll get it in a moment
[00:13:06] but um i thought okay it was just
[00:13:08] published it's in english there's no way
[00:13:11] um no bookstores are open in kathmandu
[00:13:14] at the moment because they're on
[00:13:15] lockdown
[00:13:15] there's no way he could have seen this
[00:13:17] book or gotten this book
[00:13:18] so it seemed like a great book to use so
[00:13:20] i'm about to get that
[00:13:22] now i'm i think he's at this point
[00:13:24] expecting to
[00:13:25] memorize the whole book like he has in
[00:13:26] all his videos but
[00:13:29] first of all i don't have the time i was
[00:13:31] very
[00:13:32] strapped for time uh this day but i also
[00:13:35] wanted to
[00:13:36] just start simple right i mean if you
[00:13:39] can do a full
[00:13:39] book then you should be able to do a
[00:13:41] single page and a single page
[00:13:43] is pretty tough right i mean you could
[00:13:46] take your time and memorize it anybody
[00:13:48] could do that but to do it fast
[00:13:50] is very hard word for word right it's
[00:13:53] still
[00:13:53] you know a bunch of bunch of words a lot
[00:13:55] of text and in english
[00:13:57] right notice how bad as english is like
[00:13:59] imagine to memorize something in a
[00:14:01] language that you're
[00:14:03] basic at very basic that's got to be
[00:14:05] tough so i choose a random page
[00:14:08] give it to him and let him go
[00:14:12] so this is a book that i just read it
[00:14:14] just came out in english
[00:14:18] so how does this work
[00:14:21] [Music]
[00:14:24] okay you can
[00:14:28] take about 20 minutes uh read the book
[00:14:32] all right to memorize uh 1 30
[00:14:35] uh 130 to memorize the book
[00:14:38] to reach that means you know
[00:14:41] within 20 minutes you'll
[00:14:52] [Music]
[00:14:55] okay and later on
[00:15:10] so i don't want to take a whole hour or
[00:15:12] 20 minutes
[00:15:13] so maybe i could choose 20 minutes
[00:15:17] read off book one book okay let's
[00:15:20] why don't we start with just one page
[00:15:22] one fish
[00:15:23] just one page i show i choose one page
[00:15:25] one for one field or one paragraph i
[00:15:27] think
[00:15:28] one face
[00:15:31] 25 minutes memorized one fits okay
[00:15:35] no no one page as fast as you can do it
[00:15:38] given
[00:15:38] one face okay yeah just to save time
[00:15:43] is that okay one page okay one pitch
[00:15:46] okay this this is simple
[00:15:49] we start simple that's okay
[00:15:52] it's still very impressive for me if i
[00:15:54] look at one page
[00:15:56] it takes me maybe an hour one fish
[00:15:58] technique
[00:15:59] all right so a few things here to catch
[00:16:01] up on he wanted to memorize the entire
[00:16:03] book in 20 minutes
[00:16:04] meaning looking through it in 20 minutes
[00:16:06] using his divine power
[00:16:07] and then an hour and a half to recall
[00:16:11] you know i wasn't clear if he'd have to
[00:16:12] spend an hour and a half just thinking
[00:16:14] about the book or
[00:16:15] if after the memorization i'd say hey
[00:16:17] paige
[00:16:18] 25 and he needed an hour and a half to
[00:16:20] extract it
[00:16:21] right but either way i said listen i'm
[00:16:23] not interested let's do
[00:16:25] one page to start okay i'll choose one
[00:16:28] page at random
[00:16:29] you do it as fast as you can okay and
[00:16:31] what he was saying i think is he was
[00:16:33] just going to read through the page and
[00:16:34] then take about 20 to 30 minutes
[00:16:37] to recall it to get it out
[00:16:40] okay but what's interesting is he said
[00:16:42] technique meaning he's going to do this
[00:16:44] with technique
[00:16:46] which i was never given a clear answer
[00:16:48] as to what the difference is between
[00:16:50] when he's doing it divinely
[00:16:53] with his divine power or with his
[00:16:55] technique
[00:16:56] i was actually never told what the
[00:16:57] technique is unfortunately
[00:16:59] even though i asked but whatever let's
[00:17:01] watch him he's at this point gonna ask
[00:17:03] me to basically frisk him
[00:17:05] uh to make sure that he has no devices
[00:17:07] no cell phone no recording devices he
[00:17:09] takes off his jacket
[00:17:11] i pat him down granted i didn't want to
[00:17:13] be too invasive but
[00:17:14] i will tell you that there was nothing
[00:17:16] in this room
[00:17:18] nothing okay the two gentlemen there
[00:17:21] were in the room um but there was no
[00:17:24] communication
[00:17:25] nothing that listen i'm not an idiot
[00:17:28] sure i
[00:17:28] i can be deceived by a magician or an
[00:17:30] illusionist
[00:17:31] sure but i was very aware of where i was
[00:17:36] and um to the best of my knowledge
[00:17:39] okay and i've seen a lot of of memory
[00:17:42] hoaxes and and and shams i know what to
[00:17:45] look for so
[00:17:46] um i was very aware of what was going on
[00:17:48] there was nothing on him his cell phone
[00:17:50] and uh was off um and i actually he
[00:17:53] gives it to me and it's by my side
[00:17:55] so there's really nothing that could
[00:17:56] have been communicated um
[00:18:00] i think it would have been very
[00:18:00] difficult uh very very difficult so
[00:18:04] um you'll see you can check my whole
[00:18:07] body my body
[00:18:08] take my photo i take my they take my
[00:18:11] mobile
[00:18:12] app
[00:18:41] okay so this page 269 here
[00:18:48] so what is it
[00:19:04] [Music]
[00:19:22] oh
[00:19:27] he's never seen this book before i it's
[00:19:30] just printed
[00:19:31] uh i'm choosing a random page honestly
[00:19:34] um
[00:19:35] yeah okay this page pretty good yeah
[00:19:45] sure yeah yeah this one 269.
[00:19:48] we don't put it together without
[00:19:59] so now he's reading the page i didn't
[00:20:01] expect him to do this i was expecting
[00:20:03] him to do his crazy
[00:20:05] screaming that he does the the talking
[00:20:08] in tongues but
[00:20:10] maybe this is part of the technique
[00:20:11] method but he's reading
[00:20:13] the words on the page and you can notice
[00:20:16] that
[00:20:17] he's not saying the words perfectly but
[00:20:19] he's basically just
[00:20:20] reading it once through there's no
[00:20:23] repeat or review
[00:20:24] and it's in a language that he doesn't
[00:20:25] really know so this is impressive
[00:20:27] if this is gonna work
[00:20:30] after rolling about 100
[00:21:13] so at this point this is super
[00:21:15] interesting to me because
[00:21:17] he's saying here that this is technique
[00:21:19] now all he did was
[00:21:20] read out loud which means as he's saying
[00:21:22] the word
[00:21:23] and moving on to the next one he's
[00:21:25] processing the information and
[00:21:26] remembering it memorizing it storing it
[00:21:29] whatever his process
[00:21:30] is i don't know what that little
[00:21:32] outburst was at the end
[00:21:33] maybe it's part of the process god
[00:21:35] speaking to him
[00:21:36] i don't know seems unnecessary seems
[00:21:38] like
[00:21:39] if i did that suddenly when i was
[00:21:41] memorizing it wouldn't help me at all
[00:21:42] but what's interesting here is he's just
[00:21:45] talking right
[00:21:46] so it's not even that he needs to
[00:21:47] suddenly review oftentimes when i
[00:21:49] memorize something really fast
[00:21:51] i need a moment i put the information
[00:21:54] away but i need a moment to consolidate
[00:21:56] everything that i just stored really
[00:21:57] quickly
[00:21:58] he's not doing that here which is pretty
[00:22:00] impressive
[00:22:01] sometimes during my memorization
[00:22:04] if i do the consolidation while
[00:22:06] memorizing which can happen a bit slower
[00:22:09] i can do what he's doing start talking
[00:22:11] normally if you see me memorize a deck
[00:22:12] of cards on chris ramsay's channel
[00:22:14] he was impressed that i could keep
[00:22:15] talking about it before i actually
[00:22:17] recalled it and that's kind of similar
[00:22:19] here although
[00:22:21] i don't know how you read something live
[00:22:23] once through and then immediately
[00:22:25] um start to talk right without
[00:22:27] consolidating it would be slipping away
[00:22:29] and again the information is in the book
[00:22:32] his manager doesn't have it
[00:22:33] you know i read the book but i don't
[00:22:34] have it the guy out the corner there the
[00:22:37] government official doesn't have it and
[00:22:38] he
[00:22:39] just read through it once and it's in
[00:22:41] his head right
[00:22:42] that's what he's claiming just like that
[00:22:45] it's all in there
[00:22:46] that seems a bit of a stretch for me but
[00:22:47] let's see what happens
[00:22:49] if you give this book the
[00:22:53] pronunciation divine power is different
[00:22:55] okay
[00:22:56] so this is the only kidney okay
[00:22:59] otherwise
[00:22:59] if you read through divine power it's
[00:23:02] fascinating
[00:23:02] yeah different different techniques oh
[00:23:05] this is the formula
[00:23:10] okay that's fine let's start with this
[00:23:12] page so they're just explaining here
[00:23:14] that if he had used his divine power
[00:23:16] this is where he would have been a lot
[00:23:17] faster he would have done the whole
[00:23:19] screaming and shouting thing but here he
[00:23:22] was using his formula
[00:23:23] his divine power i don't know why he
[00:23:25] just didn't use the divine power
[00:23:27] if he could do it faster does it make
[00:23:28] sense to me but maybe it's like
[00:23:31] if we're gonna give him a little bit of
[00:23:33] credit here
[00:23:34] in his his universe of religious
[00:23:37] abilities
[00:23:38] that maybe you know it's a power that
[00:23:40] you can't always use or
[00:23:42] there's um you know you don't want to
[00:23:44] call on
[00:23:45] uh your god to provide this power too
[00:23:48] often
[00:23:48] i don't know that still sounds
[00:23:51] absolutely absurd to me but
[00:23:52] whatever the point we're looking for
[00:23:54] here is can he memorize what he says he
[00:23:56] can memorize
[00:23:57] um and is it impressive and do we
[00:23:59] believe him right
[00:24:01] however he wants to explain it in the
[00:24:03] end fine
[00:24:04] uh i guess what can we do but um i want
[00:24:08] to
[00:24:08] know if what he's doing is actually real
[00:24:11] or if it's
[00:24:11] fake can i can i see the phone
[00:24:15] one yeah this one yeah okay
[00:24:19] can you turn it off no chat
[00:24:23] oh it's off yeah okay just so that
[00:24:26] you're not recording
[00:24:27] you're funny maybe for me yes
[00:24:31] okay so now sticky no no i believe i did
[00:24:34] it again
[00:24:36] yeah pockets yeah nothing yeah yeah okay
[00:24:39] okay
[00:24:40] so now now what uh memorize
[00:24:44] 30 minutes
[00:24:49] so you go over it in your head
[00:24:53] [Music]
[00:24:56] so now is where he's i guess going
[00:24:58] through his information
[00:25:00] consolidating it speaking in
[00:25:03] tongues whatever this is to communicate
[00:25:05] with this god
[00:25:06] i don't know this all this this
[00:25:08] religious stuff really
[00:25:11] doesn't sit straight with me but again
[00:25:13] i'll address that later but this is what
[00:25:15] he's doing
[00:25:16] i'm being as respectful as possible just
[00:25:18] to let him do his thing now just to
[00:25:20] remind you no one else has seen the page
[00:25:21] that i showed him
[00:25:23] so you know if the guys on the side were
[00:25:25] trying to relay information through
[00:25:27] blinking or gestures or whatever
[00:25:30] it would have been impossible nobody had
[00:25:33] this book
[00:25:33] nobody knew the page or saw the page
[00:25:36] other than him
[00:25:37] and i guess myself
[00:25:54] yeah i don't have any but i'll inspect
[00:25:57] whatever they did
[00:26:20] one page
[00:26:28] this is from uh a notebook listen i've
[00:26:31] never seen this book this page is blank
[00:26:33] there's no markings on it
[00:26:50] after 30 it's 30 minutes
[00:26:54] all 30 minutes not now
[00:26:57] okay
[00:26:59] [Music]
[00:27:05] why do you have to write it down
[00:27:10] [Music]
[00:27:12] why on paper why can't you say it why
[00:27:15] can't you say it
[00:27:19] if you know it no no permit not
[00:27:22] permit by the divine you should sit down
[00:27:24] here right
[00:27:26] now can you type it on a phone
[00:27:30] right down here can you
[00:27:43] [Music]
[00:27:44] at this point i actually re-watching
[00:27:46] this feel kind of bad that
[00:27:49] i was interrupting him one thing i hate
[00:27:51] is when i'm trying to
[00:27:52] consolidate information is being
[00:27:53] interrupted i have to focus
[00:27:55] um i don't know what i was thinking here
[00:27:58] i'm
[00:27:59] maybe purposefully trying to throw him
[00:28:00] off a little bit
[00:28:02] but he clearly is focusing on something
[00:28:05] and
[00:28:05] and working through some information in
[00:28:07] his head so i shouldn't have
[00:28:08] uh been interrupting here he will do in
[00:28:11] contracting news
[00:28:12] he will do in front of you not
[00:28:23] so yeah i'm being a bit obnoxious here
[00:28:25] um but what
[00:28:26] bothers me is he in all those
[00:28:28] demonstrations he's writing out the
[00:28:30] answer
[00:28:31] on paper why why can't if you know it
[00:28:34] you know it so
[00:28:35] say it you can you know paint it with a
[00:28:38] brush on the wall
[00:28:39] you could type it in a text message to
[00:28:41] someone
[00:28:42] um you could say it out loud so why does
[00:28:45] it have to be written
[00:28:46] and his answer i forget if it's here or
[00:28:49] later is basically
[00:28:51] this is the way that the god is
[00:28:54] giving him the information that's it
[00:29:10] okay
[00:29:24] hook
[00:29:27] that's fine you can use this he's going
[00:29:28] to write on the back of this again this
[00:29:29] has no correlation to the book that i
[00:29:33] so at this point he's literally writing
[00:29:35] out apparently
[00:29:36] the page that i had to memorize uh word
[00:29:39] for word
[00:29:40] and i could see that he was a little
[00:29:42] uncomfortable with me filming him with
[00:29:44] everybody watching
[00:29:45] i think in a lot of his demonstrations
[00:29:46] he does it off to the side
[00:29:49] um you know that's a little suspect but
[00:29:52] i appreciated that he let me film this
[00:29:55] and kind of hover over him but what was
[00:29:58] interesting he would not let me
[00:30:00] you know in the middle take the paper
[00:30:03] and examine it
[00:30:04] i could see out of the corner of my eye
[00:30:07] that he was
[00:30:08] writing actual words and there was no
[00:30:12] modification made anywhere
[00:30:15] from this point until he gives it to me
[00:30:17] it's what he's writing
[00:30:19] okay um his explanation later
[00:30:22] for this is that uh the process wasn't
[00:30:25] complete
[00:30:26] it's a divine power and divide and
[00:30:28] process so
[00:30:29] um it needs to be completed um it's
[00:30:31] god's word
[00:30:32] going through him so to share the
[00:30:34] incomplete message
[00:30:36] or have me intervene uh is not allowed
[00:30:39] so let's fast forward a little bit here
[00:30:42] it's just him writing
[00:30:43] again if you want to see the details you
[00:30:44] can watch the full version
[00:30:46] in the description so at this point
[00:30:50] you know his demeanor has changed a
[00:30:52] little bit he's gotten a little more
[00:30:53] stressed a little more serious
[00:30:54] um he's written a lot down i'd say three
[00:30:57] quarters of the entire
[00:30:58] text i don't know for sure because i
[00:30:59] can't uh read it yet
[00:31:01] um but at this point he's clearly trying
[00:31:04] to
[00:31:05] get something out of him that he's
[00:31:06] forgotten or that's not as well
[00:31:08] memorized
[00:31:09] um but suddenly after all this talk you
[00:31:12] know
[00:31:12] for the last number of minutes he wants
[00:31:15] me to
[00:31:16] move to the other part of the room and
[00:31:18] for me to not film him
[00:31:20] and to not look i don't like that
[00:31:24] right obviously the whole point of this
[00:31:26] is to show
[00:31:27] as clear as possible what is happening
[00:31:31] i didn't really have much of a choice
[00:31:32] you can see i tried to kind of keep the
[00:31:34] camera on him
[00:31:35] i could still see him out of my
[00:31:36] peripheral vision i'll tell you that
[00:31:38] much
[00:31:38] he did not touch anything he did not
[00:31:40] access anything he was where he was
[00:31:42] sitting in his yoga pose
[00:31:44] with his hands like this sometimes
[00:31:45] waving them crazy in the air and doing
[00:31:47] this gibberish
[00:31:48] um talking in tongues thing
[00:31:51] what i would guess is that you know he
[00:31:54] really believes this is some divine
[00:31:56] power and that this process
[00:31:58] is god speaking to him i'm not
[00:32:00] comfortable with that but
[00:32:02] again i'm not a religious person so i
[00:32:04] could understand
[00:32:05] how someone from a very religious part
[00:32:08] of the world
[00:32:09] might really interpret you know in the
[00:32:12] same way that i forget something and
[00:32:14] then suddenly it comes to me
[00:32:16] i just say hey my brain started working
[00:32:17] or i just remembered it
[00:32:19] that's the way it is but maybe someone
[00:32:21] might interpret that as god
[00:32:23] speaking to me the answer right it came
[00:32:25] from somewhere
[00:32:26] but maybe it came from high above right
[00:32:29] um i don't believe it again but
[00:32:31] i could see how somebody who's very
[00:32:33] devout and religious and who thinks they
[00:32:34] have a special gift like this from
[00:32:36] god uh could think that right maybe
[00:32:39] i'm really giving him the benefit of the
[00:32:40] doubt here but i will say
[00:32:43] aside from us having to look away i can
[00:32:46] confirm
[00:32:47] that nothing was he didn't reach for the
[00:32:50] book i could see the book the whole time
[00:32:52] there was no other way he was getting
[00:32:54] that information from anywhere
[00:32:56] other than the gibberish that he was
[00:32:58] saying but this goes
[00:32:59] on a long time i'm going to speed it up
[00:33:01] but it went on for like 30 40 minutes
[00:33:04] which begs the question okay how
[00:33:06] practical
[00:33:07] is this in reality right to memorize
[00:33:09] something
[00:33:11] suddenly he like freaks out uh i guess
[00:33:13] it's kind of like equivalent to oh i got
[00:33:15] it i got it i found
[00:33:16] the thing i've been trying to remember
[00:33:18] and he's asking me for
[00:33:20] something to write on uh he still had
[00:33:21] the paper in the pen but i guess he
[00:33:23] wanted a surface to write on which i had
[00:33:24] taken that book away from him
[00:33:29] so this point he's done right uh i have
[00:33:32] the book he has the writing that he
[00:33:33] wrote
[00:33:35] and i try my best to show the part of
[00:33:37] the book
[00:33:38] that he recalled i don't quite follow
[00:33:40] along
[00:33:41] because as you'll notice his english is
[00:33:43] not great so i
[00:33:44] can't quite follow exactly what he's
[00:33:46] reading and it's not exactly perfect
[00:34:04] of the downhill tide of the tent
[00:34:07] or washing crank crying uh surprising
[00:34:11] the tent
[00:34:12] read looks on it is the extra
[00:34:15] can wheel down the mountain for the
[00:34:18] second

[00:35:37] meet
[00:35:38] that phone did not shine the same they
[00:35:40] have been a thought but it bought

[00:35:53] chinese in the short one moment
[00:36:01] [Music]
[00:36:13] [Music]
[00:36:24] um
[00:36:37] [Music]
[00:36:46] okay so let's pause there was that
[00:36:48] impressive to you maybe you couldn't
[00:36:50] really tell
[00:36:51] i have the same book he gave me the
[00:36:54] sheet
[00:36:54] that he recalled on so what i might do
[00:36:58] is actually provide a scan of
[00:37:01] both right so that'll be in the
[00:37:03] description so you can compare
[00:37:05] the actual printed page and the actual
[00:37:08] written page by bj himself
[00:37:10] okay and you tell me or you decide for
[00:37:14] yourself if you think
[00:37:15] that is impressive to look at something
[00:37:17] by reading it one time through like he
[00:37:19] did
[00:37:20] then take you know 30 to 45 minutes to
[00:37:24] pull it out of your brain and write it
[00:37:25] out and then have something that's
[00:37:28] not a hundred percent but i'd say
[00:37:32] i personally was impressed
[00:37:35] you know but you can decide for yourself
[00:37:38] but what i'll tell you
[00:37:39] is and i made this comment to a few
[00:37:42] other memory people that i've talked to
[00:37:43] is
[00:37:44] if we're talking about you look at
[00:37:45] something memorize it and then
[00:37:48] regurgitate it let's measure the time to
[00:37:51] do that
[00:37:52] i could have done this faster i wouldn't
[00:37:55] have been able to memorize it as fast as
[00:37:57] him i
[00:37:57] couldn't have done it in one reading
[00:37:59] like that and i would have been able to
[00:38:00] say it out loud while memorizing i would
[00:38:02] have had to
[00:38:03] use my memory palace go through it a
[00:38:05] bunch of times but maybe within 15
[00:38:07] minutes
[00:38:08] i could memorize it maybe 20 minutes
[00:38:11] then to recall it would be instant right
[00:38:14] i would just start writing it down
[00:38:15] and yeah sure there'd be parts that i
[00:38:17] maybe miss or or or need to think of
[00:38:19] longer to remember
[00:38:21] but i'd i'd be done you know total
[00:38:24] maybe in 30 to 40 minutes right um here
[00:38:27] you know he took what five minutes to
[00:38:29] read the page maybe less
[00:38:30] and then 45 or longer minutes
[00:38:34] to recall it and write it down so
[00:38:38] what are we talking about here right is
[00:38:39] it practicality of these techniques in
[00:38:41] which case
[00:38:42] this isn't very practical at all when
[00:38:44] are you going to be able to look at
[00:38:45] something fast and then have
[00:38:47] all the time in the world to write it
[00:38:49] out like this
[00:38:50] and it's not even clear to me that now
[00:38:52] that he's gotten it
[00:38:53] out what if you have to do it again is
[00:38:56] it a whole
[00:38:56] 45 minute process again or you know
[00:39:00] is it now on top of mind and i think the
[00:39:02] answer is it's not he'd have to use the
[00:39:04] whole process again so
[00:39:05] how's that even good for you know
[00:39:07] studying for a class or
[00:39:09] or learning something new you know
[00:39:11] whereas on my side
[00:39:12] i memorized it slower but recalled it
[00:39:15] faster and
[00:39:16] it's with me as long as i want if i
[00:39:18] review it more i'll keep it forever
[00:39:19] right so there's that one second
[00:39:27] just so you guys uh know here is the
[00:39:29] book the third poll
[00:39:30] i didn't have the cover on it i actually
[00:39:32] left that
[00:39:35] out but this is the exact same book um
[00:39:38] page 369 i have it
[00:39:40] marked here with bj's paper himself
[00:39:44] so i will scan this put it in the
[00:39:47] descriptions
[00:39:48] and again here's the front page here's
[00:39:50] the back page
[00:39:52] you can decide um what you think of it
[00:39:57] son very nice thank you thank you sir
[00:40:00] so let's talk a little bit
[00:40:06] can i see that am i allowed to look
[00:40:10] [Music]
[00:40:17] this was interesting i really wanted to
[00:40:19] keep the paper um
[00:40:20] just obviously so that i can examine it
[00:40:23] later and really go through it but i
[00:40:25] always found it interesting that he had
[00:40:26] to
[00:40:27] almost bless it right he said something
[00:40:29] in his gibberish
[00:40:30] speaking in tongues thing i think he
[00:40:32] really believes right that this is a
[00:40:34] divine power i can't take that belief
[00:40:36] away from him
[00:40:38] and to give me that piece of paper
[00:40:40] probably was
[00:40:41] against most things that he believes
[00:40:44] through this power
[00:40:45] so i really appreciated that he gave it
[00:40:46] to me in good faith
[00:40:48] but it was interesting to see him kind
[00:40:49] of say this quick little whatever that
[00:40:52] was if that's legit or an act uh i don't
[00:40:55] know
[00:40:55] anyways so the next part of this video
[00:40:57] is about a 30-minute stretch of
[00:41:00] purely interview questions um i
[00:41:03] apologize
[00:41:04] that there's some translation issues he
[00:41:07] doesn't speak very good english
[00:41:08] so he may not have understood me in
[00:41:10] certain points but i tried my best
[00:41:12] and i'm not going to interject any more
[00:41:14] in this video you guys can just watch
[00:41:16] this
[00:41:17] and make what you want of it there were
[00:41:19] a lot of answers that come up that
[00:41:20] did not sit well with me i didn't really
[00:41:23] go into it i didn't want to be
[00:41:25] debating or combatant i just kind of let
[00:41:27] him
[00:41:28] say his answers and moved on but again
[00:41:30] please understand that
[00:41:32] there was a lot that i did not like
[00:41:35] about this next part
[00:41:36] that did not satisfy me that i thought
[00:41:38] were bs but i just kind of wanted to get
[00:41:40] on with the interview and let him speak
[00:41:42] his words
[00:41:43] ultimately you judge for yourself here
[00:41:45] we go
[00:41:48] close the book and then here it is
[00:41:51] right yes on the other hand there's a
[00:41:54] long time
[00:41:56] but divine power but but not very
[00:41:59] practical
[00:42:00] delivered because for me
[00:42:03] i think i could do the same thing maybe
[00:42:06] faster
[00:42:07] with just techniques no divine power
[00:42:10] finish that's my divine power books
[00:42:14] one
[00:42:32] you know what that means i don't believe
[00:42:35] in god no god
[00:42:36] me oh man so when i see you do that
[00:42:39] i don't understand you know it doesn't
[00:42:42] make sense
[00:42:43] to me so i am very practice yeah
[00:42:47] now um calm down
[00:42:53] so you wrote maybe up to here
[00:42:56] right and then you stopped
[00:43:00] and you said is that to help you
[00:43:03] remember
[00:43:04] not even much what you miss yeah okay
[00:43:07] that's
[00:43:07] got it okay and then technique yeah with
[00:43:10] the technique but the divine power
[00:43:12] brings you the rest and then you
[00:43:15] remember it
[00:43:16] and you write it all down okay got it um
[00:43:21] so uh can you sure
[00:43:24] i want your help to prove to the
[00:43:28] old about my skill sir yeah i listen i i
[00:43:32] make this video
[00:43:33] to make it as people can decide
[00:43:37] i know that there was a moment where i
[00:43:39] was not allowed to look
[00:43:41] but there's nothing else in this room
[00:43:44] so and there's no way he would have
[00:43:46] accessed this book before
[00:43:47] so you guys make the call
[00:43:51] i'm convinced that it's a mixture of
[00:43:54] what i do and some inner belief that
[00:43:58] uh he has this power which i do too but
[00:44:01] not divine
[00:44:02] um let me ask you do you
[00:44:05] only do books
[00:44:15] [Music]
[00:44:20] one
[00:44:26] but let me ask you what uh what page
[00:44:30] was the number 269 269 okay
[00:44:34] what was the last word off
[00:44:43] yeah the first word okay
[00:44:46] can you say um the first
[00:44:50] word of the third paragraph um
[00:45:00] now can you you you wrote it down
[00:45:05] but can you can you say it say it
[00:45:11] the first first two sentences writing
[00:45:14] why
[00:45:15] because this year divine power
[00:45:18] and uh and need to follow what's going
[00:45:21] say
[00:45:22] cheer really but if he tells you to
[00:45:25] write
[00:45:26] writing can't you say as you write
[00:45:28] divine power
[00:45:30] but debate power not follow
[00:45:34] it's not allowed not out not a lot
[00:45:36] interesting
[00:45:37] okay
[00:45:41] you dash
[00:45:44] ready
[00:46:10] yeah at the memory competition oh yeah
[00:46:13] we do this
[00:46:13] very fast
[00:46:18] oh yeah i mean they've seen it all i can
[00:46:21] do for you but
[00:46:22] um can you do this the same but with
[00:46:25] cards
[00:46:27] father different you cannot do it
[00:46:31] no no no but
[00:46:36] because if you cannot
[00:46:39] if you can read english
[00:46:43] you can read chinese nepalese and
[00:46:46] memorize the book
[00:46:47] yeah so why not a card a number and a
[00:46:50] suit
[00:46:50] no chinese s is the same
[00:46:54] chinese is very hard chinese
[00:46:58] doesn't make sense is it like another
[00:47:00] language this is like another language
[00:47:10] [Music]
[00:47:20] [Music]
[00:47:22] arabic
[00:47:31] no you could not
[00:47:35] your pronunciation
[00:47:39] [Music]
[00:47:44] these are letters in chinese maybe you
[00:47:47] don't understand
[00:47:48] but you see the symbols you memorize
[00:47:50] those you can't
[00:47:55] [Music]
[00:48:03] okay and can you try
[00:48:06] try to memorize try uh
[00:48:11] six cards
[00:48:17] practice before
[00:48:33] this is to show people that you're human
[00:48:38] that is good people believe you more i
[00:48:40] think if they know that
[00:48:42] you can't memorize everything
[00:48:45] so i want to know i believe you have a
[00:48:48] power
[00:48:49] i think that's incredible but i want to
[00:48:51] see how it translates
[00:48:52] to other things numbers cards
[00:48:57] pictures is it good is it bad do you
[00:49:02] do you understand no not allowed they
[00:49:05] went by
[00:49:07] so okay okay but then that's how he
[00:49:10] couldn't
[00:49:11] understand whatever you are telling yeah
[00:49:14] uh just
[00:49:14] once teach you him then he will try
[00:49:18] okay first teach him how to do this
[00:49:22] okay um i will um
[00:49:27] one more thing numbers can you do
[00:49:30] numbers one two three four
[00:49:32] hundred how big yeah
[00:49:35] big one one thousand dollars
[00:49:38] so if i write can i
[00:49:41] right yeah
[00:50:07] but this is one two three four five six
[00:50:09] seven eight nine ten
[00:50:20] [Music]
[00:50:24] okay same time okay so
[00:50:27] how is that useful in real life
[00:50:34] if someone gives you a phone number call
[00:50:37] me

[00:51:49] okay you can read this whole book in 20
[00:51:51] minutes
[00:51:52] as fast as you did one day this workbook
[00:51:54] in 20 minutes
[00:51:56] and uh it will take one and a half hour
[00:51:58] to memorize
[00:51:59] then you can ask him anything from this
[00:52:02] book he can
[00:52:12] [Music]
[00:52:17] one two books yeah but he can do it

[00:52:26] how to do that
[00:52:44] [Music]
[00:52:58] yeah and also divine power
[00:53:02] i meditate long time okay one
[00:53:05] more 14 days
[00:53:09] non-stop wow okay i study 18 hours per
[00:53:12] day
[00:53:13] yeah per day right i
[00:53:16] finally i found the
[00:53:19] technique yeah and this
[00:53:23] can also be
[00:53:26] taught to others the technique yeah if
[00:53:29] they follow
[00:53:29] that's what i teach i teach techniques
[00:53:36] what's the technique technicality
[00:53:39] technique four uh forward step four
[00:53:42] steps four steps
[00:53:44] first step first step path motion
[00:53:47] first step okay yeah second step reading
[00:53:52] three hours reading second step
[00:53:54] furnishing writing yeah
[00:53:56] uh three steps are converted convert
[00:54:00] b for statement formula and technique
[00:54:03] yeah and perfect uh dollar
[00:54:06] one minute uh one minute is uh 300 words
[00:54:10] memorize you gotta get it okay so
[00:54:13] my technique if i were to to do this
[00:54:17] 269
[00:54:19] [Applause]
[00:54:22] i use a memory palace you know memory
[00:54:24] pals
[00:54:25] do you know i think of um
[00:54:28] [Music]
[00:54:29] a house or office
[00:54:33] a building place and i imagine
[00:54:37] pictures for each word or to pick [ __ ]
[00:54:41] on what
[00:54:41] yeah and then i put it in the memory
[00:54:43] palace
[00:54:45] so with a bottle and his hands
[00:54:48] i think of a bottle in his hands in my
[00:54:52] bedroom to my house
[00:54:55] in my bed right and then
[00:54:58] when he felt the mountain so i think of
[00:55:02] feeling the mountain but i put it in my
[00:55:04] bathroom
[00:55:07] so when i remember i go to my bedroom
[00:55:10] the bottle i go to my bathroom i feel
[00:55:13] the mountain
[00:55:15] is it like is that the technique you use
[00:55:17] no no no picture no
[00:55:19] different this is different different
[00:55:21] techniques
[00:55:23] or to convert to pictures okay so
[00:55:26] why don't you a lot of people have
[00:55:28] questions
[00:55:29] how do you do it you say formula but
[00:55:31] then you don't say the formula so people
[00:55:35] question they say what is the formula
[00:55:38] you're cheating
[00:55:42] if i i tell everyone my formula i say
[00:55:45] it's easy
[00:55:46] because
[00:55:50] [Music]
[00:55:59] 25 25
[00:56:10] the formulas come from divine power
[00:56:13] or you make them
[00:56:21] [Music]
[00:56:28] your students she has no divine power no
[00:56:31] no no no
[00:56:32] technique technique definitely
[00:56:40] [Music]
[00:56:49] because i practice words in one minute
[00:56:53] 15 years almost
[00:56:58] one minute me i practiced three two
[00:57:00] years
[00:57:01] yeah yeah so i practice a lot my best
[00:57:05] is um in one minute
[00:57:09] i can do maybe uh
[00:57:12] let's see maybe 60
[00:57:15] 70 words yeah
[00:57:18] the best in the world the memory
[00:57:21] champion
[00:57:22] world memory champion maybe can do 80.
[00:57:26] that's the best and you say you could do
[00:57:29] 200 300.
[00:57:34] in one minute
[00:57:36] [Music]
[00:57:37] let's take 150 150. that's amazing
[00:57:40] that's double
[00:57:42] the best and nobody else in the world
[00:57:45] but you can do that i'm not i'm not
[00:57:50] i haven't seen it give me your legs
[00:57:56] [Music]

[00:58:59] i otherwise
[00:59:02] without going yeah can i ask you a
[00:59:05] question

[01:09:44] questions i'm very intrigued very
[01:09:46] impressed
[01:09:47] um i think there's a lot
[01:09:50] we can learn from him and uh maybe give
[01:09:53] him a shot
[01:09:55] to explain himself a little more i think
[01:09:58] i need to analyze this a little more but
[01:10:00] i'm very happy that you met with me and
[01:10:02] i've been very kind nothing here felt
[01:10:06] uh fake uh some things were a little out
[01:10:09] of the ordinary that i'm not used to but
[01:10:10] that's a different culture for me
[01:10:12] um so thank you for watching and um
[01:10:17] hopefully we can maybe bring you to the
[01:10:18] united states
[01:10:20] and try to show you to the world
[01:10:24] i'd love to try to help you okay you
[01:10:26] should get permission
[01:10:28] i didn't do
[01:10:29] [Music]
[01:10:42] you have to
[01:10:49] [Music]
[01:10:57] yeah yeah with the memory okay okay
[01:11:00] all right thank you man thank you so
[01:11:01] much
[01:11:04] so there you have it what do you think
[01:11:07] please let me know what you think in the
[01:11:08] description
[01:11:09] now listen be fair i understand that
[01:11:12] uh there have been a lot of
[01:11:14] presentations by him that have been
[01:11:16] questionable and i still don't know if i
[01:11:19] believe them
[01:11:20] um you know i can't i wasn't there
[01:11:23] um they look very suspect but what i can
[01:11:26] say
[01:11:27] is what he did for me here i believe in
[01:11:31] okay now i've seen people do
[01:11:35] things like this before that are legit
[01:11:38] so it wasn't crazy impressive
[01:11:42] right um other than he looked at it once
[01:11:45] by
[01:11:45] talking through the page once i think
[01:11:47] that's very difficult to do
[01:11:49] and then he didn't see it any more than
[01:11:52] that but an hour later he's
[01:11:53] had it all written down you know there
[01:11:55] were some weird things
[01:11:57] happening in the room but not things
[01:11:59] that were gonna lead me to question the
[01:12:01] validity of his actual
[01:12:03] test there do i really believe the
[01:12:06] religious thing
[01:12:07] no do i believe that he believes it sure
[01:12:10] does he have a gift i think so to some
[01:12:14] extent
[01:12:14] right is it what i saw in other videos
[01:12:19] maybe not quite again i didn't test him
[01:12:21] with a full book
[01:12:22] right like in the other videos so i
[01:12:24] can't say to that
[01:12:26] i was a bit um let down that he wouldn't
[01:12:29] even attempt to memorize
[01:12:31] a deck of cards or numbers for that
[01:12:34] matter
[01:12:35] like what's the difference right if you
[01:12:37] have a book with especially in a foreign
[01:12:39] language that you don't really speak
[01:12:40] which is a bunch of just random symbols
[01:12:42] words in english
[01:12:44] why can't you do that with cards right
[01:12:45] if i lay them out in order why can't you
[01:12:47] do that with numbers
[01:12:49] his excuse was that he had never
[01:12:51] practiced it or that the divine power
[01:12:53] doesn't work like that how convenient
[01:12:55] right
[01:12:56] what can i say to that other than okay i
[01:12:59] guess you're not doing that today
[01:13:01] right again all i can say is what i saw
[01:13:04] and personally i was there if you want
[01:13:07] to believe me
[01:13:08] four-time memory champ who knows this
[01:13:10] world who's
[01:13:12] you know i'd say a logical person
[01:13:14] reasonable very
[01:13:16] um methodical and how he thinks and
[01:13:19] and processes things if you want to
[01:13:21] believe me for what i saw what i
[01:13:23] experienced and what i tried to control
[01:13:24] as best as possible in that room
[01:13:26] um then you have to admit that he has
[01:13:29] some skill
[01:13:31] he's not a phony or at least completely
[01:13:34] phony
[01:13:35] i think he does have something um i
[01:13:37] would have liked to see more and maybe
[01:13:39] i'll get a chance to
[01:13:40] to really test him on um bigger
[01:13:43] uh things like a book like he says he
[01:13:45] can but uh
[01:13:47] but yeah i almost walked away with this
[01:13:49] not really knowing what to think
[01:13:51] anymore other than i saw what i saw and
[01:13:53] that was
[01:13:54] legit um beyond that i can't really say
[01:13:58] but i would say that maybe people are
[01:14:01] being a bit harsh on him
[01:14:02] um and to maybe give him a chance i will
[01:14:05] admit that i think he hasn't gone about
[01:14:07] exposing himself in the right way um and
[01:14:10] that there would have been
[01:14:11] better ways to help make his reception a
[01:14:15] little easier
[01:14:16] let's say it like that and with regards
[01:14:18] to the event where he was
[01:14:19] proven to be fake i could believe this
[01:14:23] too he was saying that people are out to
[01:14:24] get him people don't like his sudden
[01:14:26] fame and people are out to discredit him
[01:14:28] i get that there are people all around
[01:14:30] the world who will try to undermine you
[01:14:32] especially for things that they don't
[01:14:34] understand
[01:14:35] right like memory abilities like this
[01:14:38] nobody's done that to me but again i'm
[01:14:40] not claiming to have divine powers i'm
[01:14:42] not claiming to do
[01:14:43] really incredible things like he can i
[01:14:45] can do kind of cool things but
[01:14:47] they're not like beyond the realm of
[01:14:51] of thought right some of his stuff kind
[01:14:53] of is
[01:14:54] so i can see how people would want to
[01:14:56] take that away um
[01:14:57] from him not to say that they did but i
[01:15:00] could understand that and he was saying
[01:15:01] that the papers that they found with the
[01:15:03] indentations on them were planted
[01:15:08] we'll never know right um but there it
[01:15:11] is
[01:15:11] this is the interview with bj shahi
[01:15:15] um listen he was very nice
[01:15:18] very welcoming um you wouldn't expect
[01:15:20] that from someone who's a fraud
[01:15:22] who is not wanting to be exposed he was
[01:15:25] more than
[01:15:26] happy to welcome me in very friendly
[01:15:29] very excited to meet me even after i
[01:15:32] made those
[01:15:32] two videos where i kind of talked a bit
[01:15:35] of smack about him so
[01:15:37] um you know he's a young kid and
[01:15:40] i think if he plays it right he could
[01:15:42] have
[01:15:43] a good future in in teaching others how
[01:15:45] to improve their memory
[01:15:47] i just think he needs to be a little
[01:15:50] more open
[01:15:51] uh with how he does things because i
[01:15:53] walked away with this still not knowing
[01:15:55] what his techniques are unfortunately
[01:15:57] and we tried to kind of share
[01:15:58] like he's some memory palace thing and
[01:16:01] he didn't really know
[01:16:02] what i was talking about but again it
[01:16:04] could have been lost in translation
[01:16:06] anyways i'll let you guys decide thanks
[01:16:08] for watching i know i've been teasing
[01:16:10] this video for a long time so i
[01:16:11] appreciate you
[01:16:12] letting me make a longer video for this
[01:16:13] channel and uh it'll be back to
[01:16:17] more uh fun lighthearted stuff in the
[01:16:19] next video if you like this video please
[01:16:21] like subscribe and share
[01:16:23] i'll see you in the next one thanks for
[01:16:24] watching i'm out

=== memorize THIS on MOUNT EVEREST?? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f6Lw21ZIhE

[00:00:00] this video is sponsored by mind lab pro
[00:00:02] more about them in the middle of the
[00:00:03] video
[00:00:04] welcome to mount everest
[00:00:08] my name is nelson dallas i'm a four-time
[00:00:10] usa memory champion and this year i am
[00:00:12] actually on mount everest making
[00:00:14] an attempt to summit the dang thing it's
[00:00:17] my fourth attempt i've tried this over
[00:00:19] the past 10 years it's been a dream of
[00:00:20] mine since
[00:00:22] good god i don't know 2009 or something
[00:00:24] like that so here i am
[00:00:26] usually i do like a base camp tour which
[00:00:28] is always very interesting i think to
[00:00:29] see what it's like to live here
[00:00:31] at 17 300 feet
[00:00:35] but i figured to make it more
[00:00:37] interesting for you guys
[00:00:38] let's actually use the tour and the
[00:00:40] places in which i live on a day-to-day
[00:00:42] basis
[00:00:43] as a memory palace to memorize something
[00:00:44] cool now i'm not going to tell you what
[00:00:46] that cool thing is until the end of the
[00:00:47] video
[00:00:47] but just play along follow me through
[00:00:50] our little camp here
[00:00:51] and i'll tell you different points along
[00:00:53] this memory palace
[00:00:54] if you don't know what memory palace is
[00:00:56] shame on you go watch my other videos
[00:00:58] right now and then what we're going to
[00:00:59] do
[00:01:00] is place a weird image on each location
[00:01:02] and that'll help you remember the order
[00:01:04] of the thing
[00:01:05] that i'm trying to get you to memorize
[00:01:06] now at the end of this video i'll even
[00:01:08] show you a more advanced version of this
[00:01:10] to add more info
[00:01:11] to what we already memorized so you can
[00:01:13] look even cooler when somebody asks you
[00:01:15] about the thing that i'm trying to get
[00:01:17] you to memorize so without any further
[00:01:19] ado let's go
[00:01:28] all right so here we go our first
[00:01:29] location is my wonderful abode
[00:01:32] my apartment for the recent past four
[00:01:34] weeks in the next two to four weeks this
[00:01:36] is base camp this is my
[00:01:38] tent so this is the first location and
[00:01:40] what i want you guys to picture here
[00:01:42] right where i'm standing sitting is
[00:01:45] mount everest
[00:01:45] itself imagine that on this rinky dink
[00:01:49] mattress that i have is a pretty cool
[00:01:52] scale model
[00:01:53] of mount everest right here that's it i
[00:01:56] know it's not super crazy but imagine if
[00:01:58] you had a real
[00:01:59] kind of miniaturized everest plopped
[00:02:01] right in the middle of your tent
[00:02:03] that'd be a pain in the butt to sleep
[00:02:04] around right yeah
[00:02:06] cool all right let's get out of the tent
[00:02:08] now this is a whole bit of a mission but
[00:02:09] let's do it
[00:02:13] [Music]
[00:02:16] [Applause]
[00:02:17] [Music]
[00:02:20] all right so our second location is
[00:02:22] going to be this platform kind of
[00:02:23] outside of my tent
[00:02:24] maybe this rock you can focus on but our
[00:02:27] next image is going to be a
[00:02:29] dog a canine dog you know like the
[00:02:32] police dogs
[00:02:33] german shepherd except he's got two legs
[00:02:36] that's it
[00:02:37] so it's a canine with two legs and he's
[00:02:40] just sunbathing here
[00:02:42] he's got nowhere to go he's got two legs
[00:02:44] he's just chilling there
[00:02:45] that's it all right next over here
[00:02:50] this is my climbing buddy's tent here
[00:02:53] his name is dante
[00:02:54] you can see his foot right there but
[00:02:55] this platform area will be our third
[00:02:57] location
[00:02:59] and what we're gonna imagine here is
[00:03:01] seeing
[00:03:02] jackie chan
[00:03:06] but he's playing jenga he's got a
[00:03:08] massive jenga set here and he's
[00:03:09] carefully pulling blocks out and the
[00:03:12] question you ask yourself as you watch
[00:03:13] this weird display
[00:03:15] is can chan
[00:03:18] jenga all right can he play jenga
[00:03:22] i don't know all right next from this
[00:03:25] platform
[00:03:26] go by my tent over here there's one more
[00:03:29] tent up there that's another person on
[00:03:31] our team she's kind of high up there all
[00:03:34] right so
[00:03:34] from her tent that's our next location
[00:03:37] for i want you to imagine that from
[00:03:39] there
[00:03:40] it's such a beautiful vantage point that
[00:03:41] there's there's just lots to see
[00:03:44] get up there you can see all this
[00:03:46] amazingness
[00:03:47] see all that i mean there literally is
[00:03:52] lots to see that's our image
[00:03:55] all right let's keep moving our next
[00:03:58] location
[00:04:00] is kind of down these stairs not really
[00:04:03] stairs but it's a little pathway
[00:04:06] maybe halfway down right here
[00:04:09] on this little pathway oh i'm out of
[00:04:12] breath
[00:04:14] we have a guy making
[00:04:17] a loo like a toilet a british toilet
[00:04:20] making a loo
[00:04:21] right here it's a bit pressurish is
[00:04:23] maybe getting some of the rocks around
[00:04:25] some of the ice and carving it
[00:04:27] into a loo making a loo
[00:04:31] all right let's keep going
[00:04:36] i'm gonna eat it alright next we have
[00:04:38] this tent right here
[00:04:39] this is for toilet business
[00:04:43] oh okay
[00:04:47] jesus am i ready to climb this thing or
[00:04:51] what
[00:04:51] all right so here this kind of staging
[00:04:53] area right here will be our sixth
[00:04:55] location
[00:04:57] and the next image i want you to imagine
[00:04:58] is that there's a little guy here who
[00:05:00] just kind of stands guard
[00:05:01] and all he does is say let me show you
[00:05:04] let me show you let me show you let me
[00:05:05] show you let's just show you around he's
[00:05:07] a really helpful guy but he says it in a
[00:05:08] really choppy accent so he's saying let
[00:05:10] me cho
[00:05:11] you let me show you
[00:05:15] all right continuing on we go into the
[00:05:18] actual
[00:05:21] toilet tent right here very glamorous
[00:05:24] just basically a bin
[00:05:25] with the seat on it anyways our image on
[00:05:28] this toilet
[00:05:29] is a doll it's a doll named gary
[00:05:33] just sitting on the toilet here taking
[00:05:35] care of business sorry gary
[00:05:37] i'll get out of your hair then right
[00:05:39] next door
[00:05:41] we have a little shower area nothing
[00:05:44] crazy just a little mat here
[00:05:46] but basically we get a bucket of water
[00:05:48] pour it on ourselves and that's our
[00:05:49] shower
[00:05:50] our next image is a man who flew
[00:05:54] so there's just a little man zipping
[00:05:55] around flying here taking a shower
[00:05:58] and i say wow that's a man who flew
[00:05:59] manoflu
[00:06:01] okay all right another helicopter
[00:06:04] another rescue out of this tent now
[00:06:08] oops
[00:06:10] [Music]
[00:06:12] down these little steps our next
[00:06:14] location here
[00:06:15] is this wonderful puja kind of altar
[00:06:18] which is what they used to kind of
[00:06:20] venerate the
[00:06:22] the mountain and the climb ahead anyways
[00:06:24] the image we're going to put here
[00:06:26] it's kind of weird but it's a mango
[00:06:28] little fruit
[00:06:29] on there and somebody's playing golf
[00:06:31] with it
[00:06:32] trying to get par with a bat so they
[00:06:35] don't have a golf
[00:06:37] club it's a bat so they're playing
[00:06:39] there's a mango
[00:06:40] par with a bat i know it's a weird one
[00:06:43] but try to imagine that
[00:06:44] on this surface there say hi this is
[00:06:47] annie right there mad dog one of our
[00:06:49] sherpas
[00:06:50] jam boo one of our kitchen guys
[00:06:54] all right next location
[00:06:57] going into the this is the kitchen now
[00:07:02] lots of stoves it's hot there's dr zhang
[00:07:05] over there preparing lunch
[00:07:06] here's the problem there's a lady there
[00:07:07] her name is anna kournikova famous
[00:07:09] tennis player
[00:07:10] and she's burning she touched the stove
[00:07:12] so it's
[00:07:13] anna burning ouch so our next location
[00:07:15] is this dining table here this is where
[00:07:17] the sherpas eat
[00:07:19] play cards drink have fun whatever and
[00:07:22] our image i want you to imagine taking a
[00:07:23] broom
[00:07:24] and gashing this table in half so it's a
[00:07:27] gash
[00:07:28] made by a broom that's it
[00:07:31] let's go back out thank you guys
[00:07:34] now let's go into the dining tent here
[00:07:38] this is where we eat and do
[00:07:42] basically nothing but here's our next
[00:07:43] location this little hand washing
[00:07:45] very important during covet times for
[00:07:47] our next image here all i want you to
[00:07:49] picture is a loaf of bread
[00:07:50] that's it we'll open bread anyways let's
[00:07:52] keep going so here our next location
[00:07:55] is this other dining table which is for
[00:07:58] us
[00:07:58] climbers and it's a bigger table but
[00:08:01] same image as the other table in the
[00:08:03] sherpa tent we are gonna imagine taking
[00:08:05] a broom and
[00:08:06] slicing or gashing this table in half
[00:08:09] so a gash with a broom and then finally
[00:08:14] come back out here
[00:08:17] if you see down there that's our lonely
[00:08:20] peeing tent
[00:08:22] where our leader phil crampton is
[00:08:24] actually headed i think
[00:08:26] okay but anyways imagine our last image
[00:08:28] there
[00:08:29] this is a complicated one but imagine
[00:08:30] eating some cheese that gives you a
[00:08:32] stomachache
[00:08:33] you get a pang in your stomach and you
[00:08:36] yell for your mother
[00:08:37] ma so it's cheese pang
[00:08:40] ma right and of course you're gonna go
[00:08:43] to the peeing tent
[00:08:44] well you'll do more than pee in there
[00:08:46] but you're gonna kind of suffer in there
[00:08:48] with that cheese pang
[00:08:49] and cry out for your mom that's it
[00:08:52] that's
[00:08:52] our 14 locations now let's go back to my
[00:08:54] tent and figure out
[00:08:56] what the hell that all means just wanted
[00:08:59] to pause this video for a second to talk
[00:09:00] about
[00:09:01] the sponsor of today's video which is
[00:09:03] mind lab pro
[00:09:04] now i partnered with these guys for the
[00:09:06] next year really excited i don't choose
[00:09:08] my partners
[00:09:10] so flippantly i do my research and i
[00:09:12] only pair with products that actually
[00:09:14] make sense for me in my life so
[00:09:16] this is a universal nootropic it helps
[00:09:18] me kind of stay sharp and
[00:09:20] out here on everest that is crucial
[00:09:22] every step i take
[00:09:24] needs to be the best decision i can make
[00:09:26] is it going to cost me my life am i
[00:09:28] going to fall
[00:09:28] i need to be on top of my game and so
[00:09:30] this stuff has really been helpful to
[00:09:32] keep me
[00:09:33] my memory my sharpness my acuity on
[00:09:36] point throughout this expedition
[00:09:37] if you just want that little bit of edge
[00:09:39] this minelab pro dietary supplement that
[00:09:41] i take
[00:09:42] is awesome i love it and i'm really
[00:09:44] enjoying it right now
[00:09:45] back to the tutorial oh it's
[00:09:48] hot in here geez it's cold outside
[00:09:52] freezing in here hot in here
[00:09:55] what am i saying altitude all right so
[00:09:57] we did 14 locations
[00:09:59] now all of those were absolutely bonkers
[00:10:02] whatever they were
[00:10:03] right but they actually represented the
[00:10:05] 14 highest
[00:10:07] peaks in the world how fitting right
[00:10:10] here we are the highest peak in the
[00:10:11] world i just tell you with the highest
[00:10:14] place in the world
[00:10:14] all the 14 highest places in the world
[00:10:17] nice
[00:10:18] now why 14 well there are four
[00:10:21] can i catch my breath y14 well there are
[00:10:25] 14 peaks in the world that are higher
[00:10:27] than 8 000 meters these are the 14
[00:10:29] highest peaks in the world
[00:10:31] and they all exist in the himalayan
[00:10:33] range on the borders of china
[00:10:34] nepal pakistan india and it's kind of
[00:10:37] this famous thing you know for
[00:10:38] mountaineers you can climb
[00:10:39] all 14 8 000 meter peaks it's a grand
[00:10:42] achievement
[00:10:43] i have only worked on this one so so
[00:10:46] let's recap what we have
[00:10:47] in my tent we had everest which is the
[00:10:50] first one
[00:10:51] it's everest then we went outside my
[00:10:52] tent right there and we had
[00:10:54] a canine dog with two legs that's k2
[00:10:57] then we went to my friend dante's little
[00:10:59] tent platform an image we had there was
[00:11:01] jackie chan
[00:11:02] playing jenga remember the question you
[00:11:04] asked yourself was can
[00:11:06] chan jenga and that's the name of the
[00:11:08] peak kanchenjunga then we went to my
[00:11:10] other teammates
[00:11:11] platform there with her tent up there
[00:11:13] and we had this image of
[00:11:15] a lot to see and the peak is named lotsy
[00:11:18] lotzi i wouldn't say lotsy but you can
[00:11:21] at least use that to get you
[00:11:23] lotsy then we went down this little
[00:11:24] pathway kind of like a staircase not
[00:11:26] really just a bunch of ice and rocks
[00:11:28] but we had the next image was a guy
[00:11:31] making a loo
[00:11:32] a toilet make a loo and that's the name
[00:11:35] of the next peak
[00:11:35] make a loo or makalu then we went to the
[00:11:38] bathroom tent and
[00:11:39] inside as we walked into that kind of
[00:11:40] staging area was
[00:11:42] cho you show you some guy was showing
[00:11:45] you around i was right
[00:11:46] and that's the next peek cho you kind of
[00:11:48] a funny name cho
[00:11:50] you that's literally how you say it then
[00:11:51] in the same tent there was two
[00:11:53] compartments there was
[00:11:54] the one on the left which was the
[00:11:55] bathroom the actual drum
[00:11:57] bin toilet seat we had an image of a
[00:12:00] doll named gary
[00:12:01] doll gary dolla gary that's the name of
[00:12:04] the peak dollar geary
[00:12:06] then we switched over to the shower area
[00:12:07] which was right next to it there we had
[00:12:09] this man who flew man of flu man who
[00:12:13] flew
[00:12:13] the name of the peak is man of slu but
[00:12:15] hopefully that's enough to help you
[00:12:16] remember the name of the peak
[00:12:17] then we went down the stairs further to
[00:12:19] the puja over there that little
[00:12:20] kind of shrine with the flags on it and
[00:12:23] all the little
[00:12:24] juniper burning and stuff like that and
[00:12:26] there we had that weird image of
[00:12:28] a mango someone playing golf for par
[00:12:32] but using a bat so mango par
[00:12:35] bat and the name of the peak is nanga
[00:12:37] parbat
[00:12:38] i know it's close but not quite but
[00:12:40] hopefully you get it close enough
[00:12:42] listen if you get these names wrong
[00:12:43] that's okay they're difficult
[00:12:45] tibetan slash sherpa chinese names so
[00:12:49] they're not supposed to be pronounced
[00:12:51] fluently if you get them close enough
[00:12:53] people will still be impressed then we
[00:12:55] walked into the kitchen where the sherpa
[00:12:57] cook that we have who's amazing dapa
[00:12:59] sang cooks all our meals
[00:13:01] and right there in his little staging
[00:13:02] area we had
[00:13:04] anna kournikova on fire she was burning
[00:13:06] anna berna and the peak is annapurna
[00:13:09] the 10th highest peak in the world then
[00:13:12] we moved to the
[00:13:13] little table in the back there where the
[00:13:14] sherpas have their dinner play cards
[00:13:16] drink whatever they do
[00:13:17] we had an image of gashing that table in
[00:13:19] half with a broomstick
[00:13:21] right and actually the name of the peak
[00:13:22] is gasher broom gas or broom
[00:13:25] and that's the gather broom one then we
[00:13:27] went to the other side to
[00:13:28] our tent our dining tent and we started
[00:13:30] the hand washing station
[00:13:31] and the next peak or the image that we
[00:13:33] had there was a loaf of bread
[00:13:36] bread sounds like broad and that peak is
[00:13:38] broad peak
[00:13:39] then we went to the dining table itself
[00:13:42] and on there we also had
[00:13:43] a gash with a broom and that's gasher
[00:13:46] broom two
[00:13:47] and then finally our 14th peak was down
[00:13:49] by the p
[00:13:50] temps and there is our final peak and
[00:13:52] it's shisha pangma
[00:13:54] this one's entirely into that and the
[00:13:56] image we had was someone saying
[00:13:58] oh this cheese gave me a pang in my
[00:14:01] stomach and i'm
[00:14:02] crying out for my mom because i'm in
[00:14:04] pain so she's shipping
[00:14:06] ma shishman
[00:14:08] [Music]
[00:14:09] there you go all 14 peaks stored around
[00:14:12] this
[00:14:13] tiny little cool little base camp on
[00:14:15] everest in 2021
[00:14:16] wow all right now bring it in for a
[00:14:18] little bit here this last part is a
[00:14:20] little more advanced and only useful if
[00:14:22] you're familiar with the major system
[00:14:24] i've done videos on it
[00:14:25] check them out i'll have links but
[00:14:27] basically it's how to convert numbers
[00:14:28] into pictures slash words easy to
[00:14:31] remember now let's say you know all 14
[00:14:33] of those
[00:14:33] peaks which you now do but maybe you
[00:14:35] want to actually also know
[00:14:37] the heights in meters now we all know
[00:14:39] they're 8 000 meter peaks
[00:14:41] so we can just ignore the first digit we
[00:14:43] all know it's an eight
[00:14:44] so all we have to do is memorize a word
[00:14:46] to represent each of those three digit
[00:14:48] numbers
[00:14:48] for those 14 peaks and what we'll do is
[00:14:51] since we have
[00:14:52] all the locations 14 locations 14 images
[00:14:54] all you have to do is kind of
[00:14:55] layer on this extra image and mix it in
[00:14:59] with what we already crazily imagined
[00:15:03] and you can have now have the name and
[00:15:05] the height
[00:15:06] so i'm going to list what those images
[00:15:08] are you can do a little more digging
[00:15:10] yourself to understand why that is if
[00:15:11] you
[00:15:12] want to know more about the major system
[00:15:13] learn it and this will make more sense
[00:15:15] or come up with your own so for everest
[00:15:17] our first location
[00:15:18] we had 8848 which translates
[00:15:21] since we're just taking the last three
[00:15:23] digits 848 to fear of so imagine
[00:15:26] climbing everest you have a fear of
[00:15:28] climbing everest that makes sense right
[00:15:29] the next one k2 is 8
[00:15:31] 611 meters so we're going to remember a
[00:15:34] word for 6
[00:15:35] 11 which is shot and tie
[00:15:38] so imagine that this dog that's running
[00:15:41] around
[00:15:42] has shot some ties the next one is 8586
[00:15:45] i have love chew to try to incorporate
[00:15:48] the image of
[00:15:48] loving to choose something there and
[00:15:50] i'll let you guys try the rest
[00:15:52] pause if you gotta keep in mind though
[00:15:54] that these are just suggestions
[00:15:55] i honestly think that the best mnemonics
[00:15:57] are the ones you come up with yourself
[00:16:00] [Music]
[00:16:02] oh there's helicopter all right guys
[00:16:05] that's it thanks so much for watching
[00:16:06] this video i hope that was super helpful
[00:16:08] you got a little bit of
[00:16:09] uh inside info on what it's like to live
[00:16:11] at base camp what
[00:16:13] i have to deal with for the past few
[00:16:15] weeks and for a six
[00:16:16] week to eight week period and you've
[00:16:19] learned the 14 highest peaks and
[00:16:21] potentially if you wanted to if you
[00:16:22] learned the major system you can also
[00:16:23] know their heights as well
[00:16:25] how cool is that stored actually on
[00:16:27] everest
[00:16:28] memory techniques are so awesome right i
[00:16:30] mean i'll see you guys back in my studio
[00:16:32] in a few weeks
[00:16:33] thanks for watching i'm out
[00:16:38] [Music]
[00:16:49] you


=== reacting to MORE IMPOSSIBLE memory feats (Bijay Shahi & Lebron James) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pZOhBfZPOE

[00:00:00] this video is sponsored by mind lab pro
[00:00:03] what's up guys nelson delos here and
[00:00:04] today we are doing another
[00:00:06] reaction video last one was well
[00:00:09] received
[00:00:10] and well it was probably because thanks
[00:00:12] to bj
[00:00:13] shahi but there's tons of other
[00:00:16] memory performances out there that i
[00:00:19] would love to critique
[00:00:20] look at see who's real see who's fake
[00:00:22] see who's using memory techniques see
[00:00:24] who's not
[00:00:25] my perspective as a memory champion on
[00:00:27] what is out there on the web
[00:00:29] now i feel like i wouldn't be doing this
[00:00:30] video justice if i didn't say anything
[00:00:32] about
[00:00:33] bj shahi for those of you that don't
[00:00:35] know you should watch my old video
[00:00:37] there was this guy from nepal who
[00:00:39] claimed that he could
[00:00:41] basically memorize an entire book
[00:00:42] thousands of pages in
[00:00:44] under 10 minutes and there was video of
[00:00:46] him doing this
[00:00:50] but it was questionable you can judge
[00:00:52] the video yourself
[00:00:53] i'll leave it in the description anyways
[00:00:55] i challenged him to come on my channel
[00:00:57] prove
[00:00:58] his stuff to me very knowledgeable
[00:01:01] memory expert
[00:01:02] i'd say right never heard from him i
[00:01:04] actually heard from
[00:01:06] three of his cousins they all claim to
[00:01:08] be his cousins
[00:01:10] anyways this
[00:01:13] this happened a few months ago but i i
[00:01:16] saw it coming
[00:01:16] and i'm it brought me some kind of joy
[00:01:20] in a way to see this
[00:01:22] the way it panned out but there was a
[00:01:24] press event and i don't speak nepalese
[00:01:27] so i don't really know what was said but
[00:01:28] i have the gist of it the reporters
[00:01:30] found
[00:01:31] hidden sheets behind his podium that had
[00:01:34] imprints
[00:01:35] of what he was going to write out from
[00:01:38] memory supposedly
[00:01:44] so here we were all trying to figure out
[00:01:46] how he was doing this
[00:01:47] did he have a phone did he have an
[00:01:48] earpiece no
[00:01:50] he just traced it beforehand so that it
[00:01:52] was imprinted indented on the paper and
[00:01:55] then he wrote over it
[00:01:56] later no wonder he had to be in a
[00:01:58] separate room to write out
[00:02:00] everything no wonder he had to be way
[00:02:02] off in the distance hunched over writing
[00:02:04] stuff because he was just copying
[00:02:06] genius actually very impressed but
[00:02:09] anyways
[00:02:10] in dramatic fashion the reporters
[00:02:12] finally came to their senses called him
[00:02:14] out
[00:02:15] and uh he had this very dramatic
[00:02:18] exit which i believe in nepal is gone
[00:02:21] meme worthy
[00:02:27] i love it that's just that's so juicy i
[00:02:30] love it
[00:02:31] i love it anyways enough about him let's
[00:02:33] move on to more interesting things
[00:02:35] all right so the way this will work some
[00:02:36] people have sent me videos to critique
[00:02:38] to look out
[00:02:39] some i may have seen some i haven't i
[00:02:41] don't know yet i've seen a lot
[00:02:43] around the internet but maybe it's
[00:02:44] something i haven't seen either way i'm
[00:02:46] gonna comment on it
[00:02:47] tell you if i think it's real and if it
[00:02:49] is how they're doing it
[00:02:50] or if it's fake how i think they may be
[00:02:52] doing it
[00:02:53] and we'll see what happens
[00:02:57] the first one we're going to look at is
[00:02:59] this one by
[00:03:00] a spanish guy ramon campayo i hope i
[00:03:03] said that right
[00:03:04] and his thing is he's a speed memorizer
[00:03:08] okay so there's a speed memory
[00:03:10] championship and it's
[00:03:12] kind of crazy because in these
[00:03:14] competitions
[00:03:15] you're basically testing one second and
[00:03:18] maybe four seconds
[00:03:19] of how much you can memorize for numbers
[00:03:22] binary numbers i think words matrices
[00:03:25] with
[00:03:25] different colors stuff like that it's
[00:03:27] hard and when you see what ramon can do
[00:03:30] it's baffling and i think
[00:03:34] he designed the championship and he's
[00:03:37] always won it
[00:03:38] or something like that i i could be
[00:03:40] wrong it may have changed but
[00:03:41] um he is the best at this stuff so let's
[00:03:44] take a look
[00:03:53] that's crazy it just flashed
[00:03:56] one second and what's interesting to me
[00:04:00] is seeing
[00:04:02] how he viewed the numbers like i i've
[00:04:05] used that software before and you can
[00:04:06] set up how you want digits to appear so
[00:04:08] it's kind of bizarre that he had that
[00:04:11] weird formation
[00:04:13] there it is
[00:04:26] so you saw that immediately after seeing
[00:04:28] it he was writing it down that's allowed
[00:04:30] in this championship
[00:04:31] and i don't think that it's something to
[00:04:32] make you think that this isn't real
[00:04:34] because
[00:04:34] just imagine seeing anything flashed
[00:04:36] that large on screen
[00:04:38] and then it's gone even writing it down
[00:04:41] immediately
[00:04:42] after it's really hard right you're
[00:04:43] writing all these zeros and ones by the
[00:04:45] time you get to the other end or
[00:04:46] you try to write them all you've
[00:04:48] probably forgotten most of them
[00:04:49] right so still crazy impressive i don't
[00:04:52] know if this is still the
[00:04:53] record but wow now i've had some
[00:04:56] correspondence with him over the years i
[00:04:57] know he uses the same kind of memory
[00:04:59] techniques that i do
[00:05:01] basically turning those numbers into
[00:05:03] words i just don't know
[00:05:04] what how he's translating it that's
[00:05:07] that's incredible that's
[00:05:09] beyond my capabilities maybe with
[00:05:11] training i can get faster i know he does
[00:05:12] train
[00:05:13] and the people who are doing also really
[00:05:16] well in these championships these speed
[00:05:18] memory championships are his
[00:05:19] students so clearly there's something
[00:05:22] there
[00:05:22] um yeah next
[00:05:29] all right next up is one of my all-time
[00:05:31] favorites i've
[00:05:33] watched him for years it's probably one
[00:05:35] of the earliest
[00:05:37] ted talks i ever saw which was art
[00:05:38] benjamin and his math magics
[00:05:41] now if you don't know who art benjamin
[00:05:42] is he is a
[00:05:44] professor i think at brown university of
[00:05:46] math
[00:05:47] but more importantly he is a mental
[00:05:50] calculator
[00:05:50] and he does these great really
[00:05:52] entertaining shows
[00:05:54] about magic and math and he always ends
[00:05:57] with this five-digit squaring
[00:06:00] performance where he takes a five-digit
[00:06:02] number pulled from the audience
[00:06:04] and squares it multiplies it by itself
[00:06:06] while that's impressive and i'm not
[00:06:08] really going to comment
[00:06:08] on that because that's a whole other
[00:06:11] video it's interesting because he uses
[00:06:13] mnemonics
[00:06:14] in the middle of it because the numbers
[00:06:15] are so big he has to hold
[00:06:18] certain parts of the answer in his mind
[00:06:20] using
[00:06:21] the major system basically turning those
[00:06:23] chunks of numbers into images or words
[00:06:26] so that they're easy to remember when he
[00:06:27] has to go back and tally them all up to
[00:06:29] get the final answer
[00:06:30] he's just so fast at it it's awesome so
[00:06:32] let's watch without any more stalling
[00:06:36] here we go i'll start the problem in the
[00:06:39] middle with 37 times 691 now let's see
[00:06:42] oh my gosh so that's 700 minus 9 i'll
[00:06:44] take advantage of that now 700 times 37
[00:06:45] is 25
[00:06:47] thirty seven times nine is three thirty
[00:06:48] three subtract the two to get twenty
[00:06:50] five thousand
[00:06:51] five sixty seven twenty five thousand uh
[00:06:53] do i believe that yeah twenty five
[00:06:54] thousand five sixty seven double that to
[00:06:56] get fifty
[00:06:57] one thousand one hundred thirty four
[00:06:59] fifty one thousand
[00:07:00] one hundred 134 okay 51 000 becomes
[00:07:03] light tomorrow light tomorrow
[00:07:05] is 51 134 that seems right i'll go on
[00:07:09] next i do 37 squared which is one three
[00:07:11] six nine so i can say
[00:07:13] one billion take the 369 add that to
[00:07:16] light is there going to be carry now 369
[00:07:18] and that's like 420 million
[00:07:22] tomorrow tomorrow okay next we do 691
[00:07:24] squared that's 700 times 682 plus nine
[00:07:27] squared that's 400. that's why that's
[00:07:29] raft if i need it wrap take the 477
[00:07:32] and that to tomorrow to get 611
[00:07:38] 481 yes
[00:07:41] good thank you all very much i hope you
[00:07:44] enjoyed mathematics i'm arthur benjamin
[00:07:48] wow so what he had light tomorrow and
[00:07:50] possibly the use of
[00:07:52] raft so those three words uh were
[00:07:54] holding
[00:07:55] a three-digit number each right lights
[00:07:58] well wait
[00:07:59] lights would be two digits unless what
[00:08:01] did he do there
[00:08:02] uh fifty one thousand one thirty four so
[00:08:05] he used
[00:08:06] light tomorrow to remember fifty one
[00:08:08] thousand one thirty four fifty one
[00:08:10] is light the five and the one is an lt
[00:08:13] and then 134
[00:08:14] is tmr tomorrow that helps them remember
[00:08:18] that
[00:08:18] five digit number anyways this is
[00:08:20] awesome
[00:08:22] cool all right
[00:08:25] next up i don't know this one i don't
[00:08:27] think i've ever seen it
[00:08:28] but the title of the video is fastest
[00:08:32] time to say all 44 u.s presidents in
[00:08:34] order
[00:08:35] with eyes closed aka from memory
[00:08:38] based on my last video where we reviewed
[00:08:40] a kid saying pie really fast
[00:08:43] i let them have it i don't like these
[00:08:45] kind of records because
[00:08:47] most of the time you can't even tell
[00:08:49] what the frick they're saying
[00:08:50] so let's let's let's give them a shot
[00:08:52] here i'm just layers i'm 12 years old
[00:08:54] and i'm going to attempt to break the
[00:08:56] criminal record for saying the
[00:08:57] president's passes and not
[00:08:58] here's my clock said zero i'm pressing
[00:09:00] working really really hard and records
[00:09:02] really hard to beat
[00:09:03] and by the way this is the first record
[00:09:05] i've ever done on records here so it's
[00:09:06] really special to me
[00:09:07] and i'm just trying to well he talks
[00:09:09] really fast so he's got that going for
[00:09:11] him i
[00:09:12] don't really understand a lot of what
[00:09:13] he's saying but here we go
[00:09:15] and i'm just trying to defend my tail
[00:09:16] and i've been practicing a lot and
[00:09:18] getting a lot faster than i ever thought
[00:09:19] was even possible to get down to
[00:09:21] and i want to get on video today and and
[00:09:24] i just been pressing a lot i'm going to
[00:09:25] keep on practicing
[00:09:27] until i get so here you go i'm not going
[00:09:29] to give up here you go
[00:09:55] 4.81 seconds 4.81 seconds
[00:09:59] wow i don't even think i heard a
[00:10:01] president name
[00:10:02] that like sounded like a president name
[00:10:05] ah
[00:10:05] i hate these records because the thing
[00:10:07] is like whatever the record is someone
[00:10:08] wants to get faster you have to
[00:10:10] eventually
[00:10:11] blur the words because you can't really
[00:10:13] go faster than
[00:10:14] the physics of your voice and your mouth
[00:10:17] right but man this is uh
[00:10:20] i mean bravo right if this counts but
[00:10:24] if we slow it down can we even hear
[00:10:28] real president names let's let's see
[00:10:37] [Music]
[00:10:41] no offense to this kid great work on
[00:10:44] getting to this point and
[00:10:45] i'm sure he knows all the presidents
[00:10:47] which is great um but
[00:10:49] not a big fan of these records sorry all
[00:10:51] right and now while i talk a little bit
[00:10:52] about today's sponsor let's watch
[00:10:54] andrea mutzi the world memory champion
[00:10:57] memorize
[00:10:58] and solve a rubik's cube blindfolded
[00:11:01] while
[00:11:01] also driving a bike with no hands
[00:11:05] what so minelab pro is the world's first
[00:11:07] universal nootropic
[00:11:09] and it's one that i've been trying for
[00:11:10] the past six months i really like it
[00:11:12] just because it's unlike any other
[00:11:13] nootropic that i've ever tried on the
[00:11:15] market usually
[00:11:16] nootropics will just target one or two
[00:11:18] pathways like memory or focus
[00:11:20] but these guys target as many pathways
[00:11:22] as possible six
[00:11:23] to be exact to optimize all areas of
[00:11:26] cognition
[00:11:27] i like their branding i like their style
[00:11:29] i like that they are the industry's
[00:11:31] cleanest smartest and most sophisticated
[00:11:33] formula so
[00:11:34] please give them some love check out the
[00:11:35] link in the description and check out
[00:11:37] some of their products
[00:11:40] i think i've seen this before it's been
[00:11:42] a long time the title is this artist
[00:11:44] draws detailed cityscapes entirely from
[00:11:46] memory
[00:11:47] i think his name is like steven
[00:11:50] wiltshire or something like that let's
[00:11:53] have a look
[00:11:54] and then memorize it and then after
[00:11:56] being on a helicopter and then
[00:11:59] straight back at the hotel and then
[00:12:01] started to draw
[00:12:03] his incredible talent launched an
[00:12:04] artistic career that has taken him
[00:12:06] around the world
[00:12:07] los angeles dubai houston texas
[00:12:11] and tokyo and japan and that's just to
[00:12:14] name a few
[00:12:15] new york's my favorite empire state
[00:12:17] building
[00:12:18] and steven has no plans of stopping
[00:12:20] anytime soon someone told me that
[00:12:23] people liked me drawings feel good
[00:12:26] always be happy about it
[00:12:28] that's it i wish i'd given us more
[00:12:30] detail but those pictures
[00:12:31] i'd be curious to know how accurate they
[00:12:33] are but even still
[00:12:35] from what i'm saying it looks incredibly
[00:12:38] detailed he's obviously
[00:12:39] able to pick up so much detail and from
[00:12:42] what i understand he's on the spectrum
[00:12:44] so
[00:12:45] you know he has a highly specialized
[00:12:47] skill here which he's clearly tapped
[00:12:49] into it's
[00:12:50] phenomenal i wouldn't say this is fake
[00:12:51] this looks real um
[00:12:53] it's an incredible skill and amazing
[00:12:55] talent he has
[00:12:56] anyways cool next one
[00:13:00] super fun i always got to kind of throw
[00:13:02] in some video game thing another
[00:13:04] blindfolded
[00:13:05] speed run this time of super mario world
[00:13:08] so
[00:13:08] last time we took a look at super mario
[00:13:11] 64
[00:13:12] which is 3d environment this one is a 2d
[00:13:16] platformer which i'd assume it's easier
[00:13:19] there's only four directions your
[00:13:21] thing can move but because these are
[00:13:23] older games i don't think that they have
[00:13:25] the same
[00:13:26] kind of um audio design complexity as
[00:13:29] mario 64. there were a lot of audio cues
[00:13:32] you could use
[00:13:33] in that 3d game to your advantage here i
[00:13:36] don't know what that's like let's take a
[00:13:38] look
[00:13:39] i guess this is one of the early levels
[00:13:42] oh this level is hard because there's
[00:13:44] places you can fall
[00:13:48] all right so far
[00:13:50] [Music]
[00:13:53] okay see a lot of these you know i i
[00:13:56] could imagine with practice you just get
[00:13:58] the feel
[00:13:58] for you know where there's land when you
[00:14:02] have to jump the timing
[00:14:03] [Music]
[00:14:06] interesting going back there i'm sure
[00:14:08] he's just kind of like
[00:14:09] resetting himself but there's no audio
[00:14:12] cues if you run into a wall
[00:14:14] you don't know that in super mario 64
[00:14:17] you could run into a wall and actually
[00:14:19] get some audio uh feedback
[00:14:21] [Music]
[00:14:22] wow that was rough uh
[00:14:26] i forgot it again i might have just not
[00:14:29] even made that platform i probably just
[00:14:32] let go jump too early all right good to
[00:14:33] know that he's not perfect that's good
[00:14:37] [Music]
[00:14:40] this is even just that little section is
[00:14:42] pretty impressive because now
[00:14:46] like he times that well he knows how far
[00:14:47] he has to go with the controller
[00:14:50] there let's see yeah he got it
[00:14:58] that's pretty good
[00:15:02] all right cool i so want to try
[00:15:06] learning a blindfold speed run of a game
[00:15:08] that i love maybe a mario game
[00:15:10] let me know in the description if you'd
[00:15:11] like to see me make a video on me trying
[00:15:15] to learn how to do that
[00:15:18] all right i've gotten a few requests for
[00:15:21] this one
[00:15:22] and i've heard about this i've heard
[00:15:24] about lebron james memory
[00:15:26] that he has a photographic memory and
[00:15:29] i've always been a bit skeptical of
[00:15:31] people or the claim that someone has a
[00:15:34] photographic memory
[00:15:35] because the context is never given so
[00:15:39] many people for example would say just
[00:15:42] casually
[00:15:42] when talking about me that i have a
[00:15:44] photographic memory i don't
[00:15:46] i don't i have a trained memory but in
[00:15:48] passing somebody might say oh nelson has
[00:15:50] a very good memory you can look at
[00:15:51] something very quickly
[00:15:52] that is photographic memory to me so
[00:15:55] when somebody says or claims
[00:15:57] really quickly oh that guy's a
[00:15:58] photographic memory or my grandmother
[00:16:00] had one oh
[00:16:01] i had a friend who had a photographic
[00:16:02] memory it's like
[00:16:04] i don't really know what that means
[00:16:05] because in my mind
[00:16:07] photographic memory means you can look
[00:16:09] at something take a photograph snapshot
[00:16:12] that means like a second or two and then
[00:16:14] you have the entire thing
[00:16:15] mapped in your mind personally i don't
[00:16:17] think that exists
[00:16:19] at least to that level unless we're
[00:16:21] talking about some of these savants like
[00:16:22] we saw steven wheelchair that might be
[00:16:23] an exception
[00:16:24] but for the average person i don't think
[00:16:26] that really exists
[00:16:27] we all have varying degrees of that
[00:16:29] capability what i'm saying is
[00:16:31] the idea of photographic memory is very
[00:16:34] lightly used and it doesn't always mean
[00:16:37] what
[00:16:38] everybody thinks it means so anyways
[00:16:42] lebron's a really intelligent guy i love
[00:16:45] the way he plays
[00:16:46] but i've never i've i've heard about it
[00:16:48] i've never seen any examples of it so
[00:16:49] let's watch this this is a video
[00:16:51] of him i think talking about
[00:16:54] a series of plays uh from memory so
[00:16:57] let's see
[00:16:58] the start of the fourth i think they cut
[00:16:59] at the 14. um
[00:17:01] do you have any idea what i mean i think
[00:17:03] they scored seven quick ones
[00:17:04] anything what happened there what
[00:17:06] happened um
[00:17:09] we ran him the first possession we ran
[00:17:11] him down all the way to two on the shot
[00:17:13] clock marcus morris missed a jump shot
[00:17:15] followed it up he got it they got a dunk
[00:17:18] we came back down we ran a set for
[00:17:19] jordan crawford i mean jordan clarkson
[00:17:22] and he came off and missed it they
[00:17:23] rebounded
[00:17:25] um and we came back on the defensive end
[00:17:28] and we got to stop they took it out on
[00:17:29] the sideline
[00:17:31] jason tatum took the ball out threw
[00:17:33] demarcus smart in the short corner he
[00:17:34] made it three
[00:17:35] we come back down missed another shot
[00:17:38] and then um
[00:17:40] tatum came down and went 94 feet did a
[00:17:43] year old step
[00:17:44] and made a right hand layup time-out
[00:17:50] there you go what
[00:17:54] wow that that's cool that is
[00:17:59] that's awesome that is just an
[00:18:02] amazing showcase of someone who is the
[00:18:05] best at what they do and
[00:18:09] when you're the best you remember stuff
[00:18:12] like that
[00:18:13] i don't think he knows how he does it i
[00:18:14] just know that he has a love for the
[00:18:15] game he has a really high iq in
[00:18:17] basketball
[00:18:18] that's stunning man that means that just
[00:18:21] shows you like
[00:18:22] to have this guy on your team he is in
[00:18:24] the game
[00:18:25] how attentive must you be how invested
[00:18:28] in the game in the moment must you be
[00:18:30] to recall all that information right not
[00:18:33] everybody's like that
[00:18:34] and that's why lebron is lebron right um
[00:18:39] but man how many he like got the names
[00:18:42] of the people who scored
[00:18:43] what happened on the possessions even
[00:18:45] that little fine detail of the guy doing
[00:18:48] the euro step at the end
[00:18:49] for his layup like that's fascinating
[00:18:51] fascinating so he remembered
[00:18:53] probably remembers more but he
[00:18:54] remembered about a minute and a half
[00:18:57] maybe a bit less of play-by-play six
[00:19:00] possessions
[00:19:01] that's nuts i don't think i can do that
[00:19:03] this guy needs to compete
[00:19:05] in memory competitions for sure
[00:19:08] could you repeat that so i said yeah
[00:19:11] so it's person woman man camera tv
[00:19:16] okay that's very good i'm just kidding

=== THIS VIDEO WILL MAKE YOU A POLYGLOT (in 20 minutes)!! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLDHaVKm55w

[00:00:00] so guys i just found a little loophole
[00:00:03] i figured something out the other day i
[00:00:05] was thinking
[00:00:07] what is a polyglot what's the definition
[00:00:09] of a polyglot clearly it's someone who
[00:00:11] knows a lot of languages but know to
[00:00:14] what extent
[00:00:15] so i did a bit of research turns out
[00:00:17] that there actually is
[00:00:19] a really vague definition of what a
[00:00:21] polyglot means
[00:00:22] which means that you might be a polyglot
[00:00:25] maybe not yet
[00:00:26] but by the end of this video you will be
[00:00:33] so according to webster's dictionary
[00:00:36] the definition of a polyglot is one who
[00:00:39] is a polyglot
[00:00:41] okay just kidding i mean that's what it
[00:00:43] says speaking or writing
[00:00:45] several languages now to what extent how
[00:00:48] much do you need to be able to speak it
[00:00:49] how much you need to be able to write it
[00:00:51] what if you just knew two words
[00:00:54] in many many languages polyglot
[00:00:58] i'd argue sure in some contexts yeah so
[00:01:01] that's what we're going to do in this
[00:01:02] video
[00:01:02] you are going to become a polyglot by
[00:01:04] the end of this video we are going to
[00:01:06] use the drops app to memorize
[00:01:08] all the languages in the app it's like
[00:01:09] around 40 or something like that
[00:01:12] hello and goodbye simple greetings that
[00:01:15] might be useful
[00:01:16] definitely won't make you fluent
[00:01:17] definitely won't help you with a lot of
[00:01:19] things
[00:01:19] to survive in the wild in a foreign
[00:01:22] country
[00:01:23] but you will be a polyglot nonetheless
[00:01:26] so how we're going to do this really
[00:01:27] quick well for each of the languages
[00:01:29] we're going to come up with an image
[00:01:31] that just represents the language maybe
[00:01:33] it's related to the country that speaks
[00:01:34] it
[00:01:35] or maybe it's something that the word
[00:01:37] the language word sounds like it has
[00:01:40] nothing to do with the actual language
[00:01:41] but something to remind us of
[00:01:43] what the word is for the language so we
[00:01:44] have a reference then we're going to
[00:01:46] come up with a mnemonic to remember
[00:01:48] hello and goodbye and then associate
[00:01:51] them together
[00:01:52] that's how we do things here we connect
[00:01:54] we link
[00:01:55] we link things because our brain works
[00:01:56] better when we link stuff we don't know
[00:01:58] the stuff that we do know in case you're
[00:02:00] interested these are the languages that
[00:02:02] we're gonna learn
[00:02:03] arabic brazilian portuguese chinese
[00:02:05] croatian
[00:02:06] danish dutch estonian finnish french
[00:02:08] german
[00:02:10] greek hawaiian hebrew hindi hungarian
[00:02:13] icelandic
[00:02:14] italian indonesian japanese korean
[00:02:18] uh what else we're gonna do norwegian
[00:02:21] persian
[00:02:23] polish russian samoan serbian spanish
[00:02:27] swahili
[00:02:28] tagalog thai turkish and vietnamese
[00:02:35] all right one quick thing i gotta say is
[00:02:36] that a lot of these greetings hellos and
[00:02:38] goodbyes
[00:02:40] you know i don't speak these languages
[00:02:42] perfectly
[00:02:43] most of them i don't at least obviously
[00:02:45] in all languages there are multiple ways
[00:02:47] to say hello and goodbye depending on
[00:02:50] how informal you want to be how polite
[00:02:52] you want to be
[00:02:53] what time of day it is how casual it is
[00:02:56] whatever so
[00:02:57] i might be mixing some here and there
[00:02:58] this is based on my research and using
[00:03:00] the drops app
[00:03:01] so we're learning what i'm giving to you
[00:03:04] and
[00:03:04] if i'm wrong please excuse me you can
[00:03:07] correct me in the comments i'd love to
[00:03:09] hear from you especially from the native
[00:03:11] people from the languages that i'm
[00:03:12] butchering first one is
[00:03:14] arabic all right and my image for arabic
[00:03:17] i'm gonna go with
[00:03:18] a rabbit so arab bit a rabbit
[00:03:21] just sounds like arabic and the way to
[00:03:23] say hello is maraban
[00:03:25] and the way to say goodbye is ila alika
[00:03:27] so how would i remember that need to
[00:03:29] relate those two things to a rabbit
[00:03:31] somehow so i'm going to break it apart
[00:03:33] into
[00:03:33] kind of what it sounds like it kind of
[00:03:34] sounds like
[00:03:38] i'm really butchering the pronunciation
[00:03:39] there but this is to help you kind of
[00:03:41] get the idea
[00:03:42] if you really want to nail down the
[00:03:44] pronunciation that's another matter all
[00:03:45] right so
[00:03:46] mar haban kind of sounds like a marring
[00:03:48] or
[00:03:49] destroying or defacing haban a ban
[00:03:53] a van it's close enough to help you
[00:03:54] remember the thing so think of a rabbit
[00:03:57] marring a van and now to remember the
[00:04:00] goodbye we got to kind of connect that
[00:04:02] into a story so the rabbit is
[00:04:04] marring a haban a van and he suddenly
[00:04:06] feels ill
[00:04:07] and he's going to go drink a bottle of
[00:04:09] liquor ilalika
[00:04:11] bill lika liquor
[00:04:14] yeah i know this is how it works right
[00:04:16] these aren't perfect exact
[00:04:18] copies of what you're supposed to
[00:04:19] remember but it's enough to get you the
[00:04:21] distance
[00:04:22] all right next one is brazilian
[00:04:23] portuguese so the image for brazil
[00:04:26] i'm going to think of maybe a soccer
[00:04:27] ball it's arguable i know
[00:04:29] but let's just go with brazil because
[00:04:30] they're pretty good at soccer usually
[00:04:32] not always usually
[00:04:35] and the hello and goodbye are super easy
[00:04:37] it's oi and
[00:04:39] ciao so what i would picture is you know
[00:04:41] somebody's playing soccer
[00:04:42] and they say hey
[00:04:46] you got bloody out of you boy is
[00:04:48] something i would say like if i wanted
[00:04:49] someone's attention
[00:04:50] and ciao literally sounds like ciao like
[00:04:54] food that you eat so i'm saying oy pass
[00:04:57] me the ball
[00:04:57] and some chow all right i think of the
[00:05:00] great wall of china that's my image for
[00:05:02] china
[00:05:02] and to say hello is nihao which always
[00:05:05] reminds me of a knee
[00:05:06] and somebody just asked me how so maybe
[00:05:09] this great wall is built with a bunch of
[00:05:10] kneecaps and you just look at it and say
[00:05:12] how how is that possible me how
[00:05:16] and then to say goodbye it's zai shen
[00:05:18] i'm probably butchering that zay chen
[00:05:20] zeitschen say chen so it kind of sounds
[00:05:22] like you're gonna say
[00:05:24] chain like say the word chain so we have
[00:05:26] the great wall of china
[00:05:27] right and it's made of kneecaps and
[00:05:29] you're saying how but then after that
[00:05:31] after you've kind of come to terms with
[00:05:33] it you realize that they're all
[00:05:34] connected by a bunch of chains
[00:05:36] so you say chains all right next we have
[00:05:39] croatian and so my image for croatia is
[00:05:41] a crow
[00:05:42] just the bird and the way to say hello
[00:05:44] is bulk
[00:05:46] so you can think of this crow is reading
[00:05:48] a book a book
[00:05:49] and actually when he opens it because
[00:05:51] he's a bird there's a dove
[00:05:53] and he's got some chains on ya so it's
[00:05:56] dovchenya that's how you say goodbye
[00:06:00] for danish i think of a danish
[00:06:03] cool that's my picture and to say hello
[00:06:05] it's easy it's just
[00:06:06] hey so maybe someone's eating danish
[00:06:08] just tap them on the shoulder and you
[00:06:10] say
[00:06:10] hey now saying goodbye i couldn't for
[00:06:12] the life of me come up with an image
[00:06:14] because it's just such a
[00:06:15] unique word it's favel so maybe you
[00:06:18] could think of like
[00:06:19] kind of sounds like shovel chevelle
[00:06:21] shovel chevelle
[00:06:24] favel so maybe you say hey because you
[00:06:26] want that danish and you want to
[00:06:28] fuvel it into your mouth shovel it into
[00:06:31] your mouth shovel it into your mouth
[00:06:32] favel
[00:06:33] hey favel think of a clock that's the
[00:06:36] image i have for dutch
[00:06:37] and the way to say hello there's a bunch
[00:06:39] of ways to say it the one i'm going to
[00:06:41] choose is da
[00:06:42] okay with that kind of at the end of
[00:06:44] your throat
[00:06:45] and the way to say goodbye you could
[00:06:47] actually just say doc as well but you
[00:06:49] can also say
[00:06:50] dewey it's a very dutch thing all right
[00:06:52] so you think of that clog and let's put
[00:06:54] a
[00:06:54] duck in that clog now i know it's da
[00:06:58] is not the same as duck but it's close
[00:07:00] enough just got to know that that at the
[00:07:02] end is not pronounced
[00:07:03] it's pronounced kind of like a softer
[00:07:05] way and then as that duck gets in the
[00:07:08] clog he says
[00:07:10] i mean is like the sound you make when
[00:07:11] it's like
[00:07:13] the super obvious so
[00:07:16] next one is estonian all right and i
[00:07:18] think of a stone that's my image for
[00:07:20] that
[00:07:20] and the way to say hello is tere which
[00:07:22] makes me think of like
[00:07:24] tearing something and the way to say
[00:07:27] goodbye is naga mist which sounds like
[00:07:29] i'm nagging
[00:07:30] like the mist just annoying it or
[00:07:32] something so let's picture a stone
[00:07:34] all right that you're trying to tear in
[00:07:36] half and
[00:07:37] you're tearing it in half to just throw
[00:07:39] it into this mist that's coming at you
[00:07:41] and you want to nag it
[00:07:42] all right so you're tearing this stone
[00:07:45] and nagging the mist with it so tere
[00:07:48] and naga mist next we have finish so i
[00:07:51] just think of finishing something
[00:07:53] that sounds like the word finish and the
[00:07:55] way to say hello
[00:07:56] is hey some of these are super easy and
[00:07:58] the way to say goodbye there's a bunch
[00:07:59] of ways but i think the funnest way
[00:08:01] the most casual is imagine you just
[00:08:04] finished something and you just quickly
[00:08:06] say
[00:08:06] hey it's kind of weird usually when you
[00:08:08] finish something you say goodbye but no
[00:08:09] you say hey
[00:08:10] maybe as you're finishing up and you say
[00:08:12] hey you look up and you say oh this
[00:08:14] person looks pretty good
[00:08:16] my my moy moy and then french we all
[00:08:19] know french
[00:08:20] right think of the eiffel tower that's
[00:08:21] our image we say bonjour which if i need
[00:08:24] to give you an image for that one
[00:08:25] come on and to say goodbye is or you
[00:08:27] could say
[00:08:29] i don't need to give you guys an image
[00:08:30] for this one you guys should know this
[00:08:32] if not go watch
[00:08:33] a bunch of french movies all right next
[00:08:35] we have german all right which we can
[00:08:37] just picture a german shepherd that's my
[00:08:38] image for german
[00:08:40] and to say hello it's very easy it's
[00:08:42] hello
[00:08:43] hello hello and say goodbye it's i just
[00:08:46] imagine a german shepherd being super
[00:08:48] chipper saying hello
[00:08:50] and then he's obsessed with shoes oh my
[00:08:52] god i just love the shoes oh my god
[00:08:54] shoes shoes next up is greek and for
[00:08:57] greek or greece i would picture the
[00:08:58] parthenon very symbolic easy to imagine
[00:09:01] structure
[00:09:02] and the way to say hello is yasu and to
[00:09:04] say goodbye
[00:09:05] is andiyo so i would imagine inside of
[00:09:07] this parthenon
[00:09:08] that maybe i'm in line for some soup and
[00:09:10] someone comes up to me and asks if i
[00:09:12] would like some i'd say
[00:09:13] yeah soup soup yeah soup yes
[00:09:16] there's no pee but yeah and then when
[00:09:18] they ask for your name you have this big
[00:09:20] name tag on that says ann
[00:09:22] d oh your andio next we have hawaiian
[00:09:25] which is very beautiful
[00:09:27] my picture for hawaiian is allay and the
[00:09:30] way to say hello we all know this
[00:09:32] is aloha and i think you can also say
[00:09:35] aloha to say goodbye but
[00:09:36] people also say huiho so the way to
[00:09:39] remember that
[00:09:39] is imagine with this lay i mean when
[00:09:41] everybody gets laid you always say aloha
[00:09:43] i don't think you'd be a mnemonic for
[00:09:45] that but a huiho
[00:09:46] kind of sounds like saying hoy
[00:09:51] something like a pirate would say but
[00:09:52] it's
[00:09:55] so when you say goodbye you imagine
[00:09:57] you're sailing off from the hawaiian
[00:09:58] islands and saying
[00:09:59] a holy ho some kind of altered version
[00:10:02] of ahoy
[00:10:04] next we have hebrew and for hebrew it
[00:10:06] has the word brew in it so i just
[00:10:08] picture a cup of
[00:10:09] brew a cup of coffee and we have two
[00:10:11] words shalom
[00:10:12] and the word say goodbye is may not be
[00:10:15] saying that perfectly but
[00:10:16] it breaks down into la heat ray
[00:10:20] oate i think that's right so what i
[00:10:23] would do is imagine just drinking a cup
[00:10:25] of coffee and saying
[00:10:26] shalom in a very respectful way and you
[00:10:29] take a sip and oh
[00:10:30] the heat the heat just makes you
[00:10:34] run out ray out
[00:10:38] next we have hindi i would just picture
[00:10:40] the taj mahal because it's in india
[00:10:41] very iconic structure and the way to say
[00:10:44] hello
[00:10:45] is namaste which you can also say
[00:10:47] goodbye as well if you want to keep it
[00:10:48] simple
[00:10:49] namaste maybe you can just imagine being
[00:10:51] in front of the taj mahal being as
[00:10:52] peaceful as possible maybe you're even
[00:10:54] doing yoga and you're just saying
[00:10:55] namaste namaste if you want an alternate
[00:10:59] way to say goodbye
[00:11:00] you can also say alvida which kind of
[00:11:01] sounds like i'll be back
[00:11:04] but with a v in there next we have
[00:11:06] hungarian to say hello
[00:11:09] is it sounds like sia which is sia
[00:11:12] so maybe think of being hungry that's my
[00:11:14] image for hungarian
[00:11:15] and you're so hungry that even before
[00:11:17] you say hello
[00:11:18] you say see ya because you're out of
[00:11:21] there you gotta get a bite to eat
[00:11:23] and then actually to say goodbye is
[00:11:25] bislat which sounds like
[00:11:27] like a v slot so maybe as soon as you
[00:11:31] say see ya hello you uh go
[00:11:34] get some food through some kind of
[00:11:35] vending machine and you put some money
[00:11:37] in that
[00:11:38] view slot all right next one is
[00:11:41] icelandic
[00:11:42] and it's a very difficult language but
[00:11:44] thank goodness
[00:11:45] the greetings are easy so to say hello
[00:11:48] the very informal one is just
[00:11:50] hi and then to say goodbye is also very
[00:11:52] easy it's bless
[00:11:53] those kind of make sense you're
[00:11:54] obviously gonna say hi when you say hi
[00:11:56] um and you're
[00:11:57] you know you're blessing someone before
[00:11:59] you leave that makes sense so
[00:12:00] maybe you can kind of associate it to
[00:12:02] iceland because it's cold
[00:12:04] so you want to keep it quick and say hi
[00:12:06] that's it gotta go it's too cold and
[00:12:08] then
[00:12:09] you know bless because hopefully you
[00:12:11] stay warm bless
[00:12:12] italian i don't think i need to tell you
[00:12:14] this you could just say well it's
[00:12:16] buongiorno or you could say chop think
[00:12:19] chow's the easiest one to remember and
[00:12:21] then also you can use
[00:12:22] ciao to say goodbye so you eat tons of
[00:12:24] italian food
[00:12:25] pasta pizza whatever you want so
[00:12:28] whenever you go to italy you're
[00:12:29] definitely going to chow
[00:12:30] you're going to chow down so say ciao
[00:12:32] and say hello you say ciao we say
[00:12:33] goodbye
[00:12:34] next up indonesian to say hello pretty
[00:12:36] simple just hi
[00:12:38] that's the easy one and then to say
[00:12:39] goodbye it's senpai
[00:12:41] jumpa so i think of like some pie in a
[00:12:44] jumper
[00:12:44] wearing a that's the english word for a
[00:12:46] sweater and so indonesia
[00:12:48] my picture for that is kind of like i
[00:12:50] just think of bali
[00:12:51] surfing right so maybe somebody's
[00:12:53] surfing on the waves
[00:12:55] and they say hi you know maybe it's a
[00:12:58] high wave
[00:12:58] which you could picture is while they're
[00:12:59] surfing after they've gone that high
[00:13:01] wave
[00:13:02] they've got some pie wearing a jumper or
[00:13:05] a sweater and they're eating it while
[00:13:06] they're surfing some pie jumper
[00:13:08] japanese okay a lot of people know this
[00:13:10] one but konnichiwa and sayonata i don't
[00:13:12] even know if you need to
[00:13:13] remember that many people know just
[00:13:14] konnichiwa and sayonara i just think of
[00:13:17] like
[00:13:18] some samurai about to kill someone
[00:13:20] saying sayonata
[00:13:22] korean next and we'll keep it simple
[00:13:24] some of their
[00:13:25] their words can be long and tricky to
[00:13:27] say so just to keep it simple is
[00:13:28] and young and that's for hello and
[00:13:30] goodbye and young so korean
[00:13:32] i think of like k-pop like a k-pop band
[00:13:35] and i would just picture them being
[00:13:37] super young and like me commenting on
[00:13:39] that saying
[00:13:40] and how young they are and young they're
[00:13:43] k-pop band
[00:13:44] and young and young all right then we
[00:13:47] have norwegian so it's easy to say hello
[00:13:49] it's
[00:13:50] hello and then to say goodbye it's so if
[00:13:53] we had
[00:13:54] an image for norway norwegian let's
[00:13:56] think of skis
[00:13:57] again i'm just going to picture someone
[00:13:58] skiing and just being super chipper
[00:14:00] saying hello and hades kind of sounds
[00:14:02] like a headache but you don't finish
[00:14:04] the word they're at high altitude skiing
[00:14:06] in the mountains and they have a head
[00:14:09] headache next we have persian i think
[00:14:11] it's the same as farsi
[00:14:13] and to say hello we say salaam and then
[00:14:15] to say goodbye is
[00:14:18] which is a tough one so i would imagine
[00:14:20] for persia i think of like a persian cat
[00:14:22] okay that's a very easy thing to picture
[00:14:24] and
[00:14:25] salaam i think of like salami so imagine
[00:14:27] this cat this persian cat is eating
[00:14:29] salami
[00:14:30] salam and to say goodbye hodo hafez
[00:14:33] kind of sounds like hold up and then
[00:14:35] something with half
[00:14:36] as so maybe imagine that this cat's
[00:14:39] eating the
[00:14:40] salami and you say hold up let's have it
[00:14:44] let's do half seas right you want to
[00:14:46] share that with them so
[00:14:47] hodo jafez polish all right and my image
[00:14:50] for polish is just a
[00:14:51] polish sausage and the way to say hello
[00:14:54] and essentially goodbye there are other
[00:14:56] ways to say goodbye but to keep it
[00:14:57] simple
[00:14:58] it's just chest which sounds like you're
[00:15:00] saying chess
[00:15:01] but with a ch at the end so
[00:15:05] so imagine that this sausage is playing
[00:15:07] chess but imagine this
[00:15:09] sausage for some reason just can't
[00:15:11] pronounce it correctly he's just saying
[00:15:13] chesh so for russia i think of like
[00:15:16] a vodka bottle and the way to say hello
[00:15:18] is privyet and the way to say goodbye
[00:15:20] is paca so i'm going to think of when i
[00:15:22] get that bottle in a vip
[00:15:23] room it's very private privet right and
[00:15:26] so when i get in there the first thing i
[00:15:28] do
[00:15:28] is when you say hello that's you're
[00:15:30] talking about the private room you say
[00:15:31] privy
[00:15:31] and then when you're done you want to
[00:15:34] leave you got to pack up
[00:15:35] all your stuff so you paka you pack up
[00:15:38] pack up your stuff
[00:15:39] samoan for samoan i think immediately of
[00:15:41] the rock
[00:15:42] and the way to say hello in simone is
[00:15:44] talofa
[00:15:45] and the way to say goodbye is fah so i'm
[00:15:47] going to picture the rock
[00:15:48] eating a loaf of bread talofa
[00:15:52] right when you say hi to him he's eating
[00:15:54] talofa bread and then just picture him
[00:15:56] throwing that sandwich
[00:15:57] on that loaf of bread to loaf of bread
[00:16:00] really far
[00:16:01] now he's strong so imagine he can really
[00:16:02] throw that far far
[00:16:04] away that's how you say goodbye to that
[00:16:06] talofa bread
[00:16:08] sandwich thing next we have serbian my
[00:16:11] image for serbian
[00:16:12] is a serpent sounds like serbian serpent
[00:16:15] and the way to say hello and goodbye
[00:16:16] essentially the same thing is
[00:16:17] dravo which sounds like i'm driving
[00:16:20] something but just with that
[00:16:22] z in the front so imagine that serpent
[00:16:24] is going in
[00:16:25] zigzags but driving right stravo
[00:16:28] i think we can skip that one because
[00:16:30] most people know that it's hola hola
[00:16:32] and adios adios
[00:16:36] class is over i'm trying to get you to
[00:16:38] leave swahili sounds like you're
[00:16:40] about to swat your heel like with a fly
[00:16:42] swatter
[00:16:43] swahili so that's our image for that and
[00:16:46] then the way to say hello is jumbo
[00:16:48] which sounds like it's like jam or like
[00:16:50] rambo
[00:16:51] covered in jam or something it's jambo
[00:16:53] and the way to say goodbye
[00:16:54] is which sounds like quite hairy so i
[00:16:57] would imagine
[00:16:58] you're trying to swat your heel and
[00:17:00] there's this tiny little
[00:17:01] jam covered rambo jambo and he's quite
[00:17:04] hairy
[00:17:05] that's it swedish fish love that candy
[00:17:08] you can eat that all day long hello is
[00:17:09] very simple it's just
[00:17:10] hi and then to say goodbye is kind of
[00:17:12] nice it's
[00:17:14] kind of sounds like you're saying hey do
[00:17:16] uh do i
[00:17:18] do i eat more swedish fish then we have
[00:17:21] tagalog
[00:17:22] which is basically filipino and it's
[00:17:24] kind of interesting how it sounds a lot
[00:17:26] like spanish so
[00:17:27] the way to say hello is kumusta which
[00:17:29] kind of sounds like como esta
[00:17:31] in spanish tagalog i think of like
[00:17:33] playing tag so people are running around
[00:17:35] playing tag and they're all saying just
[00:17:37] like como esta como esta
[00:17:39] i don't know maybe they're all a bunch
[00:17:41] of people from spain or something
[00:17:43] playing tag saying come esta
[00:17:44] and then to say goodbye it's baalam so
[00:17:47] maybe they're all running around asking
[00:17:48] each other
[00:17:49] but then there's a big paw or father
[00:17:53] or papa uh who's got an alarm he's just
[00:17:56] like guys
[00:17:57] the alarm went off it's over time to say
[00:17:59] goodbye next up
[00:18:00] is tai and there's a few different ways
[00:18:02] to say hello and goodbye
[00:18:03] so what d is the way to say hello and
[00:18:06] goodbye so let's
[00:18:07] memorize that so tai i think of like an
[00:18:09] actual business suit
[00:18:10] tai and so what d sounds like i'm saying
[00:18:14] i'm
[00:18:14] swatting the letter d two more we have
[00:18:18] turkish
[00:18:18] all right so obviously the image for
[00:18:20] that would be a turkey and the way they
[00:18:22] say hello is very similar to how we
[00:18:23] learned it for arabic which was
[00:18:25] madhhaban
[00:18:25] right this is very close right so you
[00:18:28] can just maybe think of like it's more
[00:18:30] that
[00:18:30] mer so maybe it's like a mermaid
[00:18:34] singing abba or something like that and
[00:18:36] then to say goodbye it's kind of tricky
[00:18:38] it's
[00:18:39] kind of sounds like a hose and a shackle
[00:18:41] hose and a shackle so hoshaka
[00:18:44] so imagine this mermaid uh singing abba
[00:18:48] maybe a hose is spraying water at her
[00:18:50] and she's in shackles
[00:18:51] hoshikawa so vietnamese i think of like
[00:18:53] a vet
[00:18:54] like a vet doctor the way to say hello
[00:18:57] super simple is jiao and the way to say
[00:19:00] goodbye is tambit
[00:19:01] so i'm gonna picture the vet doctor
[00:19:05] saying ciao right as it's bit by the dog
[00:19:07] but that
[00:19:08] he's cursing out this musical beat
[00:19:11] that's playing in the background because
[00:19:12] that's what excited the dog to bite him
[00:19:14] in the first place so
[00:19:15] damn beat tim beat all right guys that's
[00:19:19] it i hope that was fun
[00:19:20] a little bit weird i know some of those
[00:19:22] images and sounds weren't exactly
[00:19:24] the right way to say some of these words
[00:19:26] but it's close enough
[00:19:27] that if you did a little bit of extra
[00:19:29] studying and research on each of those
[00:19:31] languages you would have it down pat
[00:19:33] now again i'm not an expert but that was
[00:19:34] just my two cents and hopefully it
[00:19:36] helped you get a little bit of the way
[00:19:38] towards becoming a polyglot you're
[00:19:40] welcome
[00:19:41] now of course if you want to get better
[00:19:42] at these languages there's tons and tons
[00:19:44] of resources
[00:19:45] one of my favorites is this drops app
[00:19:47] which is actually what i use
[00:19:49] to find a lot of these words drops is a
[00:19:52] fantastic app that i've used to learn
[00:19:54] dutch i'm currently
[00:19:55] using it to learn another language but
[00:19:57] it's super easy to use the
[00:19:59] the ui is beautiful and what's nice is
[00:20:01] they actually have an online visual
[00:20:03] dictionary so if you don't have the app
[00:20:04] on your phone you can actually through
[00:20:06] their website check it out
[00:20:07] and find a lot of these words or
[00:20:10] meanings for any words so
[00:20:12] i actually used a lot of that to quickly
[00:20:13] look up some of these words
[00:20:15] anyways thanks for watching please like
[00:20:18] subscribe
[00:20:19] oh and if anybody can tell me in a
[00:20:21] different language that i didn't mention
[00:20:23] how to say hello and goodbye and a good
[00:20:25] mnemonic for it
[00:20:26] in the comments below the one who gives
[00:20:28] me the most interesting one
[00:20:30] at least one that i don't know or didn't
[00:20:32] know will get a free year subscription
[00:20:34] to drops itself
[00:20:36] so get writing in the comments folks man
[00:20:38] i there's so many
[00:20:39] things i could say for goodbye um but
[00:20:42] i'm just gonna say bye
[00:20:44] in english right i guess i didn't cover
[00:20:45] that one but hello and goodbye is how
[00:20:48] you say hello and goodbye in english
[00:20:49] all right i'm gonna stop talking now i'm
[00:20:51] gonna get destroyed for this video
[00:21:02] you


=== THE IMPOSSIBLE PI MACHINE ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsT5xzdVhA

[00:00:06] [Music]
[00:00:15] [Music]
[00:00:28] um
[00:00:33] about five years ago i attempted this
[00:00:36] memory
[00:00:37] everest pie challenge everest
[00:00:40] pie memory challenge everest matrix pie
[00:00:43] challenge something like that
[00:00:45] anyways i had to memorize ten thousand
[00:00:47] digits of pie
[00:00:48] and then i was quizzed on different
[00:00:50] portions of five
[00:00:52] digit chunks within the ten thousand i
[00:00:54] had to know it forwards and backwards
[00:00:56] i needed to know if you said any five of
[00:00:59] those ten thousands what were the next
[00:01:01] five and the previous five i had to do
[00:01:02] that 50 times
[00:01:04] without mistakes as fast as possible
[00:01:06] guess what
[00:01:07] i failed
[00:01:12] next incorrect
[00:01:17] i wouldn't even say i got pretty close
[00:01:18] in the actual attempt
[00:01:20] i think i got maybe 30 right because as
[00:01:22] soon as you get one wrong
[00:01:23] attempt is over you only get three
[00:01:25] attempts for the day for the record to
[00:01:27] count
[00:01:27] now i believe at that time the record
[00:01:29] was around 16 minutes
[00:01:31] and i believe last year the year before
[00:01:34] it was broken
[00:01:35] and is now at around 14 minutes if you
[00:01:37] do the math
[00:01:38] it's actually not very much time to give
[00:01:41] your answer for all of those
[00:01:42] 50-digit chunks it's a really hard
[00:01:45] record
[00:01:46] it's 10 000 digits but divided in groups
[00:01:48] of five that means that there are
[00:01:50] exactly
[00:01:50] two thousand different five-digit chunks
[00:01:53] that i need to know
[00:01:54] two thousand right so you say one of two
[00:01:56] thousand things i need to know exactly
[00:01:58] where i am
[00:01:58] in this ten thousand digits of pi and
[00:02:00] say what comes next and what comes
[00:02:02] before
[00:02:03] really fast fifty times no mistakes
[00:02:06] now about a year ago actually a year ago
[00:02:09] i did a video where i ate a bunch of
[00:02:10] pizza
[00:02:11] and recited a thousand digits of pie so
[00:02:13] as i was training for that
[00:02:15] and kind of relearning a lot of the
[00:02:16] digits that i had forgotten from five
[00:02:18] years ago
[00:02:19] i relearned the first thousand again and
[00:02:21] through that practice and through that
[00:02:23] video i ended up thinking you know what
[00:02:25] maybe i should keep going so i relearned
[00:02:27] another thousand and another thousand
[00:02:28] and another thousand and before i knew
[00:02:30] it i was pretty close
[00:02:31] to what i used to know which was ten
[00:02:32] thousand digits of pi
[00:02:34] so i said at this point hey we're in
[00:02:36] lockdown
[00:02:37] coved i got nothing to do let me just
[00:02:39] keep going
[00:02:40] let me keep on mastering these digits
[00:02:41] and see if i can break the record
[00:02:43] in the upcoming year so i'd spent hours
[00:02:45] when i would run
[00:02:46] when i would row when i would take a
[00:02:48] shower when i was in bed rocking my
[00:02:50] new infant to sleep i would just be
[00:02:53] reciting
[00:02:53] digits of pie in my mind actually this
[00:02:56] true story
[00:02:56] would put my newborn infant to sleep by
[00:02:59] reciting pie
[00:03:00] i don't know if that's cute or funny but
[00:03:03] anyways the record itself is actually
[00:03:04] kind of
[00:03:05] boring to watch it's just you know me
[00:03:07] sitting there
[00:03:08] judges telling me what numbers you know
[00:03:10] from the 10 000 that i should be
[00:03:12] trying to answer correctly and i thought
[00:03:15] why not try to think of a more
[00:03:17] interesting way
[00:03:18] to demonstrate this feat of memory
[00:03:20] [Music]
[00:03:22] so i teamed up with a company called oat
[00:03:24] foundry they're based in philadelphia
[00:03:26] and they make
[00:03:27] really cool like this split flap
[00:03:30] screen
[00:03:30] basically what it is it's like those old
[00:03:32] boards you'd see at like a train station
[00:03:34] where it
[00:03:35] flaps airports and stuff where it shows
[00:03:37] all the departure times and arrivals but
[00:03:39] they make these
[00:03:40] custom size custom look you can program
[00:03:42] them to do whatever you want
[00:03:43] so that got me thinking what if i could
[00:03:46] have them build me a machine
[00:03:48] that challenges me to do this everest
[00:03:50] memory pie challenge
[00:03:51] so thus the impossible pie machine was
[00:03:54] invented
[00:03:55] now my plan is to do a proper record
[00:03:58] attempt but this is kind of just a
[00:04:00] little intro to tell you a little bit
[00:04:01] about it and to show you how it works
[00:04:03] it's pi day so why not now before we
[00:04:05] dive in and do some demos of what this
[00:04:07] thing can do because it's got a mind of
[00:04:09] its own it can choose
[00:04:10] any of those random five digit sequences
[00:04:12] and test me if
[00:04:13] you're watching this video you want you
[00:04:14] want to learn something you don't want
[00:04:15] to just watch me so
[00:04:17] as i always do in every pie video that
[00:04:19] i've ever done on pi day
[00:04:21] is give you something to walk away with
[00:04:23] and this year it's going to be an extra
[00:04:24] digit of pi
[00:04:25] so most people know 3.14
[00:04:31] i believe in one of my videos in the
[00:04:33] past i said hey
[00:04:34] you want to know a little bit more than
[00:04:36] the average person just remember one
[00:04:38] more digit
[00:04:39] a one 3.141 that's easy anybody can add
[00:04:42] a one
[00:04:43] to what they already know now we're
[00:04:44] going to take it even further we're
[00:04:46] going to add an extra digit to that
[00:04:48] and just so you don't get confused just
[00:04:49] think of 3.14
[00:04:52] the 1 4. what's the next number after
[00:04:54] 14.
[00:04:56] it's 15. all right we're going to do
[00:04:59] five attempts just to see what it's like
[00:05:01] i don't know which ones that this pie
[00:05:03] machine is going to
[00:05:04] choose it has a mind of its own been
[00:05:06] programmed that way
[00:05:07] so what's going to happen is it's gonna
[00:05:09] show me five digits now you can play
[00:05:11] along with me if you refer to this
[00:05:13] crazy page of digits and so it'll show
[00:05:15] me that five digit number
[00:05:16] i'll get like three seconds or so more
[00:05:18] or less to think of which digits come
[00:05:21] after
[00:05:22] immediately and which five digits come
[00:05:24] before so make sure to check me
[00:05:26] although i typically know when i'm right
[00:05:27] or wrong
[00:05:32] so 67702 that is
[00:05:36] okay the next one
[00:05:40] is eight nine eight nine one
[00:05:45] and the one before is nine three three
[00:05:47] one three so eight nine eight
[00:05:49] nine one
[00:05:54] eight nine eight nine one and then nine
[00:05:57] three
[00:05:57] three one three
[00:06:05] all right so zero three zero six eight
[00:06:08] okay i think i got it it's i think the
[00:06:09] next one is zero three eight
[00:06:11] four four still got some time and then
[00:06:15] the one before is going to be
[00:06:18] one four two one five i believe all
[00:06:20] right so
[00:06:21] zero three eight four four zero
[00:06:24] three eight four four
[00:06:28] nice and then one four two one five
[00:06:36] you can't beat me machine you just can't
[00:06:42] let's do another one here
[00:06:46] three zero nine nine two three zero nine
[00:06:48] nine two
[00:06:49] three zero nine nine two
[00:06:54] yeah the next one is going to be
[00:06:59] four four eight eight nine
[00:07:08] and eight eight eight one nine
[00:07:11] nine four
[00:07:15] nice i have to search for that one all
[00:07:17] right let's do another one here
[00:07:21] zero nine nine three nine
[00:07:31] the next one is three six one zero three
[00:07:36] three six one zero three
[00:07:42] nice and the one before is gonna be nine
[00:07:45] three six two zero
[00:07:47] nine five six two zero
[00:07:52] all right here we go last one here
[00:07:55] four one two zero zero four one two zero
[00:07:58] zero
[00:07:59] the next one is six five nine
[00:08:02] seven five i believe
[00:08:05] six five six six five nine seven five
[00:08:09] and the one before is going to be
[00:08:11] the five one zero one two so six
[00:08:14] five nine seven five
[00:08:19] nice and then five one zero one two
[00:08:27] ain't got nothing on me all right guys
[00:08:31] that's it for this video please
[00:08:32] subscribe and stay tuned because on this
[00:08:35] channel i'll be doing some form
[00:08:37] of attempt for this record in the near
[00:08:39] future

[00:08:51] it's going to be exciting i feel really
[00:08:52] good about it i've been training really
[00:08:54] hard for it but in the meantime check
[00:08:55] out these guys oat foundry

[00:09:07] don't forget to eat some pie
[00:09:09] whether it's like an apple pie or a
[00:09:10] pizza pie i don't care just eat some pie
[00:09:13] and don't forget that extra digit 3.1415
[00:09:17] i'm out

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIZ0qtckQh8

[00:00:03] [Music]
[00:00:06] this video
[00:00:07] we're going to learn how to memorize the
[00:00:10] grade 1
[00:00:11] braille system let's dive right in
[00:00:15] [Music]
[00:00:31] welcome back to another video guys my
[00:00:33] name is nelson delos if you don't know
[00:00:34] me i'm a four-time usa memory champion
[00:00:37] so
[00:00:37] i know a thing or two about how to
[00:00:39] memorize things quickly
[00:00:40] and i love memorizing new things braille
[00:00:42] has always been super fascinating to me
[00:00:45] i've always wondered how it works and if
[00:00:47] i could learn it pretty quick
[00:00:48] not that i need it i'm not visually
[00:00:50] impaired but i wonder if i could learn
[00:00:52] it so then i could then teach it
[00:00:53] to those of you who actually need it and
[00:00:55] who need to learn it quick
[00:00:57] so in this video i'm going to teach you
[00:00:58] how to memorize
[00:01:00] the alphabet in braille basically the
[00:01:02] approach that i took as a memory
[00:01:04] champion to encode this information
[00:01:06] in my head as quick as possible i want
[00:01:08] to be sensitive to the people who
[00:01:09] actually
[00:01:10] can't see this video but who can hear it
[00:01:12] so as best as i can
[00:01:14] i will try to describe what i'm doing
[00:01:16] with these
[00:01:17] tennis balls and muffin tins so that
[00:01:19] people who can only hear this
[00:01:21] know exactly how to memorize it just the
[00:01:23] same as those of you that can watch this
[00:01:25] video but first but first but first
[00:01:27] i think a little bit of history is an
[00:01:28] order so back in the early 1800s there
[00:01:32] was this kid
[00:01:32] lewis braille and he lost his eyesight
[00:01:35] in some kind of accident and
[00:01:37] realized he needed some way to
[00:01:39] communicate so he actually
[00:01:41] came up with a more efficient system off
[00:01:43] of something that already existed called
[00:01:45] night writing not that kind which was
[00:01:48] basically a military
[00:01:50] tactile code that had come up as a
[00:01:52] response from napoleon who wanted
[00:01:54] his soldiers to have a means to
[00:01:55] communicate at night when they couldn't
[00:01:57] see anything
[00:01:58] lewis braille i guess knew it and built
[00:02:00] off of it and created something that was
[00:02:02] way more efficient
[00:02:03] called the braille system way to go
[00:02:06] lewis
[00:02:09] alright so the basics of braille are
[00:02:11] this braille is based off of these three
[00:02:13] by two grids three rows
[00:02:15] two columns and there are six cells we
[00:02:17] call them in these grids
[00:02:18] and in terms of these cells they can
[00:02:20] either be raised or not raised
[00:02:22] there are 64 possible combinations
[00:02:24] including a configuration where none of
[00:02:25] them are raised and
[00:02:26] out of those you can make the alphabet
[00:02:28] so for those of you that can't see what
[00:02:30] i'm showing you here
[00:02:31] just know the numbering of all these
[00:02:32] cells one two three down the first
[00:02:34] column four five six down
[00:02:36] the second column grade one braille is
[00:02:37] actually super simple
[00:02:39] because as long as you know the
[00:02:40] configurations for letters a
[00:02:42] through j basically the first ten
[00:02:44] letters you know how to do the rest of
[00:02:46] the alphabet because they're based off
[00:02:47] of those with minor adjustments
[00:02:49] and even the numbers are based on those
[00:02:51] first configurations for letters
[00:02:53] so if we can get those first 10 in our
[00:02:55] head we essentially have it all
[00:02:56] memorized
[00:02:57] anybody can memorize 10 things right yep
[00:03:00] all right
[00:03:00] so we just need one of these trays we
[00:03:02] don't need all these balls
[00:03:04] and in fact the first 10 letters a
[00:03:07] through j
[00:03:08] it's only going to be the top four cells
[00:03:11] so cells
[00:03:12] one two four and five and we're just
[00:03:15] gonna memorize
[00:03:16] a short little story and each of the ten
[00:03:19] letters will represent kind of a moment
[00:03:20] in the story or
[00:03:21] a word in the story and hopefully it
[00:03:24] helps you remember the configuration
[00:03:26] of the raised or not raised cells
[00:03:29] so the story goes we start with an apple
[00:03:32] and suddenly a baseball bat comes out of
[00:03:33] nowhere and
[00:03:34] whacks this apple out of the way after
[00:03:36] that action you go into your car and you
[00:03:38] have to take a detour
[00:03:40] and exit onto the highway or whatever it
[00:03:42] is as you're driving you realize that
[00:03:44] you're out of fuel
[00:03:45] and you got to get some gas you go back
[00:03:47] to your house or your home
[00:03:49] with a little chimney there and you go
[00:03:50] inside and you have a nice delicious ice
[00:03:52] cream you feel like a big fat slob so
[00:03:55] you go for a jog
[00:03:56] that's it now if you noticed a which was
[00:03:59] the apple
[00:04:00] was just up in this top left corner and
[00:04:02] that's what a is
[00:04:03] it's just a raised cell one next we had
[00:04:06] b
[00:04:07] which was a bat which was a vertical bat
[00:04:09] and that actually takes up
[00:04:10] cells one and two the letter c was a car
[00:04:14] and you can imagine those two car wheels
[00:04:16] kind of horizontal
[00:04:18] that's the top left cell one and the top
[00:04:21] right cell
[00:04:22] four now d made a detour which kind of
[00:04:24] makes this angle shape going
[00:04:25] up and then left and that takes up cells
[00:04:28] one four and five
[00:04:30] next we had to exit e and that was in
[00:04:32] the direction of a northwest
[00:04:34] arrow which takes up cells one and five
[00:04:37] then we needed fuel which is an f and
[00:04:39] this literally looks like an
[00:04:41] f shape which is cells one two and four
[00:04:44] we had to get a gas canister which is
[00:04:46] kind of the square object which is
[00:04:47] perfect because
[00:04:48] it's actually all four of the top cells
[00:04:51] raised which is one two
[00:04:53] four and five next was our house or home
[00:04:56] and remember that little chimney and
[00:04:57] actually it's the letter h it kind of
[00:04:59] looks like an h which is cells
[00:05:00] one two and five then we got some
[00:05:03] delicious ice cream which was kind of
[00:05:04] the opposite of
[00:05:05] e in the other direction basically cells
[00:05:08] two and four and then finally the last
[00:05:10] one was j
[00:05:11] it kind of looks like a backwards l or
[00:05:13] if you thought of the guy
[00:05:14] running his kind of tail leg was kicking
[00:05:16] out from behind him
[00:05:18] kind of looks like this configuration
[00:05:19] which is cells two
[00:05:21] four and five and that's it you have the
[00:05:23] first 10 letters of the alphabet and
[00:05:24] with those
[00:05:25] you can actually get all the rest of the
[00:05:27] letters
[00:05:29] that is it my friends nelson what about
[00:05:32] the other letters
[00:05:33] well here's the beauty of braille so the
[00:05:35] next ten letters k
[00:05:36] through t are the exact same
[00:05:39] representations as a through j
[00:05:40] except you have an extra cell raised in
[00:05:42] position 3. so
[00:05:44] k for example is just a but with the
[00:05:45] added cell 3 raised
[00:05:48] b is the same as l c is the same as m
[00:05:52] and so on but just with that added cell
[00:05:55] three raised
[00:05:58] now that'll take you through the next
[00:05:59] ten letters k through t what about the
[00:06:01] remaining
[00:06:02] six letters after that u through z so
[00:06:04] get this u through
[00:06:06] z are the exact same as a b and c and so
[00:06:08] on just with the cells three
[00:06:09] and six raised so u is a but with those
[00:06:12] extra cells three and six
[00:06:14] and so on you get the idea the one
[00:06:16] exception is w
[00:06:17] apparently the french hated the letter
[00:06:19] so they had to add it later and it gets
[00:06:20] its own representation
[00:06:21] cells 2 4 5 and 6. basically it just
[00:06:24] looks like a sideways w
[00:06:26] what about numbers well 0 through 9 it
[00:06:28] uses the same cell configurations as a
[00:06:30] through j
[00:06:31] where 1 is the same as a 2 is b 3 is c
[00:06:34] and so on and then j is 0 at the end now
[00:06:37] how do you tell if you're dealing with a
[00:06:38] number or a letter
[00:06:39] well if you get this configuration you
[00:06:42] know that the next thing that's going to
[00:06:43] come up
[00:06:44] is a number not a letter so you can
[00:06:45] differentiate and then when you get this
[00:06:47] configuration you know that it's going
[00:06:49] to return back to being letters
[00:06:51] so for switching to numbers you need to
[00:06:53] have cells three
[00:06:54] four five and six raised and then to
[00:06:56] switch back to letters it's just cells
[00:06:58] five and six
[00:06:59] that's it really that's all it is guys
[00:07:02] one thing you want to keep in mind right
[00:07:03] because
[00:07:04] knowing those 10 letters is great right
[00:07:06] you know a through j
[00:07:07] but you want to be quick at being able
[00:07:09] to tell what the other ones are
[00:07:10] in reference to those 10 that you
[00:07:12] already know knowing that a
[00:07:14] maps to k maps to u just with the extra
[00:07:17] raised cell
[00:07:18] in three or three and six is super
[00:07:21] useful because
[00:07:22] essentially all you're doing is if ever
[00:07:23] you see that cell
[00:07:25] three is raised you know it's in that
[00:07:26] second set of letters from k
[00:07:28] to t and if you see that both cells 3
[00:07:30] and 6 are raised
[00:07:32] then you know it's u through z except
[00:07:34] for w which is its own weird bastard
[00:07:36] case
[00:07:36] right so to do that here's an easy way
[00:07:39] we know our story we have those
[00:07:41] 10 things the apple the bat the car all
[00:07:43] that stuff
[00:07:44] what if we just add a little mnemonic to
[00:07:46] that story that helps us remember what a
[00:07:48] maps to what b maps to okay i've done it
[00:07:51] for you
[00:07:52] you're welcome a is an apple if you can
[00:07:54] remember that this a
[00:07:56] goes to ak university meaning i don't
[00:07:59] know there's a university that
[00:08:01] is just got students that are in the
[00:08:03] shape of the letter
[00:08:04] k there's a bunch of k's running around
[00:08:07] the university
[00:08:08] it's okay university
[00:08:13] the b is a bat imagine that the bat
[00:08:16] loves bees all right so b love b
[00:08:20] lv b maps to l maps to v the next one is
[00:08:23] car
[00:08:24] so you have cmx i think of like a car
[00:08:27] in america at least we have this place
[00:08:29] called carmax where you can sell
[00:08:31] your cars think of c max car max the
[00:08:34] next one was
[00:08:34] detour and d maps to n maps to y so i
[00:08:37] have
[00:08:38] deny denied so imagine taking this
[00:08:40] detour and you kind of get denied maybe
[00:08:42] you try to get
[00:08:43] onto this highway right to the exit but
[00:08:45] you get denied then you have an exit e
[00:08:46] maps to o maps to z
[00:08:48] so i have like this eos sound there so
[00:08:51] maybe
[00:08:51] that's like e u e-z-e-o-z instead of
[00:08:54] easy
[00:08:55] but i don't know maybe the exit is the
[00:08:56] easy way out
[00:08:58] stupid now the rest of these
[00:09:00] associations are from the first set or
[00:09:01] the second so
[00:09:02] f maps to p so i can imagine when i'm
[00:09:05] filling up my fuel
[00:09:06] right fuel was f i filler up
[00:09:09] so that p sound f p so f maps to p for
[00:09:12] the gas
[00:09:12] canister we have g mapping to q so you
[00:09:15] can just remember gq
[00:09:16] maybe this plastered on the front of
[00:09:18] this gas canister
[00:09:20] is a gq magazine house h
[00:09:23] maps to r so i think of like hair hr so
[00:09:26] maybe this house has a bunch of hair
[00:09:28] on top of its roof or something i maps
[00:09:30] to s so that's like
[00:09:31] is so maybe it's like is cream instead
[00:09:34] of ice cream and then finally
[00:09:36] j maps to t so i think of like a jet so
[00:09:39] imagine the guy running going for a jog
[00:09:41] after he's done jogging he jets off like
[00:09:44] super fast and that's it so now if i say
[00:09:47] you know
[00:09:47] what's k you know that k maps to a you
[00:09:50] know also u
[00:09:52] they're the same but k is from that
[00:09:53] second set so it looks like a but it has
[00:09:55] that raised
[00:09:56] cell three if i talk about p right i
[00:09:59] know let's fill her
[00:10:00] up right fill her up the car with fuel
[00:10:03] so that was f so f looked like an f but
[00:10:06] now it's
[00:10:06] got that extra cell raised three because
[00:10:08] it's p
[00:10:11] all right so let's do some examples i'm
[00:10:12] gonna have four muffin tins here with
[00:10:14] some different configurations of tennis
[00:10:16] balls
[00:10:16] and we're gonna try to read through
[00:10:19] braille
[00:10:20] what this four-letter word is saying for
[00:10:22] those of you that can't see this i'll
[00:10:23] describe
[00:10:24] what cells are raised in each of the
[00:10:26] four muffin tins let's go
[00:10:34] okay so for those of you that can't see
[00:10:36] this the first character has
[00:10:38] cells one raised the second has
[00:10:41] cells one two three and four raised the
[00:10:44] third letter
[00:10:45] has cells one and five raised
[00:10:48] and then the final letter has cells one
[00:10:51] three
[00:10:52] four and six raised i'll give you a
[00:10:54] second to try and figure out what that
[00:10:55] reads as
[00:10:58] that's apex a-p-e-x
[00:11:04] our next word here starts with one
[00:11:07] and four the second letter is cells
[00:11:11] one the third is cells two three and
[00:11:14] four
[00:11:14] and then the final letter is cells one
[00:11:17] two
[00:11:18] and five what does that read as
[00:11:22] it's cash all right let's do one more
[00:11:25] for good measure
[00:11:26] so the first letter is cells
[00:11:29] three four five six second letter is
[00:11:32] cells
[00:11:33] one the third letter is cells five and
[00:11:36] six
[00:11:36] and then the fourth letter is cells two
[00:11:39] four five and six
[00:11:40] what does that read as
[00:11:43] well it was a trick so really what this
[00:11:46] reads as is
[00:11:47] one w you got me
[00:11:50] that's it guys hope you enjoyed this
[00:11:51] video i hope this was useful i really i
[00:11:53] know this is fun to learn but there's a
[00:11:55] real serious use case here i hope those
[00:11:57] of you that are watching that actually
[00:11:58] need it
[00:11:59] actually learned it and this video was
[00:12:01] very helpful for you

[00:12:23] know yet uh maybe playing some video
[00:12:24] games maybe building some memory palaces
[00:12:27] both with video games and not maybe even
[00:12:29] memorizing
[00:12:30] and working on some of my projects you
[00:12:32] can kind of get a little more of a
[00:12:34] glimpse inside of what i do when this

[00:01:50] which is called everest memory
[00:01:52] masterclass why everest
[00:01:54] if you don't know you've seen some of my
[00:01:56] videos i climb i've been on everest
[00:01:58] three times
[00:01:59] so mountain climbing means something to

[00:02:02] with mountains
[00:02:03] no but there's a relationship right
[00:02:05] everest is the biggest most prominent
[00:02:07] peak
[00:02:08] and i want you guys to have a peak
[00:02:10] memory
[00:02:11] right i want you to be able to get to
[00:02:12] the top top
[00:02:14] of your memory game it's the highest
[00:02:16] peak see what i'm going for there
[00:02:17] anyways the course is launching february
[00:02:19] 1st there's a limited amount of spaces
[00:02:21] i'm trying to limit it so it can be
[00:02:23] a really intimate setting you get access
[00:02:25] to me and my videos
[00:02:27] and my bonus material think of what you
[00:02:29] see on this channel right is
[00:02:30] is me having fun with memory techniques
[00:02:32] i teach you guys a little bit
[00:02:34] but there is a lot more and on youtube
[00:02:36] it's not really structured it's just
[00:02:37] like here's a tip there
[00:02:38] there's another tip here's a fun video
[00:02:40] in my course you'll get from
[00:02:42] average memory or or below average
[00:02:44] memory to
[00:02:45] a champion caliber memory but that's not
[00:02:48] it i'm not trying to train you guys to
[00:02:49] become
[00:02:50] memory champions like me at least in the
[00:02:52] competition setting i'm training you
[00:02:53] guys to be
[00:02:54] a memory champion for life so that you
[00:02:57] have mastery over these memory
[00:02:58] techniques
[00:02:59] and can apply them to your everyday life
[00:03:01] in a practical way

=== The 3 "C"s for Rapid Language Learning (do apps help?) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03LpSrpK69A

[00:00:00] happy new year guys welcome to 2021
[00:00:04] hopefully not a dumpster fire of a year
[00:00:06] and i am excited to announce that
[00:00:09] language learning is back on this
[00:00:11] channel for this year
[00:00:13] last year was kind of quiet i kind of
[00:00:15] took a little hiatus after 2019
[00:00:17] i spent the year learning dutch and 2020
[00:00:21] to be honest obviously a lot went on i
[00:00:23] had other projects
[00:00:24] and i actually devoted most of that year
[00:00:26] to memorizing
[00:00:28] a different kind of language numbers
[00:00:30] you'll learn about that later that's
[00:00:32] for another video but for now we're
[00:00:33] talking about language and i'm excited
[00:00:35] to announce that this year again i'll be
[00:00:37] partnering with
[00:00:38] drops the drops app which i use to help
[00:00:41] myself
[00:00:41] get to basic conversational fluency in
[00:00:44] dutch so you can expect a lot more
[00:00:45] content coming up on how i learn
[00:00:47] languages tips to learn languages
[00:00:49] things i try to avoid and the like now
[00:00:51] today is exciting because it's the first
[00:00:52] of the year
[00:00:53] drops always has this awesome really fun
[00:00:56] challenge
[00:00:57] for 90 days it's called 90 days with
[00:00:59] drops challenge i did this back in 2019
[00:01:01] with dutch
[00:01:02] where i tried to learn all the words on
[00:01:04] the app in dutch
[00:01:06] 2500 words in the 90 days i was
[00:01:09] successful it was a good time i used my
[00:01:10] memory techniques i was also very
[00:01:12] exhausted by the end of it but i plan on
[00:01:14] participating again in this 90 day
[00:01:16] challenge
[00:01:16] to kind of re-immerse myself in the
[00:01:19] dutch that i had learned
[00:01:20] not that i've forgotten it but i have
[00:01:22] put it to the side i want to get back
[00:01:24] into it
[00:01:25] and i want to kind of continue on my
[00:01:26] journey because
[00:01:28] being fluent never ends when are you
[00:01:30] actually fluent right
[00:01:32] it's hard to measure that right depends
[00:01:34] on what you mean by fluency
[00:01:35] to me i don't think i'm quite there yet
[00:01:37] i'd like to be able to take my
[00:01:38] conversations further i feel very
[00:01:40] confident in where i've come
[00:01:41] but there's a lot more that i'd like to
[00:01:43] accomplish with it so for these 90 days
[00:01:45] and i encourage you guys to join along
[00:01:47] with me
[00:01:47] and do the challenge for 90 days try to
[00:01:50] play five minutes just five minutes on
[00:01:53] this drops app
[00:01:54] in a language of your choice and learn
[00:01:56] some new words learn some new vocabulary
[00:01:59] in that target language that you've
[00:02:00] always wanted to learn for 90 days
[00:02:02] be as consistent as you can over those
[00:02:04] 90 days no missed days that's key
[00:02:07] and see what you get out of it by the
[00:02:08] end of the 90 days now a little sneak
[00:02:10] peek i shouldn't be saying this but
[00:02:12] while i'm going to be maintaining my
[00:02:13] dutch through this 90 day challenge
[00:02:14] again
[00:02:15] i'm also actually secretly going to be
[00:02:17] learning a new language and i can't
[00:02:18] quite announce it yet
[00:02:20] but if you know me you probably have an
[00:02:21] idea what it's going to be i'm not going
[00:02:23] to say when but eventually i'll announce
[00:02:24] it and
[00:02:25] it's going to be super interesting the
[00:02:26] whole project i have lined up for the
[00:02:27] later half of the year
[00:02:29] related to that language is going to be
[00:02:30] super exciting and also
[00:02:32] another really meaningful thing for me
[00:02:35] in my life
[00:02:36] so i'm excited about that now i just
[00:02:38] don't want to announce a challenge and
[00:02:39] dump it on you guys and then leave you
[00:02:41] dry
[00:02:41] and do your thing no i want to give you
[00:02:43] some tips that's what this channel is
[00:02:45] all about
[00:02:45] so one of the things i love about the
[00:02:48] drops app a lot of people ask me well
[00:02:50] do you like learning languages with an
[00:02:51] app will drops make you fluent
[00:02:54] and the answer is no not really but it
[00:02:57] will help
[00:02:58] and here's how all right so
[00:03:01] for me i really believe that learning a
[00:03:03] language quickly
[00:03:04] and efficiently comes with these three
[00:03:07] foundational c's
[00:03:10] the first c is core vocabulary
[00:03:13] i think to really dive into a language
[00:03:15] and really get the
[00:03:16] quickest bang for your buck is to learn
[00:03:19] a large set of vocabulary
[00:03:21] from the start now i'll be the first to
[00:03:23] say that
[00:03:24] learning a language and becoming
[00:03:25] conversationally fluent is
[00:03:27] not entirely memorizing vocab that's of
[00:03:30] course
[00:03:31] absurd you can't get by just having
[00:03:33] memorized
[00:03:34] say a thousand words it'll help if you
[00:03:37] know a thousand words
[00:03:38] you'll be able to pick up pieces and
[00:03:40] kind of get a gist of what's being said
[00:03:42] or written
[00:03:43] or whatnot but i do think a great place
[00:03:45] to start is with learning vocab
[00:03:47] you gotta know the words to speak the
[00:03:49] language right you gotta know phrases
[00:03:50] you gotta know words there's no way
[00:03:52] around it
[00:03:54] the second c is consistency and i think
[00:03:56] this might actually be the most
[00:03:58] important at least for me if i don't
[00:04:01] consistently
[00:04:02] practice or work on my language learning
[00:04:05] i don't get very far and what i love
[00:04:07] about the drops app is that it's so
[00:04:09] easy to just open up play your five
[00:04:12] minutes
[00:04:13] it's kind of like a gamified experience
[00:04:15] and then you're done for the day
[00:04:17] now i don't think that just playing five
[00:04:19] minutes a day
[00:04:20] will get you to your goal but that's not
[00:04:22] the point here the point is to be
[00:04:24] consistent
[00:04:24] because i think if you build this habit
[00:04:26] of constantly working
[00:04:28] and consistently working on your
[00:04:30] language learning every day
[00:04:31] you'll eventually get to a point where
[00:04:33] you maybe do that but you also say you
[00:04:34] know what
[00:04:35] i've come this far maybe i want to pick
[00:04:38] up a grammar book
[00:04:39] or maybe i want to work with a tutor
[00:04:41] just for an extra half hour or a week
[00:04:43] something like that and those
[00:04:44] incremental kind of decisions
[00:04:46] which build off of your consistency
[00:04:48] behavior with the app
[00:04:49] that is what leads to long-term language
[00:04:51] learning so in a way the app is kind of
[00:04:53] a
[00:04:54] little habit hacker to get you started a
[00:04:56] little amuse-bouche
[00:04:58] yes the third c
[00:05:02] is confidence and that can mean a lot of
[00:05:04] things confidence in how you speak
[00:05:06] confidence and
[00:05:08] knowing what you know or just confidence
[00:05:10] and
[00:05:11] kind of barreling yourself forward in
[00:05:13] this language learning process
[00:05:14] and i think when you learn these amount
[00:05:17] of words and you do
[00:05:18] have the consistency that kind of
[00:05:20] snowballs into the confidence that you
[00:05:22] need to say hey
[00:05:23] i'm actually making progress in this
[00:05:25] language i'm going to keep going
[00:05:27] and then that feeds itself you get more
[00:05:29] confidence you become more
[00:05:30] consistent you learn more vocab and it's
[00:05:33] just kind of this ever
[00:05:34] building snowball effect which
[00:05:36] eventually will lead you to a position
[00:05:37] where you say hey
[00:05:39] i actually know a lot of this language
[00:05:40] and i can maybe even take it to the next
[00:05:42] level i feel confident
[00:05:44] in doing that and finally this is kind
[00:05:47] of like a fourth c
[00:05:49] is challenge i think to really push
[00:05:51] yourself and to make progress
[00:05:52] in some kind of goal you have there
[00:05:54] needs to be a little bit of the
[00:05:56] challenge
[00:05:56] some think to hold you accountable right
[00:05:58] if you find it too easy
[00:06:00] you're probably not gonna be motivated
[00:06:01] to keep doing it if it's too hard then
[00:06:03] you're probably gonna get bored of it or
[00:06:05] have tremendous anxiety and then you
[00:06:07] won't even get started or you'll stop
[00:06:09] before you've even begun so having a
[00:06:10] good
[00:06:11] kind of friendly little nudge of a
[00:06:13] challenge i think is great to kind of
[00:06:15] helping you learn a language in my
[00:06:17] position here the challenge
[00:06:18] obviously is the 90 day challenge but
[00:06:20] also i want to be able to speak fluently
[00:06:22] with my mother
[00:06:23] that that was goal number one and that's
[00:06:25] what keeps driving me that's my
[00:06:27] motivation and
[00:06:28] it keeps challenging me because my mom
[00:06:30] can speak dutch
[00:06:31] you know she's very understanding she'll
[00:06:33] speak slowly to me she'll and
[00:06:35] she'll kind of allow for my mistakes and
[00:06:37] things like that but i don't want that i
[00:06:39] want her
[00:06:40] to speak as if i was just another native
[00:06:42] someone in her family who speaks the
[00:06:44] language with her who she grew up with
[00:06:46] i guess we did grow up together that's
[00:06:48] weird to think all right so to recap the
[00:06:49] three foundational c's to
[00:06:51] effective and rapid language learning
[00:06:54] are
[00:06:54] core vocab consistency and confidence
[00:06:58] and then an extra little thing challenge
[00:07:00] if you can incorporate that into your
[00:07:01] day-to-day
[00:07:02] kind of language learning process
[00:07:03] whatever that may be
[00:07:05] you're going to be on your way to
[00:07:06] actually making progress and learning
[00:07:08] this language
[00:07:09] and many of us know we've spent a lot of
[00:07:12] time
[00:07:12] learning languages without actually
[00:07:14] learning language think high school
[00:07:16] french
[00:07:17] or spanish yeah all right guys thanks so
[00:07:20] much for watching that's it for this
[00:07:21] video i do want to mention that if you
[00:07:23] do want to opt into this challenge
[00:07:26] through the duration of the challenge in
[00:07:27] 90 days if you use the discount code in
[00:07:29] the description below you'll get 50
[00:07:31] off of the app which i think is a steal
[00:07:34] i'll also be giving away one
[00:07:36] free membership to the person who
[00:07:38] comments in the description
[00:07:39] one of the most creative ways that they
[00:07:42] learned
[00:07:43] a word in a language it could be
[00:07:44] anything i just want to see what you
[00:07:46] guys come up with what you've used in
[00:07:47] the past and
[00:07:48] whichever one i find the most amusing
[00:07:50] slash interesting slash
[00:07:51] memorable we'll get that free drops app

=== I made a SUPER MARIO 64 memory palace ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdomZWQvy-U

[00:00:00] what's up guys welcome to another video
[00:00:02] my name is nelson
[00:00:03] i'm a four-time usa memory champion and
[00:00:05] today we're gonna play a little nintendo
[00:00:07] 64.
[00:00:08] super mario 64 to be exact
[00:00:16] [Music]
[00:00:28] so
[00:00:30] one of my favorite games of all time
[00:00:33] it just reminds me of my younger years
[00:00:36] am i dating myself
[00:00:37] probably whatever um but we're going to
[00:00:39] be using this
[00:00:40] fantastically beautiful controller cut
[00:00:43] it with this thing
[00:00:44] what are we doing inside of super mario
[00:00:46] 64. well
[00:00:48] here's the plan i've been working on
[00:00:50] this project since
[00:00:51] about march earlier this year had a lot
[00:00:53] of time on my hands
[00:00:55] i'm sure you know why and i've been
[00:00:58] working on this big memory project
[00:00:59] it's almost done i'm almost ready to
[00:01:01] perform it i just have a thousand more
[00:01:03] digits to memorize
[00:01:04] for this thing and i gotta say i've used
[00:01:08] up quite a lot of my
[00:01:09] memory palaces i'm running dry
[00:01:13] so i need a new one and i figured why
[00:01:15] not use something that's fun
[00:01:16] different that means something to me
[00:01:20] super mario 64. so things will be
[00:01:22] interesting for you guys to see
[00:01:23] how i take a large amount of data and
[00:01:26] come up with a memory palace on the fly
[00:01:28] as i go
[00:01:29] and memorize all that information i
[00:01:32] haven't seen the thousand digits yet so
[00:01:33] i'm going to learn them here in this
[00:01:34] video
[00:01:35] while you watch now if that wasn't
[00:01:37] enough let's add a little element of
[00:01:40] challenge here i was thinking maybe i
[00:01:41] could try to beat the game
[00:01:43] at the same time give myself about an
[00:01:45] hour to beat the whole game
[00:01:47] and memorize all 1000 digits
[00:01:50] inside of super mario 64. now i know
[00:01:53] some people can beat this game in just
[00:01:55] minutes with zero stars one star but i'm
[00:01:58] gonna try to beat it with 16 star which
[00:02:00] is kind of the
[00:02:01] the default speed running amount of
[00:02:03] stars people go for
[00:02:05] my personal best it's not very good it's
[00:02:07] been around 30 minutes
[00:02:08] so i think 30 minutes plus stopping and
[00:02:11] going memorizing stuff memorizing a
[00:02:13] thousand digits
[00:02:14] i think pushing for an hour would be a
[00:02:16] good challenge so
[00:02:17] let's get into it all right one thing i
[00:02:20] realized that maybe
[00:02:21] a lot of you viewers don't know about is
[00:02:23] what is a memory palace so i've actually
[00:02:26] done a bunch of videos
[00:02:27] i'll link to one up here just so you
[00:02:29] have that but if you search my channel
[00:02:31] you'll find tons of videos explaining
[00:02:33] or using a memory palace but in short
[00:02:35] just so we have it here in this video
[00:02:37] a memory palace is basically a place
[00:02:39] that you use
[00:02:41] typically it's some place that you know
[00:02:42] very well like your house
[00:02:44] or the school you went to growing up or
[00:02:47] your
[00:02:48] significant other's apartment whatever
[00:02:50] and you place images for things you're
[00:02:51] memorizing along a path through that
[00:02:53] space
[00:02:54] the idea being that when you want to
[00:02:55] recall that information all you have to
[00:02:56] do is think back
[00:02:58] on that place go through it traverse it
[00:03:00] through your mind
[00:03:01] and pick up the images for what you
[00:03:02] memorized in the place so what i'll be
[00:03:05] doing in this video
[00:03:06] is instead of using a real place that
[00:03:08] i'm imagining i'll be using a fictional
[00:03:10] place that exists
[00:03:11] within this nintendo 64 video game world
[00:03:14] which is totally reasonable i know the
[00:03:17] place very well
[00:03:18] i spent my childhood playing the game
[00:03:20] for hours
[00:03:21] so it's familiar to me it's a 3d space
[00:03:24] so why not and what i'll be doing is
[00:03:27] turning
[00:03:28] the numbers that i need to memorize into
[00:03:30] pictures we'll talk about that later
[00:03:32] i'm placing them along paths through
[00:03:34] this map of the super mario 64 world
[00:03:37] okay back to the video okay so i think
[00:03:40] the first thing i need to do
[00:03:41] is kind of map out what i'm gonna do so
[00:03:44] i have a thousand digits
[00:03:48] and i basically need the way the way i
[00:03:51] have these numbers separated is
[00:03:52] basically every five digits is one image
[00:03:55] for me
[00:03:55] the first three are a person and the
[00:03:58] last three
[00:03:59] are an object or person sometimes so
[00:04:02] that middle digit
[00:04:03] actually overlaps and i do that on
[00:04:04] purpose because
[00:04:06] in the case that i forget maybe either
[00:04:09] the first part or the last part if i can
[00:04:10] get that middle digit then it sometimes
[00:04:12] helps me remember one or the other
[00:04:14] so a thousand digits every five digits
[00:04:16] is one image
[00:04:17] that means i need 200 locations i
[00:04:20] figured
[00:04:22] while i'm beating the game kind of as i
[00:04:24] go
[00:04:25] i'm gonna try to break up the path that
[00:04:27] i take into segments of 10 locations
[00:04:30] so i need 20 sets of 10 locations
[00:04:34] and each of those 10 locations will
[00:04:36] store 50 digits
[00:04:38] so what will be nice is i could use
[00:04:40] parts of the castle
[00:04:42] maybe even certain levels as i move
[00:04:44] through them that way they're nicely
[00:04:45] contained in certain pockets of the
[00:04:47] castle and the game itself so let's get
[00:04:49] into the game let me kind of before i
[00:04:51] even start
[00:04:51] trying to beat the game uh just map it
[00:04:54] out first
[00:04:55] we're not gonna start the timer yet okay
[00:04:56] so i think what makes the most sense is
[00:04:58] to model my
[00:05:00] pathway my memory palace route after the
[00:05:02] actual
[00:05:03] path i'm gonna take to beat the game
[00:05:05] which i know pretty well because
[00:05:06] remember
[00:05:07] the best memory palaces are the ones
[00:05:09] that you know very well
[00:05:10] and the order in which you go through it
[00:05:12] should make sense too i don't want to
[00:05:13] memorize anything extra remember i'm
[00:05:16] doing 20 sets of 10 locations
[00:05:18] each 10 locations 5 digits each that's
[00:05:21] 50 digits
[00:05:22] per area times 20 that's the thousand
[00:05:24] digits so of my 20 locations
[00:05:27] the first will be the outside you go
[00:05:28] into the castle maybe a little bit of
[00:05:30] the lobby
[00:05:30] then we go to the left we go into the
[00:05:32] first kind of
[00:05:34] level area called the bomb battlefield
[00:05:37] then typically i go to the next
[00:05:39] available level once you have that first
[00:05:41] star
[00:05:41] which is womp's fortress then i need a
[00:05:44] couple more stars i go to
[00:05:45] cold cold mountain the snowy place and
[00:05:47] then once i'm there i'll have enough
[00:05:49] stars to go to the first bowser boss
[00:05:51] over at his level
[00:05:52] after i beat bowser i can go into the
[00:05:54] basement and that little pathway there
[00:05:56] through the halls there could be its own
[00:05:58] memory palace portion as well then i go
[00:06:00] into the lava level
[00:06:01] that'll be another one then i go to the
[00:06:03] sands level hazy maze cave one then i go
[00:06:05] into the water world
[00:06:07] let's start with that the first 10 that
[00:06:10] way it's
[00:06:10] half it's 500 digits and maybe i'll just
[00:06:12] figure it out from there i don't know
[00:06:14] let's see how we go let's see how we go
[00:06:23] all right longest intro ever so while
[00:06:26] this is going
[00:06:27] you notice here i have actually all of
[00:06:29] my
[00:06:30] numbers ready to go and beneath them i
[00:06:34] have
[00:06:34] actually all of the images preset i've
[00:06:36] gone through and converted
[00:06:38] all those numbers to images so actually
[00:06:40] what i'm just going to be looking at
[00:06:42] are the images that i have
[00:06:45] and memorizing those because i can
[00:06:46] always translate them back to numbers
[00:06:48] for those of you wondering i have a
[00:06:49] really complicated system for
[00:06:51] memorizing numbers it's quite advanced
[00:06:53] um you can see it in this video
[00:06:55] if you want to learn more but uh the
[00:06:57] point is is
[00:06:58] instead of numbers i see pictures of
[00:07:00] people and things it's a lot easier to
[00:07:02] remember that way
[00:07:05] all right so here we are um and i have
[00:07:07] my first 10 images
[00:07:09] that i'm going to put there and
[00:07:12] i guess i should just kind of map this
[00:07:14] out so i guess where i start
[00:07:16] that's the first location right here
[00:07:19] yeah
[00:07:20] then i'm gonna come here to this sign
[00:07:24] then maybe here that's
[00:07:28] three
[00:07:31] four will be the bridge five will be the
[00:07:34] door
[00:07:35] yeah then we can do this right in the
[00:07:37] doorway
[00:07:38] stairs open lobby part
[00:07:42] the side stairs and then entering
[00:07:43] through into the room that has
[00:07:45] the next level the bomb battlefield okay
[00:07:48] now let's actually memorize these things
[00:07:50] all right
[00:07:51] okay so the first one i have is
[00:07:54] a friend of mine pam she's climbed with
[00:07:56] me and she's got a bunch of freckles on
[00:07:58] so that one is 9589 so i'm gonna picture
[00:08:02] her
[00:08:02] right here with a bunch of freckles okay
[00:08:05] next one is the sign
[00:08:06] that is a geek so that's 706
[00:08:10] and he's got a scuba tank 695.
[00:08:14] okay so he's by the sign he's got nerdy
[00:08:16] glasses on and he's breathing from a
[00:08:17] scuba apparatus
[00:08:21] then here we have my aunt and
[00:08:24] she's on a rocket ship just flying back
[00:08:27] and forth
[00:08:30] uh then on the bridge we have ah memory
[00:08:33] guy tony buzan
[00:08:34] for those of you who know tony buzan um
[00:08:37] and he's wearing a pope hat
[00:08:38] and i guess i could just picture him
[00:08:40] just kind of waving that poke wave
[00:08:41] to everybody across this bridge next up
[00:08:44] by the door
[00:08:45] we have another memory guy chester
[00:08:48] santos
[00:08:49] um who is sorry chester he's taking a
[00:08:54] a big old dump in front of that door and
[00:08:57] it smells bad
[00:08:58] all right
[00:09:03] okay we'll come in and then maybe on
[00:09:05] this first little star here
[00:09:07] the sun will put my it's another my
[00:09:10] another one on my aunt's and she's
[00:09:11] ringing the bell
[00:09:12] okay so that's what 66544
[00:09:16] then up the stairs here we have my oh
[00:09:19] it's a lot of my family
[00:09:20] uh it's my cousin marie and she's
[00:09:23] climbing a ladder
[00:09:24] which i guess she's got laid down on the
[00:09:26] stairs and she's just climbing it
[00:09:27] then in this open area here will be the
[00:09:29] next one it's a pumpkin playing the
[00:09:31] trumpet
[00:09:32] then we have up here on the steps is
[00:09:34] scrooge
[00:09:37] and he's having a seizure on the stairs
[00:09:39] okay that's not so pleasant
[00:09:41] and then finally a friend of mine bonnie
[00:09:44] she's smoking a cigar okay cool so in my
[00:09:47] head i'm just gonna quickly think about
[00:09:48] it
[00:09:49] i had a pen with freckles my
[00:09:53] geek friend a geek
[00:09:56] uh scuba diving my aunt on a rocket ship
[00:09:59] tiny buzan waving like pope
[00:10:01] chester chancellor was taking um
[00:10:04] my aunt with a bell my cousin
[00:10:08] with the uh ladder pumpkin playing
[00:10:10] trumpet
[00:10:11] screws seizure and bonnie smoking a
[00:10:14] cigar
[00:10:14] cool all right okay we wasted so much
[00:10:17] time let's get a friggin star
[00:10:20] all right so we've memorized the first
[00:10:22] ten
[00:10:25] let's memorize the next ten all right
[00:10:27] let's get the star first here
[00:10:32] there we go nice
[00:10:36] all right so right here i want to put
[00:10:38] the next one right where i am
[00:10:40] that's doc from back to the future and
[00:10:43] he's got a spiky jacket on like a punk
[00:10:45] my other aunt francoise and she's
[00:10:49] saying e.t phone home all right and then
[00:10:51] finally by where the star was
[00:10:53] since this is where i ended up anyways
[00:10:55] by this grading is
[00:10:57] this friend of mine we call him red
[00:10:58] because he's got red hair and he's
[00:11:00] wearing a bro
[00:11:01] a man bro if you remember from seinfeld
[00:11:04] no bro's no good two ethnic the manzier
[00:11:08] cool all right so at this point you can
[00:11:09] probably see that this is gonna take
[00:11:11] some time
[00:11:12] i've got tons and tons of images to go
[00:11:13] through a lot of them are super personal
[00:11:16] they're ones i've curated over the years
[00:11:18] thought up by myself
[00:11:19] and based on people family and
[00:11:22] characters in my life both real and
[00:11:23] fictional that are important to me
[00:11:25] how i came up with that system is kind
[00:11:27] of beyond the scope of this video
[00:11:28] the point of this video is to just show
[00:11:30] you the process of how i would go about
[00:11:32] memorizing something so large
[00:11:34] with a video game memory palace i'm
[00:11:37] basically getting the stars i need to
[00:11:39] in each level and then figuring out
[00:11:40] where i want to place each of the 10
[00:11:42] images
[00:11:42] in the level then place the image or
[00:11:45] imagine it there
[00:11:46] do a quick review and then move on
[00:11:50] so at this point i basically encoded and
[00:11:52] placed about 500 digits
[00:11:55] which was half of what i needed to and i
[00:11:57] had about 20 minutes left to beat the
[00:11:59] game
[00:11:59] and memorize the other 500 digits
[00:12:02] so after this i kind of picked up the
[00:12:04] pace tried to get to the final bowser as
[00:12:06] quick as possible and beat the game so i
[00:12:08] could spend the remaining time
[00:12:09] memorizing what was left
[00:12:10] so what i had to do at this point was
[00:12:12] kind of think of other locations that i
[00:12:14] didn't use on my path to beat the game
[00:12:16] but that i was going to use just to
[00:12:17] store the digits after the fact
[00:12:19] so i thought of different parts of the
[00:12:21] castle other levels that i hadn't
[00:12:23] visited yet
[00:12:24] and kind of quickly went and visited
[00:12:26] them or just kind of mentally visited
[00:12:28] them
[00:12:28] and threw the last remaining digits in
[00:12:30] them
[00:12:32] with dulce de leche okay that's it
[00:12:35] time i'm done
[00:12:39] all right so just under an hour had some
[00:12:43] frustration with the game
[00:12:44] but that's okay i suck but yeah again
[00:12:46] the interesting part here was the memory
[00:12:48] not the gameplay
[00:12:49] without further ado let me actually
[00:12:54] from memory try to do all 1000 digits
[00:12:58] this may be tough to watch i may speed
[00:13:00] it up or i may
[00:13:02] cut it a bit and then link to somewhere
[00:13:06] up here
[00:13:06] uh the full version if you want to watch
[00:13:08] me say all 1000
[00:13:10] without mistakes but let's see
[00:13:13] all right so we have um
[00:13:16] let me look at the time right now okay
[00:13:20] so we have what do we have oh yeah
[00:13:24] nine five eight eight nine seven zero
[00:13:27] six nine five
[00:13:28] three six five uh three four nine
[00:13:33] four zero six zero three four zero two
[00:13:35] one six six
[00:13:36] five four four um
[00:13:39] three seven five five eight nine zero
[00:13:41] zero four five six three two
[00:13:44] eight eight two two five zero five okay
[00:13:47] one down
[00:13:49] four five two five five six four zero
[00:13:51] five six
[00:13:52] uh four four eight two four
[00:14:04] i have to look i don't know this one
[00:14:10] zero five six zero zero uh
[00:14:13] one zero one six five five
[00:14:16] two five six three and then seven
[00:14:19] five six seven eight
[00:14:23] all right guys that is it i am done
[00:14:27] with this video i am exhausted i would
[00:14:30] have done that at a
[00:14:31] more leisurely pace but now i have those
[00:14:34] thousand digits in this memory pals i
[00:14:36] can always go back and review them
[00:14:38] that's the nice thing is like i don't
[00:14:39] worry too much about
[00:14:41] getting it perfect like i made some
[00:14:43] mistakes it's not a big deal because i
[00:14:45] know that with one more pass if i just
[00:14:46] review this one or two more times
[00:14:48] it will be there you saw how good it was
[00:14:50] already just a little more review
[00:14:52] that'd be perfect um and yeah you saw
[00:14:55] how i was able to just take
[00:14:57] a memory palace on the go as i was
[00:14:59] actually doing another
[00:15:00] task which was trying to beat the game
[00:15:02] and uh it wasn't too big a deal
[00:15:04] and there was actually a lot of room to
[00:15:07] spare i only used small portions of each
[00:15:09] section there could have been a lot more
[00:15:11] use and i could probably store more
[00:15:13] numbers in there as well
[00:15:14] yeah i hope that was interesting i hope
[00:15:16] that helped you out maybe think of ideas
[00:15:18] for your own memory palaces maybe you
[00:15:19] want to go in and play this game and
[00:15:21] come up with your own memory palaces if
[00:15:23] you have any suggestions of any other
[00:15:25] video games you'd like me to
[00:15:27] create memory palaces out of please let
[00:15:28] me know in the description i'd love to
[00:15:30] play them
[00:15:31] there's a lot of really kind of good
[00:15:33] content out there maybe
[00:15:34] minecraft or something fortnite what do
[00:15:38] you think
[00:15:38] let me know among us among us i just
[00:15:42] forget about
[00:15:42] whether i'm an imposter or crew member
[00:15:44] and just go around the map memorizing
[00:15:46] stuff how long would that be everybody
[00:15:47] would think i'd be suspicious as hell
[00:15:50] anyways i'll see you guys in the next
[00:15:51] video thanks for watching please like
[00:15:53] and subscribe
[00:15:54] and uh hope you're having a great end of

=== the one strategy that helps me finish books. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KngNT00VVY

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:15] i've made a couple of videos sharing
[00:00:17] some tips on how to consume
[00:00:18] more books how to do it quicker and how
[00:00:21] to do it more efficiently
[00:00:22] without sacrificing retention but what
[00:00:25] good are tips if you're actually not
[00:00:26] sitting down reading and finishing
[00:00:28] the actual books this video is about the
[00:00:31] one strategy that helps me finish
[00:00:33] books i don't know about you but my
[00:00:35] schedule is absolutely nuts
[00:00:37] i have very little time to do anything
[00:00:40] else
[00:00:41] or do i last year i managed to read over
[00:00:44] 52 books
[00:00:45] and this year i'm on track to beat that
[00:00:47] how
[00:00:48] the heck i personally blame my mild ocd
[00:00:51] but here's how i've been doing it and
[00:00:52] what i think might help a lot of you
[00:00:54] guys
[00:00:54] get through more books and actually
[00:00:56] finish the ones you're trying to get
[00:00:57] through
[00:00:58] before i do i'm sure there's a lot of
[00:01:00] you that might be wondering one thing
[00:01:01] why rush through books why not take your
[00:01:04] time
[00:01:04] in the wise words of my pal ali abdul
[00:01:07] well
[00:01:07] i'll let him save himself i kind of
[00:01:09] think of it like riding a bike
[00:01:11] so it's like sometimes when you're
[00:01:12] riding a bike you want to really enjoy
[00:01:14] the journey and you want to smell the
[00:01:15] roses along the way so you want to go at
[00:01:16] like three miles per hour
[00:01:18] so you can breathe it all in but
[00:01:19] sometimes when you're riding a bike your
[00:01:21] objective is to get from a to b
[00:01:23] and let's say you're running late for
[00:01:24] work for your lectures you actually
[00:01:26] don't really care about smelling the
[00:01:27] roses on the way there you just want to
[00:01:29] get there as quickly as possible
[00:01:30] yeah what he said anyways here's the
[00:01:33] strategy i use
[00:01:35] to finish books before the start of each
[00:01:38] month i'll pre-select four books that i
[00:01:40] want to read
[00:01:41] one for each week then i'll go through
[00:01:42] each of the books and see how many pages
[00:01:44] it has
[00:01:45] divide it by seven then put these little
[00:01:47] labels on those pages
[00:01:49] that way i know exactly how far i need
[00:01:51] to read each day
[00:01:52] to finish the book in a week four books
[00:01:55] is just what works for me
[00:01:56] it's a realistic number that i don't
[00:01:57] find too overwhelming and just enough of
[00:02:00] a lightweight challenge
[00:02:01] you can adjust this as you see fit also
[00:02:03] you don't have to start on every first
[00:02:04] of the month for this
[00:02:05] i like to do that because yeah my mild
[00:02:08] ocd
[00:02:09] all right so let's take for example this
[00:02:11] book which is
[00:02:12] harry potter and the sorcerer's stone
[00:02:16] oh the philosopher's stone and yes
[00:02:18] embarrassingly so i have yet to read
[00:02:20] this
[00:02:21] i've been saving it for christmas and
[00:02:23] this year
[00:02:24] is the christmas i'm gonna read it
[00:02:27] [Music]
[00:02:28] so what i first do is i look at the
[00:02:31] first page of
[00:02:32] actual reading which happens on
[00:02:35] page one and then i look at the page
[00:02:37] that the actual reading
[00:02:39] ends which is there's a whole bunch of
[00:02:42] stuff in the back here but it's page
[00:02:45] 331 so 331 divided by 7 gives you
[00:02:48] roughly about
[00:02:49] 47 pages per i don't need to be so
[00:02:52] specific so i'll just probably round up
[00:02:54] to 50
[00:02:55] reading 50 pages of this book for the
[00:02:58] next seven days to complete it
[00:03:00] by the end of the week then all i do is
[00:03:03] i put
[00:03:04] i choose a color i'm gonna do green for
[00:03:05] this book and just put little markers
[00:03:08] you can do this with anything it doesn't
[00:03:09] have to be posted
[00:03:10] on each of those increments of 50
[00:03:12] starting
[00:03:13] with obviously page one
[00:03:17] then i'll go to page 50 put one there
[00:03:21] and so on and so on now this is a bit of
[00:03:23] a tedious process
[00:03:25] but i really find that having these
[00:03:27] markers just
[00:03:28] convinces me oh that's all i have to
[00:03:30] read today i can do that and i just make
[00:03:32] sure that i get to the next marker by
[00:03:34] the end of the day
[00:03:35] and it's not too strict if i maybe don't
[00:03:37] get through it or i don't get to it one
[00:03:40] day
[00:03:40] then i have a little bit more i need to
[00:03:41] read the next day or if i feel like
[00:03:43] reading more
[00:03:44] i can read more and then the next day
[00:03:45] i'll have to read as much
[00:03:48] you can also apply this same strategy to
[00:03:50] other book reading platforms for example
[00:03:52] my personal goal this year has been to
[00:03:54] finish seven books a month
[00:03:56] so i split that up into three buckets
[00:03:59] physical books that i read like with my
[00:04:00] hands
[00:04:01] audio books that i read with my ears and
[00:04:04] digital books
[00:04:05] like with an e-reader or on my phone for
[00:04:07] audiobooks i aim for two a month
[00:04:09] this can vary because some self-help
[00:04:11] books are super short like three to five
[00:04:13] hours while more in-depth books
[00:04:15] are usually 10 plus hours i'm a fan of
[00:04:17] reading physical books when i can
[00:04:19] so i usually choose audiobooks that are
[00:04:20] simple non-fiction self-help
[00:04:23] kind of thing that i can listen to on
[00:04:24] autopilot anyways that's one book every
[00:04:26] two weeks
[00:04:27] so i'll find the total time of the book
[00:04:29] divided by 15
[00:04:30] and make a note somewhere that i need to
[00:04:32] listen to that many minutes slash hours
[00:04:34] per day i'll usually listen to these
[00:04:36] books when i'm working out driving or
[00:04:38] walking somewhere
[00:04:39] on top of that i'll play around with a
[00:04:40] listening speed usually i can tolerate
[00:04:42] two times speed but sometimes during
[00:04:44] boring parts i'll speed it up to as much
[00:04:46] as
[00:04:46] three times and interesting parts i slow
[00:04:49] it down to about 1.5 times
[00:04:51] for digital books like ebooks or on my
[00:04:53] phone i'll aim for one book a month
[00:04:56] divide the length into four and that's
[00:04:57] how many pages i need to read each week
[00:04:59] the rules on this one aren't so strictly
[00:05:01] defined because it's the one book i
[00:05:02] probably care the least about
[00:05:04] and will scroll through my phone tablet
[00:05:06] or e-reader when i have a quick second
[00:05:08] and don't have access to my other two
[00:05:10] reading buckets here's a little pro tip
[00:05:12] by the way
[00:05:12] if i find myself lagging on this book
[00:05:15] and not making progress
[00:05:16] i might actually buy the audio book on
[00:05:18] audible and use it to speed up my
[00:05:20] listening process
[00:05:21] then when i'm near the end i'll actually
[00:05:23] return the audiobook which audible
[00:05:25] allows you to do
[00:05:26] and finish it on my e-reader great
[00:05:28] success
[00:05:29] anyways there you have it nothing super
[00:05:32] groundbreaking there
[00:05:33] it's just a small little strategy that i
[00:05:35] use to get
[00:05:36] stuff done there's tons of books i want
[00:05:38] to read i don't just want to get through
[00:05:40] one or two books a year
[00:05:41] i want to read as many books as i can so
[00:05:44] that's what i'm doing
[00:05:45] and maybe you guys can try it and see
[00:05:46] how it works for you that's it for this
[00:05:48] video thanks for watching
[00:05:49] i'm out

=== LEARN ALL 46 US PRESIDENTS! (School of Memory Ep. 2) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTmh71_jocs

[00:00:05] [Music]
[00:00:09] hello there
[00:00:10] hi my name is nelson dallas i'm a
[00:00:12] four-time usm memory champ
[00:00:13] and uh in this video we're going to talk
[00:00:15] about how to memorize
[00:00:17] all 46 u.s presidents
[00:00:20] in order that's right in order from
[00:00:23] start to finish
[00:00:24] to the oldest to the newest and we're
[00:00:26] going to accomplish this by using a
[00:00:28] technique called the story method
[00:00:30] which basically takes all the president
[00:00:32] names that we have
[00:00:33] turns them into funny weird pictures and
[00:00:35] then weaves them into
[00:00:36] an interesting memorable story turns out
[00:00:39] we remember that kind of stuff
[00:00:41] a lot better than the dry boring names
[00:00:44] that those presidents had
[00:00:45] or have i'm trying to make this as quick
[00:00:47] and painless as possible
[00:00:49] i want you guys to have all of these
[00:00:50] presidents in your noggin as fast as
[00:00:52] possible
[00:00:53] so let's get started now before we dive
[00:00:56] into this
[00:00:57] all i need you to do this first time
[00:00:59] through is just listen and
[00:01:00] see the story that i'm about to describe
[00:01:02] to you just a story you're just
[00:01:04] listening you're enjoying you're
[00:01:05] thinking about it
[00:01:07] but you're secretly memorizing it so
[00:01:09] don't do anything just listen and watch
[00:01:11] and afterwards we'll go through what
[00:01:13] meant what which images represented
[00:01:15] which presidents
[00:01:16] and you'll be amazed with yourself all
[00:01:18] right so we start with a washing machine
[00:01:20] there's a washing machine that's going
[00:01:22] to be filled with a
[00:01:23] ton of bright green granny smith
[00:01:26] apples next up a chef comes over
[00:01:30] opens up the door and as he's doing that
[00:01:33] his chef attire
[00:01:34] turns into made attire so he turns from
[00:01:37] a chef
[00:01:38] into a maid kind of weird but hey that's
[00:01:41] his wardrobe change and that's what he
[00:01:43] wants to do
[00:01:44] he opens up the door tons of apples and
[00:01:47] tons of water come
[00:01:48] flying out and he gets carried away down
[00:01:52] kind of the street but it's a river of
[00:01:54] water and
[00:01:55] a man rowing picks him up and saves him
[00:01:58] from drowning now this boat is sailing
[00:02:00] down the street and they notice that if
[00:02:01] they squint off into the distance they
[00:02:03] actually can see
[00:02:04] a dam there's a dam ahead a big one that
[00:02:07] they squint
[00:02:08] at and as they squint and see this damn
[00:02:09] they see on top of it that a jackhammer
[00:02:12] is being jackhammered is the jackhammer
[00:02:15] jackhammered
[00:02:16] into the top of that dam sort of
[00:02:19] starting to make a crack appear down the
[00:02:21] face of the dam now as the chef
[00:02:23] and the guy rowing the boat kind of get
[00:02:25] closer to the dam
[00:02:27] a van that's on fire a van that's
[00:02:29] burning
[00:02:30] flies out of nowhere and just crash
[00:02:32] splashes her splashes
[00:02:34] into the river slash lake whatever
[00:02:37] they're in
[00:02:37] right next to them who's the driver as
[00:02:40] weird as it can get
[00:02:41] a hairy sun it's a sun with some facial
[00:02:44] hair he's a hairy son
[00:02:45] he says get in get in the van obviously
[00:02:47] the boat wasn't enough they got to get
[00:02:49] in this van
[00:02:50] and kind of uh seek shelter there
[00:02:52] because that that dam is gonna blow
[00:02:53] upon further inspection you notice that
[00:02:55] this hairy son
[00:02:57] is wearing a cool necktie usually you
[00:02:59] wouldn't notice that but it's the
[00:03:01] coolest necktie you've ever seen so
[00:03:02] you notice it he's wearing a necktie now
[00:03:04] as you get in the van with this hairy
[00:03:06] sun with the necktie
[00:03:07] you look back at the dam and you notice
[00:03:09] that that crack is getting bigger and
[00:03:10] bigger
[00:03:11] and poking out of part of the hole that
[00:03:14] you see
[00:03:14] developing is a tail like a dog's tail
[00:03:17] kind of poking out
[00:03:18] and it's a tail just wagging there kind
[00:03:21] of
[00:03:21] freaks you out you realize there's a dog
[00:03:23] trapped inside of there
[00:03:24] and you dive off try to climb up the dam
[00:03:27] to pull it out to save it
[00:03:28] to rescue it before the whole thing
[00:03:30] comes apart now as you're doing this you
[00:03:32] notice that there's someone
[00:03:33] filming on the riverbanks at this whole
[00:03:36] heroic deed that you're doing
[00:03:38] so there's a filmer let's call him a
[00:03:40] filmer because he's filming that's what
[00:03:42] filmer does right he films now as this
[00:03:44] is all unfolding you rescue the
[00:03:46] dog get back to the van safely and as
[00:03:48] predicted the dam
[00:03:50] explodes and a piece actually pierces
[00:03:54] a cannon that is off to the side the
[00:03:56] cannon lights
[00:03:57] and boom shoots out a bunch of books
[00:04:00] it's a book canon if we follow where
[00:04:02] that book lands
[00:04:03] it lands next to this guy who's sitting
[00:04:06] on a john
[00:04:06] and it is one of our most well-known
[00:04:09] presidents
[00:04:10] it is president lincoln he doesn't need
[00:04:12] his own picture because he's as
[00:04:14] easy to memorize as
[00:04:17] as as pi
[00:04:20] so the book lands next to president
[00:04:22] lincoln who's sitting on the john
[00:04:24] as he's sitting on the john a genie
[00:04:27] kind of appears out of nowhere this this
[00:04:29] story is making no sense so the genie
[00:04:31] comes out and says i will grant
[00:04:33] you some wishes so he wishes for three
[00:04:36] things usually
[00:04:37] you get granted three wishes the first
[00:04:38] is a haystack second wish was for
[00:04:41] garfield the cat
[00:04:42] dressed like king arthur and lastly was
[00:04:45] lebron james he's a huge lebron james
[00:04:48] fan he wants to meet him
[00:04:49] in the flesh so boom that's the third
[00:04:52] wish
[00:04:52] now just at that moment the hairy son
[00:04:54] that was driving the van suddenly shows
[00:04:56] up out of nowhere i guess he ditched the
[00:04:58] van
[00:04:58] and came ashore and he's a huge lebron
[00:05:01] james fan
[00:05:02] as well so he jumps at him and gives him
[00:05:04] a massive hug
[00:05:05] suddenly out of nowhere mickey mouse
[00:05:07] dressed as a king
[00:05:08] wearing a rose-covered belt comes out of
[00:05:12] nowhere
[00:05:13] and joins the party now this collection
[00:05:16] of weird characters
[00:05:17] need to get a move on the dam has just
[00:05:20] exploded water is rising
[00:05:22] so they build a raft to kind of float
[00:05:25] away
[00:05:25] and they notice that on this raft
[00:05:27] there's actually a bucket filled with
[00:05:29] wilson tennis balls i don't know
[00:05:32] as they start heading down the river on
[00:05:34] this raft there's kind of this cool
[00:05:36] montage soundtrack of hard rock being
[00:05:39] played
[00:05:39] as they kind of jet set down the river
[00:05:41] safely on their wrath as they go down
[00:05:43] this waterway
[00:05:44] this raft is decked out it's got music
[00:05:47] blasting
[00:05:48] there's actually a fan blowing cool air
[00:05:51] to everybody on the raft and there's
[00:05:53] even a vacuum or a hoover as the british
[00:05:55] like to say
[00:05:56] so if people want to clean up after
[00:05:58] their mess they can do so
[00:06:00] as they approach the shore they get
[00:06:01] stuck in some kind of overgrown
[00:06:03] set of rose branches with thorns and
[00:06:06] next to it is just a man
[00:06:07] there who's telling the truth he's a
[00:06:10] truth man all he does is tell the truth
[00:06:12] and even weirder still about this guy
[00:06:14] he takes out his eyeballs and he puts
[00:06:17] them in a
[00:06:18] shower nearby he's got to wash his eyes
[00:06:20] he sees the truth so i guess his eyes
[00:06:22] have to be super clean
[00:06:23] so he's got eyes in the shower as those
[00:06:26] eyeballs are taking a shower
[00:06:28] they suddenly see a space rocket launch
[00:06:30] into space
[00:06:31] and then land in a pile of pb and j
[00:06:34] sandwiches
[00:06:35] with lemons all around it it's called a
[00:06:37] great mess so the only way to clean it
[00:06:39] up is with a big
[00:06:40] pair of knickers so the whole crew
[00:06:43] grabbed a bunch of knickers i don't know
[00:06:45] where they got them from knickers are
[00:06:46] underwear okay and they use it to kind
[00:06:49] of pat dry all that peanut butter and
[00:06:52] lemon juice and whatever to clean it up
[00:06:53] on the riverbank they find a
[00:06:55] ford car kind of decked out with a ray
[00:06:58] gun
[00:06:58] on the top and they all get in the car
[00:07:00] and start driving down the riverbank
[00:07:02] they're driving crazy they run into a
[00:07:04] bush then they run into a massive piece
[00:07:06] of lint
[00:07:07] then they run into another bush as one
[00:07:09] does as they're speeding down through
[00:07:11] all that stuff they finally see the last
[00:07:13] obstacle which is a
[00:07:14] bomb it's got the fuse it's counting
[00:07:16] down it's gonna
[00:07:17] explode it's a bomb so they swerve out
[00:07:20] of the way
[00:07:21] dive out of the car and as they do that
[00:07:23] there are
[00:07:24] trumpets just blaring as if to celebrate
[00:07:27] that they just avoided death and that
[00:07:29] now they are
[00:07:30] safe and then lastly they all start
[00:07:32] biting each other
[00:07:35] i know that's weird that whole story is
[00:07:37] super weird and super
[00:07:39] ridiculous but i guarantee you if you go
[00:07:41] back through that
[00:07:42] maybe one or two more times you will
[00:07:44] have that story and those key
[00:07:45] components to it in your head and if you
[00:07:48] have that in your head
[00:07:50] then you have all the presidents how let
[00:07:52] me show you
[00:07:53] the washing machine with a ton of things
[00:07:55] in it was washington
[00:07:57] the granny smith apples was adam's
[00:08:00] because
[00:08:00] adam's apples the chef was jefferson
[00:08:03] jefferson
[00:08:04] the maid costume was madison
[00:08:07] madison so some of these are a bit of a
[00:08:09] stretch but that doesn't matter it's
[00:08:10] just a small
[00:08:11] cue to help you get the name of the
[00:08:13] president they don't have to be perfect
[00:08:14] you get from the boat right with the man
[00:08:16] rowing
[00:08:16] that's manrow monroe then they squint at
[00:08:20] a dam that's to help you remember
[00:08:21] quincy adams the jackhammer that's
[00:08:24] jackson
[00:08:25] then the van burning van burning is van
[00:08:27] buren then the driver is a hairy son
[00:08:30] that's harrison who's wearing a necktie
[00:08:32] or a tie that's tyler
[00:08:34] inside the damn there's something poking
[00:08:36] out that's poke
[00:08:37] it's a tail that's taylor there's a
[00:08:40] filmer filming the whole thing
[00:08:41] filmer is filled more the whole damn
[00:08:43] explodes and
[00:08:44] pierces a cannon that shoots books so
[00:08:47] you have pierce
[00:08:48] and that book cannon buchanan lincoln
[00:08:51] lincoln is lincoln and he's sitting on
[00:08:52] the john that's johnson
[00:08:54] the genie grants him some wishes grant
[00:08:57] is the next one
[00:08:58] and he wishes for a haystack that's
[00:09:00] hayes garfield
[00:09:01] that's garfield dressed like king arthur
[00:09:03] so that's just arthur
[00:09:05] then you have lebron who is basically
[00:09:07] cleveland
[00:09:08] the harry son comes back that's another
[00:09:10] harrison and he hugs lebron so another
[00:09:12] cleveland
[00:09:13] next mickey mouse comes out dressed as a
[00:09:15] king mckinley
[00:09:17] mckinley he's also wearing a
[00:09:18] rose-covered belt that's
[00:09:20] roosevelt roosevelt they all get on a
[00:09:23] raft
[00:09:24] raft taft on the raft there's a bucket
[00:09:26] filled with wilson tennis balls it's
[00:09:28] wilson
[00:09:29] that hard rock music is playing that's
[00:09:32] harding
[00:09:32] there's a fan blowing cool air that's
[00:09:35] coolidge
[00:09:36] and a vacuum or hoover president hoover
[00:09:38] they get to the shore and there's an
[00:09:40] overgrown
[00:09:41] rose thorn bush thing so that's another
[00:09:44] rose
[00:09:44] roosevelt and who's standing there it's
[00:09:46] a truth man
[00:09:48] or true man he takes his eyes out and
[00:09:49] gives him a shower that's eyes in
[00:09:51] shower eisenhower that was so ridiculous
[00:09:54] he sees with his eyes a space rocket
[00:09:56] face rocket should remind you of jfk
[00:09:59] since he took us to the moon and it
[00:10:00] lands in a bunch of pb js with lemons so
[00:10:03] it's really pvj with an l
[00:10:05] so lbj lyndon b johnson everybody starts
[00:10:08] cleaning stuff up with some oversized
[00:10:10] knickers
[00:10:10] knickers is to help you remember nixon
[00:10:13] then they get in a
[00:10:14] ford car so that's ford and carter and
[00:10:17] on top of it is a ray gun
[00:10:19] reagan they start driving they hit a
[00:10:21] bush that's bush they run through a
[00:10:23] massive piece of lint
[00:10:24] clinton then they go through another
[00:10:26] bush that's bush jr w
[00:10:29] and then they approach a bomb that's
[00:10:31] obama
[00:10:32] and then the trumpets play that's trump
[00:10:34] and then finally
[00:10:36] everybody's biting everyone that's
[00:10:38] fighting
[00:10:39] [Music]
[00:10:41] was that was that hard was that how much
[00:10:43] time was that i know i talked a mile a
[00:10:44] minute i know that was really
[00:10:46] weird but that is how our brains like to
[00:10:48] memorize things it's a lot easier it's a
[00:10:50] lot more friendly
[00:10:51] and you'd be surprised what you remember
[00:10:53] if you just go through that story and
[00:10:54] now you have all 46 presidents
[00:10:56] in your locket yes all right guys that's
[00:10:58] it for this video i hope you enjoyed it

[00:00:20] out in the dirt
[00:00:41] [Music]
[00:00:52] what's up guys really excited to make
[00:00:54] this video it's been a long time coming
[00:00:56] if you remember about two years ago
[00:00:58] i made a video on how to solve a two by
[00:01:01] two rubik's cube
[00:01:02] blindfolded now we're gonna up the ante
[00:01:05] and do it with a
[00:01:06] three by three blindfold just a side
[00:01:10] note
[00:01:10] you do not need any previous experience
[00:01:13] solving one of these
[00:01:14] in fact i'm going to assume that you
[00:01:16] have never solved one of these in your
[00:01:17] life
[00:01:18] and i'm going to teach you how to do it
[00:01:20] without looking
[00:01:22] yeah it's not as hard as you think the
[00:01:24] memory part of it is actually
[00:01:26] not too hard with my help and expertise
[00:01:28] i can make it
[00:01:29] a lot easier and it's one of those
[00:01:32] things that if you can do it it's
[00:01:35] impressive
[00:01:35] as hell i mean people get impressed when
[00:01:37] you can just solve a rubik's cube
[00:01:39] looking at it and take a few minutes
[00:01:40] imagine if you could do
[00:01:42] the memorization of the rubik's cube and
[00:01:44] solve it in just a few minutes
[00:01:47] anyways let's start with the basics
[00:01:49] let's go
[00:01:52] first of all the first thing you got to
[00:01:54] notice about a
[00:01:55] rubik's cube and if your experience with
[00:01:59] a rubik's cube please fast forward
[00:02:00] is that there are three kinds of pieces
[00:02:02] there are the center pieces which are
[00:02:04] the ones in the middle
[00:02:05] and they are essentially just one
[00:02:07] sticker they don't move they stay
[00:02:09] right there in the middle on the face
[00:02:11] that they are then you have edges which
[00:02:12] are basically combinations of two
[00:02:14] stickers
[00:02:15] then finally you have the corner pieces
[00:02:16] which are a combination of three
[00:02:18] stickers so this technique is all about
[00:02:20] how to memorize the sequence in which we
[00:02:22] place the edges correctly
[00:02:23] and then the corners correctly that's it
[00:02:25] we don't have to memorize centers
[00:02:26] because they don't move
[00:02:27] there's nothing to memorize in terms of
[00:02:29] how you can turn the cube there's a
[00:02:31] special notation that we use to write
[00:02:33] out a series of moves this is called an
[00:02:35] algorithm
[00:02:37] for this tutorial i recommend having the
[00:02:39] white face
[00:02:40] up and the green face towards you you
[00:02:43] don't have to go that way but it'll
[00:02:44] mirror what i'm doing this whole video
[00:02:46] so why not do that and that's what i do
[00:02:48] anyways
[00:02:49] so for notation we have six faces so we
[00:02:51] have six different letters
[00:02:53] for our algorithm notation this is gonna
[00:02:55] be u for up
[00:02:56] this is gonna be d for down f for front
[00:02:58] because it's facing you
[00:03:00] this is gonna be b for back because it's
[00:03:02] facing the back
[00:03:03] r for right your right and this is going
[00:03:05] to be l
[00:03:06] for your left when i say u it means turn
[00:03:09] the face that i'm talking about which
[00:03:11] would be this one
[00:03:12] clockwise if i say u prime with a little
[00:03:15] dash next to it means go
[00:03:16] counterclockwise which means that way if
[00:03:18] at any point in my algorithm or an
[00:03:20] algorithm that i show you
[00:03:21] you see a letter squared that basically
[00:03:24] means turn it twice
[00:03:25] and in that case it doesn't matter if
[00:03:27] you do it clockwise or counterclockwise
[00:03:28] because you end up in the same spot
[00:03:32] now solving a rubik's cube blindfolded
[00:03:35] at least with the method that i'm going
[00:03:36] to show you which is called old pacman
[00:03:38] method
[00:03:39] the way it works is you have to memorize
[00:03:41] a sequence of
[00:03:43] pieces okay so there's a little bit of
[00:03:44] memory there and you're gonna use two
[00:03:46] and sometimes one extra one
[00:03:48] for parity algorithms to solve the whole
[00:03:52] thing
[00:03:53] usually when you learn how to solve a
[00:03:54] rubik's cube just generally you need to
[00:03:56] memorize a bunch of algorithms for this
[00:03:58] one you just need to memorize
[00:03:59] three and you're gonna use two of them
[00:04:02] ninety percent of the time
[00:04:03] all right so the algorithms you need to
[00:04:04] know one is called the t
[00:04:06] perm okay which basically is a stands
[00:04:09] for t permutation
[00:04:10] it actually swaps two corners and
[00:04:13] two edges at the same time and we're
[00:04:15] going to do a series of t-perms
[00:04:17] for solving all the edges and then we're
[00:04:20] going to use another algorithm which is
[00:04:21] a variation of
[00:04:22] y perm to solve all the corners
[00:04:26] okay and the process goes like this
[00:04:28] you're gonna have a scrambled cube
[00:04:30] you pick it up and you're gonna look at
[00:04:32] the corners you're gonna memorize a
[00:04:33] sequence that will help you
[00:04:35] solve the corners then you're gonna look
[00:04:38] at the edges
[00:04:38] and figure out a sequence that will help
[00:04:41] you remember how to solve the edges
[00:04:42] you're gonna put the blindfold on and
[00:04:44] then you're gonna solve the edges and
[00:04:45] then you're gonna solve the corners
[00:04:47] so it goes memo of corners memo of edges
[00:04:50] solve edges solve corners
[00:04:55] so the t-perm goes like this
[00:05:02] and notice that it swapped these two
[00:05:03] corners and swapped those two edges
[00:05:06] let's do that one more time
[00:05:13] that and then the y perm is
[00:05:23] and notice that it swapped these two
[00:05:25] pieces here
[00:05:27] and these two pieces here kind of makes
[00:05:29] a weird y
[00:05:36] shape
[00:05:38] we'll cover that third algorithm in a
[00:05:39] little bit because it only applies to
[00:05:41] certain cases
[00:05:42] the majority of the times you're just
[00:05:44] going to use those two algorithms to
[00:05:45] solve
[00:05:46] everything let's talk a little bit about
[00:05:49] how to
[00:05:50] memorize the cube like how does this
[00:05:52] work it seems like there's so many
[00:05:53] combinations how can you possibly
[00:05:55] memorize
[00:05:56] anything in advance but it's actually
[00:05:58] pretty simple and it's pretty clever too
[00:06:00] so let's start with the edges okay so we
[00:06:03] have this t-perm
[00:06:04] right and i said that in terms of edges
[00:06:06] at least the t-perm
[00:06:07] swaps two edges always the same ones
[00:06:10] so the goal is to memorize a sequence
[00:06:15] and if i can bring the edge that i'm
[00:06:18] trying to
[00:06:19] place a piece into to this swap zone
[00:06:22] then apply the algorithm it'll swap it
[00:06:24] to what we call this buffer zone and
[00:06:26] kind of keep it there
[00:06:27] and then if i place the actual edge that
[00:06:30] i want
[00:06:31] to hold that piece and then swap it
[00:06:33] again it's going to go to that spot
[00:06:36] right as long as i put it back same kind
[00:06:38] of idea applies for the corners
[00:06:40] except we use a different buffer zone
[00:06:42] and a different swap zone
[00:06:43] for the corners this top one right here
[00:06:47] is going to be the buffer zone and then
[00:06:49] this p sticker down here is going to be
[00:06:51] the swap zone if you're still confused
[00:06:53] don't worry i like to learn by doing
[00:06:55] examples and we'll do some of those in
[00:06:57] just a moment
[00:06:58] to do that though we do need what's
[00:07:00] called a lettering scheme
[00:07:01] some means to identify all the stickers
[00:07:03] on the cube so the way we do that is
[00:07:05] with
[00:07:06] an alphabetic lettering system let's do
[00:07:08] corners first starting on the
[00:07:10] top face it's a b c d you're going
[00:07:13] clockwise
[00:07:14] then we go to the left face e f g
[00:07:18] h i j k l
[00:07:22] m n o p on the back
[00:07:26] q r s t and then on the bottom
[00:07:30] u v w x and then for the edges it's the
[00:07:33] same lettering scheme just
[00:07:34] the edge pieces so a b c
[00:07:37] d e f g
[00:07:40] h i j k l m n
[00:07:44] o p q r s t and then
[00:07:47] u v w x so now we can refer to any
[00:07:50] corner
[00:07:51] any edge and know exactly which one
[00:07:54] we're talking about based on these
[00:07:55] lettering schemes
[00:07:56] all right let's start with a very simple
[00:07:58] few cases
[00:07:59] so you're gonna have a bunch of jumbled
[00:08:01] edges and when you look at the cube
[00:08:03] you're gonna look at the buffer zone
[00:08:05] this is
[00:08:06] this piece right here we call that upper
[00:08:08] right
[00:08:09] up right okay and the swap zone
[00:08:13] is upper left but i'm gonna look at the
[00:08:16] piece that is
[00:08:16] in the upper right when i
[00:08:20] i'm looking at the scramble cube and say
[00:08:22] where what is the letter
[00:08:23] of where that sticker is supposed to go
[00:08:25] okay so if it's supposed to go to
[00:08:27] l then i memorize l
[00:08:31] and then i look at l and there's gonna
[00:08:33] be a piece there
[00:08:34] that should be there and that's gotta go
[00:08:36] somewhere else right so i gotta memorize
[00:08:38] where that piece goes
[00:08:40] the letter let's say it goes to n
[00:08:44] so now i have ln
[00:08:47] and you carry on with that procedure
[00:08:49] stringing together a bunch of letters
[00:08:51] that will help you memorize the sequence
[00:08:53] of swaps so let's just say
[00:08:55] that that was my first thing l and so
[00:08:58] this is what that would look like so i'm
[00:08:59] looking at the buffer
[00:09:00] this is mostly solved but if i were to
[00:09:02] look at this and say okay
[00:09:03] this buffer zone needs to go to l and
[00:09:05] then this piece needs to go to
[00:09:08] n okay so i memorize ln now what do i do
[00:09:11] okay
[00:09:12] well when i start memorizing i gotta
[00:09:15] my first letter is l so i gotta put l
[00:09:18] the l
[00:09:19] piece in the swap zone because that's
[00:09:22] the only
[00:09:22] my algorithm only swaps those two it
[00:09:24] doesn't swap to l it swaps to
[00:09:26] this upper left piece so i got to put
[00:09:29] the l there
[00:09:30] swap it and then make sure i replace it
[00:09:32] back the only thing you got to be aware
[00:09:33] of when you're setting up these moves
[00:09:35] is that you don't disturb the buffer
[00:09:38] zone
[00:09:38] okay so you can't move anything that
[00:09:41] will disturb these top three stickers
[00:09:43] to put l up there that's actually not
[00:09:45] too bad i just gotta turn it up one
[00:09:47] and yes you messed up other stuff but as
[00:09:49] long as you do the algorithm and return
[00:09:51] it back the same way
[00:09:52] nothing else will be disturbed so i put
[00:09:55] l up top
[00:09:56] and now i do my t perm
[00:10:02] and put it back and now you'll notice
[00:10:05] that l
[00:10:05] is back where it should be then our next
[00:10:08] letter was
[00:10:08] n right so n is the sticker over here
[00:10:12] i got to bring it to this swap zone
[00:10:15] now at first it's going to be a bit
[00:10:17] tricky to understand how to do that
[00:10:18] without
[00:10:19] bugging this but if i do one kind of
[00:10:22] y d turn counterclockwise clockwise l
[00:10:26] and then do it
[00:10:31] and then undo it so i do a l prime and
[00:10:33] then
[00:10:34] a y d prime and then the cube is solved
[00:10:39] a couple things about memorization so we
[00:10:41] did a couple examples there that were
[00:10:44] basically just two letters a lot of the
[00:10:46] sequences that you'll have to memorize
[00:10:48] let's say for the edges and the corners
[00:10:50] will be maybe six to 12 letters long
[00:10:53] now what i do and what a lot of
[00:10:55] speedcubers do
[00:10:57] is they will pair letters together and
[00:10:59] make little words
[00:11:01] you know from my channel i'm all about
[00:11:02] that so in the previous example we had
[00:11:05] l and n so i might have thought of let's
[00:11:08] say lando calrissian
[00:11:10] right because it started with an ln
[00:11:12] sound at the beginning lando
[00:11:15] so what i'll do again i'll pick up the
[00:11:17] cube that's scrambled
[00:11:18] and i'll look at the corners first i
[00:11:20] start by looking at the buffer zone of
[00:11:22] the corners
[00:11:23] and say where does that go what is the
[00:11:26] letter piece
[00:11:27] where that should be and then when i get
[00:11:30] to that piece i say where does that
[00:11:31] letter go
[00:11:32] and so on and so on and as i'm doing
[00:11:34] that i'm
[00:11:35] creating these pairs of letters and
[00:11:37] making little words
[00:11:38] and picturing them and connecting them
[00:11:40] into some kind of linked
[00:11:42] list so if the first one was lando
[00:11:44] calrissian and the next one was like
[00:11:47] i don't know g m maybe i thought of gum
[00:11:50] so i think of lando calrissian chewing
[00:11:52] some gum
[00:11:52] and that will tell me that it was lngm
[00:11:56] and so on and so on you can also use a
[00:11:58] memory palace
[00:11:59] it's a bit of a waste of space because
[00:12:01] you don't really need that much
[00:12:02] and it's so quick anyways maybe it's not
[00:12:04] even necessary but if you feel better
[00:12:06] about
[00:12:06] storing lando calories and chewing some
[00:12:09] gum in the first location of your memory
[00:12:11] palace
[00:12:11] that's totally fine once i'm done
[00:12:13] memorizing sequence for the corners
[00:12:14] i'll then look and do the same thing
[00:12:16] with the edges
[00:12:18] and so i'll start by looking at the
[00:12:19] buffer zone of the edges which is here
[00:12:21] and say to myself what is the letter
[00:12:23] piece of where that should go and kind
[00:12:24] of continue the sequence on from there
[00:12:26] creating new words maybe putting in a
[00:12:28] memory palace and then that's it
[00:12:30] i do the edges first setting up each
[00:12:32] letter doing the algorithm the t
[00:12:34] perm until i've completed all the edges
[00:12:36] then i do the same for the corners
[00:12:40] now there is one thing you have to be
[00:12:41] careful of which is called parody
[00:12:43] if your sequence of letters
[00:12:46] and you'll know this as soon as you
[00:12:48] memorize the corners if it's odd
[00:12:50] meaning you have all pairs and then one
[00:12:52] extra letter
[00:12:53] then you have to have
[00:12:56] an odd amount for the edges as well if
[00:12:59] you have
[00:13:00] odd and even then you've messed up if
[00:13:02] one is even then the other one should be
[00:13:03] even if
[00:13:04] one's odd the other should be odd now if
[00:13:06] it's odd
[00:13:07] once you've solved the edges and you're
[00:13:09] about to do the last step which is to
[00:13:11] solve the corners you have to do one
[00:13:12] more algorithm so the algorithm is
[00:13:14] basically an r perm
[00:13:15] and it goes like this
[00:13:30] so three algorithms seriously that's it
[00:13:31] that's all you got to memorize
[00:13:33] and then you can start doing this and
[00:13:35] now here's a video of me

[00:15:04] of skillshare premium anyways back to
[00:15:06] the video
[00:15:08] i'm going to go through this and figure
[00:15:09] out what the sequence is that we have to
[00:15:11] memorize how i would memorize it and
[00:15:12] then how we would solve it
[00:15:14] okay so the first thing i do when i pick
[00:15:16] it up is i make sure that i know where
[00:15:18] my
[00:15:19] top and front is remember i said white
[00:15:21] is always on top
[00:15:22] and then green is always facing me that
[00:15:25] way
[00:15:26] i never lose that orientation obviously
[00:15:28] you don't want to spin the cube when
[00:15:29] you're blindfolded because then you're
[00:15:30] going to lose where you are you always
[00:15:31] want to make sure that you
[00:15:32] don't change how you hold it
[00:15:36] all right so i'm going to do corners
[00:15:38] first so i look in the buffer zone here
[00:15:40] and i say where does that go okay that's
[00:15:42] the white
[00:15:43] green red piece that should go here
[00:15:45] right
[00:15:46] which is what letter abc so i memorized
[00:15:49] c
[00:15:51] then i asked myself where does this
[00:15:52] piece go where does this sticker go
[00:15:54] which is the red green yellow right this
[00:15:56] is the red face
[00:15:57] with the green and the yellow so that
[00:15:59] red piece should go here which is the
[00:16:01] letter
[00:16:01] p right mnop so i have
[00:16:04] cp okay so i might picture like
[00:16:08] a cap okay that's in my mind right now
[00:16:10] then i ask where does this go
[00:16:12] this goes to the red here with the blue
[00:16:16] and yellow so that's o then i go
[00:16:20] to this piece goes to up here and the
[00:16:23] red face with the blue and the white
[00:16:24] that's n so i have cap on on just
[00:16:28] happens to be a word so i'm going to
[00:16:29] imagine someone putting a cap on
[00:16:31] and then where does the n go this goes
[00:16:34] to
[00:16:34] d over here and where does this go
[00:16:38] this goes to actually down here x
[00:16:42] and notice that this is my buffer piece
[00:16:43] so i know well i think that i'm done
[00:16:46] right as i'm doing this i usually i will
[00:16:49] have my fingers
[00:16:50] holding on to all the pieces i've
[00:16:52] touched and if i did that that would be
[00:16:55] these four and then notice that
[00:16:58] i missed this one but it's solved that's
[00:17:00] where it should be so i'm actually good
[00:17:02] i'm done
[00:17:04] okay so i had cap on and then dx
[00:17:09] all right so now we're gonna do the
[00:17:10] edges and we start with the buffer zone
[00:17:12] and say
[00:17:12] okay where does this piece go and look
[00:17:15] this is actually
[00:17:16] in the right place yes it's flipped
[00:17:18] right the red should be here
[00:17:20] but this is the buffer zone we don't put
[00:17:22] things in the buffer zone that go in the
[00:17:23] buffer zone
[00:17:24] so what was the rule if the buffer zone
[00:17:26] piece was already there
[00:17:28] we just choose another piece anyone
[00:17:30] that's unsolved obviously you wouldn't
[00:17:32] want to choose this one because that
[00:17:33] one's actually solved
[00:17:34] but let's maybe choose j i j
[00:17:37] okay so i'm going to start with this
[00:17:39] letter next question is where does j go
[00:17:41] that's the edge of the orange and the
[00:17:43] yellow
[00:17:43] right which is should go here right
[00:17:46] and it's the yellow piece specifically
[00:17:48] so that's uvw
[00:17:49] x so i have j x i'm going to think of
[00:17:52] jacks
[00:17:53] and where does this piece go that's the
[00:17:56] yellow red which is here that's
[00:17:58] v okay where does this white blue piece
[00:18:01] go
[00:18:02] that goes up here which is a
[00:18:06] okay so i have jacksonville and va
[00:18:09] i'm gonna imagine jacksonville jaguars
[00:18:11] playing in virginia for whatever reason
[00:18:13] and then where does the a piece go here
[00:18:15] that's blue and orange which that's here
[00:18:18] that's
[00:18:18] q r okay so i have r okay and then this
[00:18:22] red green piece the red
[00:18:24] needs to go here which is mnop so i have
[00:18:27] p and then notice that i've now returned
[00:18:30] back to
[00:18:31] that j i know it's not the letter j but
[00:18:34] it's that same
[00:18:34] piece right so when i come back to the
[00:18:37] same piece that i've already used
[00:18:38] doesn't matter what sticker then my
[00:18:40] cycle is done
[00:18:42] so i usually will trace with my fingers
[00:18:44] just to make sure because i had
[00:18:45] jax va virginia and then rp
[00:18:49] which rp makes me think of like like a
[00:18:51] rep
[00:18:52] so i have jacksonville jaguars playing
[00:18:54] in virginia and doing one rep
[00:18:56] okay but is that it so let's just make
[00:18:58] sure i had j i'm gonna put my finger
[00:19:00] here
[00:19:01] x gonna put my finger there uh v
[00:19:05] sometimes it gets a bit awkward a um
[00:19:09] r and then p back here so looking at my
[00:19:12] other edges
[00:19:13] most of them are solved right this one's
[00:19:16] solved
[00:19:16] this one's solved this one's solved and
[00:19:19] this one solved so
[00:19:20] that was actually a pretty easy one so
[00:19:22] that's it
[00:19:24] jax virginia rp okay and it was even
[00:19:28] just like my corners were so i know i'm
[00:19:29] good all right so
[00:19:32] next step is to solve the edges
[00:19:35] and then when i'm done with that solve
[00:19:36] the corners okay
[00:19:38] so i have jax j x v a r p i'm gonna
[00:19:42] start with j
[00:19:43] which means i put my j piece
[00:19:46] up here and then i do my swap algorithm
[00:19:48] okay how do i put j
[00:19:50] up there without messing up these three
[00:19:53] right
[00:19:54] because it might be tempting to say oh
[00:19:56] let me put on the bottom and then move
[00:19:57] it around here and then put it on top
[00:19:59] here no
[00:20:00] because then you've messed up
[00:20:03] these guys which is where the buffer
[00:20:05] zone is you don't want to do that so
[00:20:06] i could do this i could move
[00:20:10] this layer and then pull
[00:20:13] that piece up here and now it's in the
[00:20:16] correct swap position
[00:20:17] i do the algorithm
[00:20:23] and i undo what i did before now this
[00:20:26] didn't really help
[00:20:27] because nothing's really solved yet but
[00:20:29] that was because the buffer zone piece
[00:20:31] was in its own place
[00:20:32] we just chose a letter to start it with
[00:20:33] so it doesn't really solve anything just
[00:20:35] yet
[00:20:36] now here is where the magic will happen
[00:20:37] our next letter was x which is here
[00:20:40] that one's an easy one we can just
[00:20:41] rotate it twice to put it on top
[00:20:43] and then we do the algorithm again
[00:20:48] and notice that it swapped those i put
[00:20:52] it on the bottom
[00:20:54] or do undo the setup move and notice
[00:20:57] that it's now in the correct spot
[00:20:59] okay then we do v which is here i want
[00:21:02] to put it up here so i'm going to rotate
[00:21:04] it
[00:21:06] and put it on top there it is do the
[00:21:08] algorithm again
[00:21:12] and now it's swapped them right but i
[00:21:13] have to undo what i did which is put it
[00:21:15] back on the bottom
[00:21:16] and then rotate it twice and now look
[00:21:18] this red one is now in its spot
[00:21:21] okay that's v now we do a which is this
[00:21:24] letter here
[00:21:26] that's a tricky one but i'm gonna
[00:21:29] rotate it twice so it's here rotate it
[00:21:32] over and then put it up
[00:21:34] now there it is do the algorithm
[00:21:39] and now you want to make sure that you
[00:21:40] do it the same way so put on the bottom
[00:21:42] bring it here and then i did twice there
[00:21:46] and now the a
[00:21:47] is correct okay now we do r
[00:21:50] q r that one's an easy one just bring it
[00:21:52] up here
[00:21:58] notice that it's correct now and then
[00:22:00] finally p
[00:22:01] which is m n o p
[00:22:05] so i can do this and this
[00:22:08] and now the algorithm
[00:22:13] and then put it back and notice just by
[00:22:16] doing all those letters it actually
[00:22:18] filled in that buffer piece at the very
[00:22:20] end that's how this magic works
[00:22:22] okay now we've done the edges now we're
[00:22:23] going to move on to the corner what do
[00:22:25] we have
[00:22:26] cap on dx okay so i start with c
[00:22:30] which is abc this letter i got to put it
[00:22:32] in the swap zone
[00:22:33] without messing up these three pieces
[00:22:36] here
[00:22:38] so i can do this
[00:22:41] right and there it is now i do my
[00:22:43] algorithm
[00:22:47] okay and i put it back now it's it's
[00:22:50] where it should be right
[00:22:52] then we do p which is already in
[00:22:55] the swap zone so i just do the algorithm
[00:23:00] okay that's solved now we do o
[00:23:03] m n o that's this piece so i'm going to
[00:23:05] rotate it once
[00:23:07] then do the algorithm
[00:23:11] put it back it's good right
[00:23:15] now we do n which is this piece mn
[00:23:19] rotate it twice to get it here i haven't
[00:23:21] touched these by doing that so
[00:23:23] do the algorithm
[00:23:26] and rotate it twice back to n and that's
[00:23:29] good
[00:23:30] finally we have d and x so a b c d this
[00:23:33] piece
[00:23:34] i got to put it here so i could do this
[00:23:37] that works right and then the algorithm
[00:23:43] put it back okay and now
[00:23:46] finally the x which is u v uvw x
[00:23:50] so i can rotate it once and then bring
[00:23:52] it here and now it's in that right
[00:23:54] sticker zone and do the algorithm one
[00:23:56] more time
[00:23:59] and undo it by putting it down here and
[00:24:03] back there
[00:24:07] now some of you may be satisfied with
[00:24:09] that one example
[00:24:10] some of you may want a lot more examples
[00:24:12] because there are a lot of well
[00:24:14] what if this happens and what if this
[00:24:16] happens and frankly some of you
[00:24:18] like myself may need more examples to
[00:24:20] really capture this so instead of going
[00:24:23] on for another 20 minutes in this video
[00:24:25] i'm gonna make a separate video that is
[00:24:27] purely just examples it'll be unlisted
[00:24:29] you can only access it
[00:24:31] in the description fret not i want you
[00:24:33] guys to get this
[00:24:34] but at least with that example if you
[00:24:36] could follow along and you understood
[00:24:38] everything that i said so far you should
[00:24:40] be in good shape
[00:24:41] before you go to that extra video i made
[00:24:42] though make sure you understand that
[00:24:44] example i did
[00:24:46] go through it do it in slow motion
[00:24:49] make sure you've done it a bajillion
[00:24:51] times and i'll have the actual
[00:24:53] algorithm to get your cube to look like
[00:24:56] that
[00:24:57] so you can actually follow along as i'm
[00:24:59] doing it
[00:25:00] in this video as well that'll be in the
[00:25:02] description also in the other video i'll
[00:25:04] go over some
[00:25:04] different cycles that end early and how
[00:25:07] to deal with them
[00:25:08] okay let's finish this up all right guys
[00:25:11] i hope that was instructive i hope that
[00:25:13] was really helpful
[00:25:14] and with a little bit of practice you
[00:25:16] can actually get that speed of
[00:25:18] memorization
[00:25:19] and solving this blindfolded under five
[00:25:22] minutes
[00:25:22] and with the technique i showed you the
[00:25:24] old pacman method actually i've heard of
[00:25:26] people doing it
[00:25:26] sub 60 seconds with it i'm not quite
[00:25:29] there yet i've had to do some
[00:25:31] kind of more advanced tricks and methods
[00:25:34] to get
[00:25:35] to that point maybe in a follow-up video
[00:25:36] sometime i'll show you how to do the
[00:25:38] same thing but a more advanced method
[00:25:40] the method that i currently am using
[00:25:42] although i'm switching to an even more
[00:25:44] complicated system
[00:25:45] but uh yeah i'd love to do a series of
[00:25:48] these videos
[00:25:49] but you can start with this one this
[00:25:50] will take you very far and it will
[00:25:52] wow the pants off of anybody that you
[00:25:54] show to for sure
[00:25:56] thanks for watching guys hope you liked

[00:00:38] can you say hello to the camera
[00:00:39] come back no worries so in today's video
[00:00:43] i want to introduce
[00:00:44] this little guy his name is axel he's my
[00:00:46] son and he's super cool
[00:00:48] are you super cool i got a surprise for
[00:00:50] him i got a surprise for you
[00:00:52] i want to talk about my new kids book
[00:00:55] which just came out just a few weeks ago
[00:00:57] who better to review it than this guy
[00:00:59] it was slice surprise yes so check it
[00:01:03] out
[00:01:03] [Music]
[00:01:05] this is my book it's called memory
[00:01:07] superpowers it's for young kids
[00:01:09] it's awesome in my opinion and uh
[00:01:13] what do you think this book daddy's book
[00:01:16] that's right you want to hold it
[00:01:18] no hold it no
[00:01:23] so this book in case you're curious
[00:01:25] because this video was
[00:01:26] basically just to tell you about my book
[00:01:28] in case you didn't know
[00:01:29] i have another book which i released two
[00:01:31] years ago which is
[00:01:32] designed for adults that doesn't mean
[00:01:34] it's like super mature or anything it
[00:01:36] just means
[00:01:38] it just means it was written for adults
[00:01:40] this book was written
[00:01:41] with grade school kids in mind all right
[00:01:44] so it's
[00:01:45] very simplified um it's very illustrated
[00:01:49] very colorful
[00:01:50] and to be honest i actually like it
[00:01:53] better than the original
[00:01:56] close it no so anyways the cool thing
[00:01:57] about this book in my opinion is i wrote
[00:01:59] it like a story
[00:02:01] now the memory palace the journey method
[00:02:03] which i always call it
[00:02:04] is a story when it comes down to it so
[00:02:07] what better way to teach this stuff than
[00:02:09] a fun
[00:02:10] colorful journey now to give you proof
[00:02:14] of how
[00:02:14] effective these memory techniques are
[00:02:17] you can see my little child here
[00:02:19] he's just a few months old and he's
[00:02:20] already talking he's already
[00:02:23] able to tell you animals and animal
[00:02:25] sounds
[00:02:26] and numbers can you count one eleven
[00:02:29] and animal names how old are you you're
[00:02:32] old
[00:02:33] too old such wise words huh
[00:02:36] hey where are you going do you want a
[00:02:39] snack
[00:02:40] okay have a seat go finish this
[00:02:43] commercial
[00:02:45] trying to sell some books here so you
[00:02:47] can go to school we got
[00:02:49] letter cookies what letter is that
[00:02:54] b what a genius another letter here
[00:02:57] what's that what letter is this
[00:03:01] e four five
[00:03:05] what comes next four and then
[00:03:10] tony in a nutshell
[00:03:14] for parents watching uh this is really
[00:03:16] my effort to bring memory techniques to
[00:03:18] the younger audience
[00:03:19] which i don't think is being done
[00:03:21] anywhere unfortunately so
[00:03:23] this is the next best thing especially
[00:03:24] during lockdown quarantine if you're
[00:03:26] kids studying from home i think this
[00:03:28] could really help them learn faster
[00:03:30] we'll learn parts of the periodic table
[00:03:32] times tables foreign languages
[00:03:35] states and their capitals all the
[00:03:37] presidents how to remember names
[00:03:40] speeches poems what else
[00:03:44] yeah couldn't have said it any better
[00:03:45] myself so

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5Mzu3-cqMc

[00:00:20] that there are over 100 000 of you
[00:00:24] that care to watch the videos that i
[00:00:26] make that is just
[00:00:28] i don't get it but thank you every
[00:00:30] single one of you i have to say thank
[00:00:32] you i'm
[00:00:32] so grateful that um you've clicked that
[00:00:35] button to subscribe
[00:00:37] that you liked my video enough to do
[00:00:39] that um
[00:00:41] i can't thank you enough and i wouldn't
[00:00:42] be here without you guys
[00:00:46] now for those of you new to my channel
[00:00:48] my name is nelson dallas i'm a four-time
[00:00:50] us memory champion that means i
[00:00:53] memorized in competitions i've won these
[00:00:55] competitions i've trained my memory to
[00:00:57] get
[00:00:58] to the point where i am and i figured in
[00:01:01] celebration
[00:01:02] of this milestone personally it's a big
[00:01:05] deal for me
[00:01:06] i figured why not show me taking this
[00:01:09] human benchmark test
[00:01:10] which has been going around the internet
[00:01:12] i've seen tons of videos of
[00:01:14] all sorts of influencers and youtubers
[00:01:16] taking these
[00:01:17] tests and doing well doing bad
[00:01:20] whatever as a memory champion you'd
[00:01:23] think i do
[00:01:23] well on at least some of them the memory
[00:01:26] ones
[00:01:27] figured it could be a fun little
[00:01:28] exercise and
[00:01:30] hopefully it's not too embarrassing
[00:01:32] enough stalling
[00:01:33] let's dive into this just a heads up
[00:01:35] this video is sponsored there'll be an
[00:01:37] ad in the middle
[00:01:38] and i'll let you know before it hits and
[00:01:40] you guys can skip it or watch it if you
[00:01:42] like
[00:01:43] thanks pays the bills
[00:01:55] all right let's get started so i have a
[00:01:57] fresh account here
[00:01:59] no stats um i figured we start with the
[00:02:02] stuff that i know i'm probably gonna be
[00:02:04] bad at
[00:02:05] let's maybe start with uh hearing i
[00:02:08] don't think this is going to be very
[00:02:09] good i blame my youth i was in a punk
[00:02:11] band for a long time never wore earbuds
[00:02:13] and i blasted music in my car really
[00:02:16] loud way more
[00:02:17] than i should have and uh went to a lot
[00:02:20] of concerts so
[00:02:21] yeah so a high frequency sound will play
[00:02:25] click as soon as you hear the sound
[00:02:36] yeah about that it was a few hurts
[00:02:39] before that but
[00:02:40] not great 38.7 percentile
[00:02:43] but i'm not surprised all right next
[00:02:46] let's do
[00:02:46] reaction time uh when the red box turns
[00:02:49] green
[00:02:50] click as quickly as you can click
[00:02:53] anywhere to start
[00:02:57] all right here we go
[00:03:07] nice nice 20 milliseconds that was a
[00:03:10] fluke i
[00:03:11] i jumped but whatever
[00:03:20] yes 65 milliseconds
[00:03:26] obviously 189. anyways i'll save that
[00:03:30] score
[00:03:32] that's not bad 89 percentile i'll say
[00:03:35] that with an average of under 200
[00:03:36] milliseconds granted i kind of
[00:03:39] played the game or gamed the game
[00:03:42] but a score is a score right yep all
[00:03:44] right next let's do aim trainer
[00:03:48] so i gotta hit the target 30 times as
[00:03:50] quickly as i can
[00:03:52] click the target above to begin okay
[00:03:53] here we go
[00:04:13] 539 milliseconds
[00:04:16] i have no idea if that's fast or not
[00:04:18] whatever i'm going to save that
[00:04:22] oh that was bad 30.9 percentile
[00:04:26] yeah all right here we go
[00:04:30] ah 603 no i'm trying again
[00:04:34] five six five that's still slower right
[00:04:36] all right let's try it one more time
[00:04:38] 571. [ __ ] i'm gonna try one time
[00:04:44] let me try one more time 559. what's
[00:04:47] average here
[00:04:48] that's a little higher okay let me save
[00:04:50] that yeah still the same
[00:04:52] 30.9 percentile okay
[00:04:55] all right next up let's do typing i'm
[00:04:58] not a great
[00:04:59] typist but so be it here we go
[00:05:12] 77 words per minute i think that's good
[00:05:16] i don't know let's save that score
[00:05:19] all right 87.5 and now
[00:05:22] for something different i'd like to
[00:05:24] thank my sponsor brain
[00:05:25] armor for sponsoring this video without
[00:05:27] them a lot of this content that you see
[00:05:29] on this channel would not
[00:05:31] exist they are kind enough to supply me
[00:05:34] with
[00:05:35] something that i take every single day
[00:05:37] and that
[00:05:38] is dha omega-3 in a supplement form
[00:05:41] i've been taking it since 2012 when they
[00:05:45] actually sponsored the u.s memory
[00:05:46] championship back then i didn't know of
[00:05:48] that i wasn't too
[00:05:49] into diet for my brain health but that
[00:05:51] year changed everything
[00:05:53] i feel sharper less foggy in my head and
[00:05:56] i can really notice differences when i
[00:05:58] don't take it
[00:05:59] for whatever reason if i run out or i'm
[00:06:02] traveling and i didn't bring it
[00:06:03] i was gonna say i forgot it can happen
[00:06:06] you can get dha omega 3 from certain
[00:06:08] foods
[00:06:08] but it's really hard to get quality and
[00:06:11] the amount that you need
[00:06:12] um so i suggest taking it in the form of
[00:06:14] a supplement and
[00:06:16] while brain armor is not the only one
[00:06:17] it's the one i like i like their
[00:06:19] messaging
[00:06:20] and i like their branding and it just
[00:06:22] aligns with who i am as a person so
[00:06:25] if you want a 15 discount check out the
[00:06:27] link
[00:06:28] below or you can use the code nelson to
[00:06:30] get that
[00:06:31] percentage off now back to our regular
[00:06:34] programming
[00:06:36] all right let's continue i actually did
[00:06:38] another typing test and i got 81 which
[00:06:41] bumped my
[00:06:42] average up to 78 which bumped my
[00:06:45] thing up a half percent i think i'm 87.5
[00:06:48] or maybe that was the same
[00:06:50] i don't remember all right let's get on
[00:06:51] to the interesting stuff which is like
[00:06:54] memory let's do visual memory
[00:06:58] ah so this is the one this is like a
[00:07:01] matrix kind of thing where they
[00:07:03] show squares lit up they turn around you
[00:07:05] gotta click them and the
[00:07:06] board gets larger not great at this i've
[00:07:09] done this before
[00:07:10] so let's see
[00:07:14] okay i can do that little tetris pieces
[00:07:18] here
[00:07:19] okay okay a little more spread out
[00:07:30] okay
[00:07:32] [Music]
[00:07:33] it's interesting how it like sears on
[00:07:35] your brain
[00:07:36] for a split second then it's gone you
[00:07:39] have to act on that
[00:07:47] [Music]
[00:07:55] [Music]
[00:08:04] i got it yes never gonna get this one
[00:08:12] yeah that's it level 13.
[00:08:15] i'll keep that 81.4
[00:08:20] ah let's try one more time
[00:08:42] [Music]
[00:09:01] [Music]
[00:09:03] ah damn
[00:09:11] [Music]
[00:09:16] yes i did it that's it that's all i need
[00:09:19] that's gonna bump me up uh who cares if
[00:09:22] i get this i'm never gonna get that
[00:09:24] nice level 14 baby
[00:09:30] that's better all right 13 and a half
[00:09:31] averages to 13 and a half points
[00:09:34] 88.3 i'm okay with that
[00:09:37] all right we got three more these are
[00:09:38] memory tests so
[00:09:40] let's maybe do a verbal memory
[00:09:44] you'll be shown words one at a time if
[00:09:46] you've seen a word during the test click
[00:09:48] see
[00:09:48] if it's newer click new
[00:09:52] okay
[00:09:56] all right so here we go
[00:10:21] [Music]
[00:10:22] ah 181 words
[00:10:25] all right i think that's pretty good oh
[00:10:27] hell yeah 100 percentile
[00:10:30] nice all right now we're going to do
[00:10:32] numbers the average person can remember
[00:10:35] seven numbers at once can you do more
[00:10:39] yes i can well i hope so let's see what
[00:10:42] people are getting average around
[00:10:44] 10 9 10 and then the max here
[00:10:47] caps at 18. hopefully we can get up
[00:10:49] there some
[00:10:50] close to 18 or more let's go all right
[00:10:53] one
[00:10:55] one 52
[00:10:59] that's marty mcfly nice
[00:11:06] did i miss a digit i missed a digit
[00:11:09] damn it i'll take it what's that
[00:11:14] 99.9 percentile
[00:11:18] i'm pissed at that i know i could have
[00:11:19] gotten more
[00:11:22] all right we can do this six
[00:11:26] clearly i've been looking at cameras
[00:11:28] that's why there's ads for cameras
[00:11:31] 65 okay easy
[00:11:35] 760. that's easy
[00:11:41] 3405
[00:11:48] [Music]
[00:11:54] easy
[00:11:57] [Music]
[00:12:08] ah
[00:12:13] [Music]
[00:12:15] 18 now okay
[00:12:18] so ball is
[00:12:24] this is
[00:12:45] [Music]
[00:12:50] um
[00:12:55] one two three four five six seven eight
[00:12:57] nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
[00:12:59] fifty sixty five
[00:13:00] eighteen nice okay here we go 19.
[00:13:20] [Music]
[00:13:30] no damn it all right that's fine let's
[00:13:33] save that
[00:13:36] oh wait 18.5 oh that put me in the
[00:13:39] hundred percent out
[00:13:40] i'll take it
[00:13:44] all right and last but not least we're
[00:13:46] going to do this chimp test
[00:13:48] which yeah i've seen this before it's
[00:13:53] it's where you have to click the squares
[00:13:56] in the order that
[00:13:57] they are starting from one and they get
[00:14:00] harder and harder
[00:14:01] i've seen the chimpanzees do this and
[00:14:03] they are really fast at it way faster
[00:14:05] than humans
[00:14:09] yeah it's pretty crazy all right let's
[00:14:11] try it
[00:14:13] okay that's pretty straightforward one
[00:14:16] two three
[00:14:17] four
[00:14:20] one two three four five oh okay so now
[00:14:24] it'll
[00:14:25] hide the numbers that makes sense

[00:16:17] oh man i'm done to be honest i'm just
[00:16:24] i quit save that score
[00:16:27] 100 percentile okay cool all right
[00:16:30] and there we have it the memory stuff
[00:16:33] was mostly 100
[00:16:34] the visual memory with the matrix could
[00:16:36] have been better
[00:16:37] maybe if i had gotten 14 and not 13 that
[00:16:41] first time because it averaged
[00:16:42] i would have been higher typing was okay
[00:16:46] uh reaction time was actually better
[00:16:48] than i thought but i kind of hacked that
[00:16:50] and then hearing sucked and and the
[00:16:54] speed of reaction to the aiming was bad
[00:16:57] too
[00:16:58] not bad anyways guys thanks for watching
[00:17:00] i hope that was interesting
[00:17:02] a little fun little test to commemorate

[00:17:26] grow this into a real channel

=== ♦️ The SMALLEST CARDS In The World ♠️ (I memorized them!!) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmn9TEXqJWM

[00:00:07] [Music]
[00:00:13] [Music]
[00:00:14] so
[00:00:20] [Music]
[00:00:31] this is jenna and she has something i've
[00:00:34] been after for
[00:00:35] quite some time my tiny deck
[00:00:38] of cards so janna has this
[00:00:41] little charm necklace that contains
[00:00:45] the smallest cards i've ever seen in my
[00:00:48] life
[00:00:49] possibly the smallest in the entire
[00:00:51] world now i've memorized a lot of cards
[00:00:54] in my life
[00:00:56] but i want to memorize the smallest one
[00:01:00] so where did you get this thing by the
[00:01:01] way um i found it
[00:01:03] i did a search for it um i'm not sure
[00:01:07] how i discovered it i must have found
[00:01:10] someone wearing it on instagram or
[00:01:12] something but obviously there were no
[00:01:14] tags
[00:01:15] no like sources so i kind of just did a
[00:01:18] crazy google search for like
[00:01:20] 14 karat tiny deck of cards
[00:01:24] charm and um yeah i found a couple on
[00:01:26] etsy and i think i got this one off ebay
[00:01:29] but um i think it's from uh the
[00:01:33] 50s i want to say and it's just it's
[00:01:36] like
[00:01:36] it's vintage yeah
[00:01:40] and you've never checked if all the
[00:01:41] cards are there right i have not
[00:01:43] i'm too scared to to touch them but
[00:01:46] they're
[00:01:47] they're in there there's a bunch of
[00:01:48] little thin
[00:01:50] yeah all right little baby cards
[00:01:53] so we counted all the cards to make sure
[00:01:55] that they were all accounted for
[00:01:57] and we counted exactly 52 although
[00:02:01] one was a joker and there was no seven
[00:02:03] of clubs
[00:02:04] we got all the cards in order now the
[00:02:06] only one like i said
[00:02:08] that was missing was the seven of clubs
[00:02:10] but we just made that whatever the joker
[00:02:12] is since there was only one joker which
[00:02:14] was very strange all right so for those
[00:02:17] of you wondering how i'm gonna approach
[00:02:18] memorizing this deck of cards the answer
[00:02:20] is
[00:02:20] like i always do p-a-o person action
[00:02:24] object
[00:02:24] um i have a more complex system but i
[00:02:27] don't think i'm gonna bother with it
[00:02:28] here
[00:02:28] i'm just gonna do three cards per
[00:02:30] location in a memory palace
[00:02:33] and then yeah any questions jana
[00:02:39] [Music]
[00:02:40] how long is this going to take you i
[00:02:42] don't know a few minutes
[00:02:44] a minute no you can do this in like 30
[00:02:47] seconds
[00:02:48] yeah but we'll see these are very small
[00:02:52] size doesn't matter
[00:02:56] let's keep it pg on my channel okay so
[00:02:58] now we verified all the cards are there
[00:03:00] i'm gonna have janna shuffle them
[00:03:02] basically move them around with the
[00:03:04] tweezers
[00:03:05] and then i'm going to memorize them no
[00:03:08] rush
[00:03:08] just going to memorize the smallest deck
[00:03:10] of cards in the world
[00:03:12] no oh yeah that's good actually
[00:03:21] [Music]
[00:04:00] all right okay here we go um let me know
[00:04:02] if i'm wrong
[00:04:03] starting from the beginning uh we have

=== The Knight's Tour (chess puzzle) - Tutorial ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1ZtjLDog7M

[00:00:00] what's up guys nelson dallas here very
[00:00:02] casual video today
[00:00:04] we're going to talk about chess again if
[00:00:07] you haven't seen my last chess video
[00:00:08] make sure to check it out in that video
[00:00:10] i taught you how to memorize an entire
[00:00:12] chessboard
[00:00:13] but now we're just dealing with this one
[00:00:16] little guy
[00:00:17] the knight
[00:00:31] a famous little math problem called the
[00:00:33] knights tour
[00:00:34] now i was introduced to this about a
[00:00:36] year ago i was on
[00:00:37] a show called brain games brain for all
[00:00:39] different types of people
[00:00:41] and i met this mentalist who was telling
[00:00:44] me about this cool demonstration he did
[00:00:46] he could take
[00:00:47] the knight and from any point on the
[00:00:49] board
[00:00:50] touch every other point on the board as
[00:00:53] well
[00:00:53] all 64 points without repeating himself
[00:00:56] and without having to jump illegally i
[00:00:58] haven't found any good videos on how to
[00:01:00] do that yet on youtube so i figured i
[00:01:01] might as well give you guys one on top
[00:01:03] of that i'll give you guys a few
[00:01:04] variations
[00:01:05] depending on how deep you want to go so
[00:01:07] the first version will be the easiest
[00:01:09] and that will be only starting from one
[00:01:11] of the four corners of the board
[00:01:13] now the second way a little harder is if
[00:01:15] you ask a viewer or someone you want to
[00:01:17] impress
[00:01:18] choose any square to start on so you can
[00:01:20] put the
[00:01:21] night anywhere and complete the night's
[00:01:23] tour from that starting square
[00:01:25] then i'll show you another one where you
[00:01:27] can ask them to choose the starting
[00:01:28] point
[00:01:29] and the end point and be able to
[00:01:31] complete the entire night's tour
[00:01:33] from start to finish and then finally
[00:01:36] because this is such a mentalist's
[00:01:38] kind of demonstration i'll show you how
[00:01:40] the mentalists do it i think it's
[00:01:41] cheating well of course it's cheating
[00:01:43] 27 33 18.
[00:01:47] let's clear up the top now one i don't
[00:01:49] like that way because it's kind of a
[00:01:51] hack but there is a bit of memory
[00:01:52] involved so i do like that i think the
[00:01:54] other ways are cooler because you're
[00:01:55] actually figuring it out
[00:01:56] as you go so you can think about it it's
[00:01:58] a nice little puzzle anyways
[00:02:00] let's get started
[00:02:03] so let's first talk about what
[00:02:05] constitutes a legal move for this
[00:02:07] piece and basically it makes an l shape
[00:02:09] that's the easiest way i think to
[00:02:11] remember it
[00:02:11] and you can remember that by either from
[00:02:14] the point of origin
[00:02:15] going up down left or right in any
[00:02:18] direction by
[00:02:19] one and then perpendicular to it by
[00:02:23] two and you can also do the flip in any
[00:02:25] of the directions
[00:02:26] left right up or down you can go two
[00:02:29] pieces
[00:02:29] and then one that sounded really
[00:02:32] complicated coming out of my mouth but
[00:02:34] from the diagram it should make sense
[00:02:35] one thing to note that whatever
[00:02:37] square you start on whatever color it is
[00:02:39] black or white
[00:02:41] it's going to end on the opposite color
[00:02:43] it has to
[00:02:44] otherwise it won't work for the first
[00:02:46] two variations of how to do this it's
[00:02:47] not really going to matter because
[00:02:49] nobody's telling us where to end but for
[00:02:51] the third one the more difficult one
[00:02:54] you're telling the viewer choose a
[00:02:55] starting and end point
[00:02:57] so all you have to make sure to tell
[00:02:58] them is that those two starting and end
[00:03:00] points have to be different colored
[00:03:02] squares and if they don't like that just
[00:03:04] tell them that mathematically it is
[00:03:05] impossible to do
[00:03:07] otherwise and in terms of rules again
[00:03:09] you can't touch a square
[00:03:10] that you've already been to the problem
[00:03:12] here is that you're going to go around
[00:03:14] and then you're going to get trapped
[00:03:15] right you're going to get to a point on
[00:03:16] the board where
[00:03:17] shoot you can't make it out of there
[00:03:19] without having to touch a square you've
[00:03:20] already touched
[00:03:21] and that's what we're trying to think
[00:03:22] about before we
[00:03:24] make our moves it's really a nice
[00:03:26] elegant solution when you see it
[00:03:29] it feels nice when you solve it without
[00:03:31] having messed up
[00:03:34] all right so let's do the first
[00:03:35] variation and now the easiest part about
[00:03:37] this one
[00:03:38] is you're just starting in one of the
[00:03:40] four corners doesn't matter which one
[00:03:42] but you got to stick to these two rules
[00:03:44] one is that you got gotta stay to the
[00:03:45] outermost
[00:03:46] square that you possibly can the second
[00:03:49] one is you gotta keep moving
[00:03:50] in a counterclockwise or clockwise
[00:03:53] direction it doesn't matter which
[00:03:54] direction you choose
[00:03:55] but you gotta stick with it throughout
[00:03:57] the game until you're done
[00:03:59] so i think the best way to show you this
[00:04:01] is
[00:04:02] just on an app that i use to practice
[00:04:06] all right so i typically will start from
[00:04:09] the top
[00:04:10] left i think that's honestly the easiest
[00:04:12] place to start to understand this
[00:04:13] and then we'll go counter-clockwise
[00:04:15] around the board but again
[00:04:17] you have to start in one of the corners
[00:04:19] that's the
[00:04:20] the easy way here not much to think
[00:04:22] about there okay so
[00:04:23] there's my first piece now next what do
[00:04:26] we do
[00:04:26] well we keep those two rules in mind i
[00:04:29] gotta stay on the outermost of the board
[00:04:31] that i
[00:04:31] possibly can and i gotta keep moving
[00:04:33] around the board in this
[00:04:34] counterclockwise
[00:04:35] fashion so if i look at the possible
[00:04:37] moves here
[00:04:38] it's either down two over one or over
[00:04:42] two down one but that one would go
[00:04:44] clockwise i'm
[00:04:45] trying to go counterclockwise now again
[00:04:47] you can do it the other way but
[00:04:48] we're sticking to counter-clockwise and
[00:04:50] that's the way we're doing it so
[00:04:52] down two over one that's my second move
[00:04:55] and we continue
[00:04:56] i gotta stay on the outside of the board
[00:04:57] so that would be staying and hugging
[00:04:59] against the rim here
[00:05:00] still going down counterclockwise here
[00:05:04] now we go down there then here
[00:05:08] now we're in the corner here we gotta
[00:05:10] turn back up right so
[00:05:11] up here and here
[00:05:15] here and now we're coming around right
[00:05:19] this all makes sense and now here i'm
[00:05:20] still coming around but i want to stay
[00:05:22] at the outermost edge so that would take
[00:05:24] me there
[00:05:25] right and then that would alternate
[00:05:27] right there
[00:05:29] there there
[00:05:32] okay we're coming around this first few
[00:05:34] rounds is actually pretty easy and it
[00:05:36] looks very nice and symmetrical the
[00:05:37] pieces i've been to
[00:05:39] when you start getting when you start
[00:05:41] running out of pieces in the
[00:05:42] outside it gets tricky in the middle but
[00:05:44] you can make it through
[00:05:46] okay this is kind of weird because i
[00:05:48] can't say as outermost as i'd like to
[00:05:50] because their piece has already been
[00:05:51] touched
[00:05:52] so to do that what my only possible move
[00:05:55] is really there
[00:05:56] right that's the closest to the edge
[00:05:58] that hasn't been taken
[00:06:00] and now i can go back to the very edge
[00:06:01] there and can kind of continue
[00:06:04] very close to the edge
[00:06:08] if you don't follow me you can always
[00:06:10] slow this down
[00:06:12] in that corner now and then we're up
[00:06:14] here
[00:06:15] up there and now we're gonna have to
[00:06:17] kind of fill in the center board watch
[00:06:19] so this is the next move i can make now
[00:06:22] i have to continue kind of curving
[00:06:24] around
[00:06:26] but i'm kind of filling in this center
[00:06:28] part here
[00:06:29] then that would go here and then it's
[00:06:32] kind of getting weird here
[00:06:33] but if i keep those two rules in mind
[00:06:35] okay it's got to go still that way
[00:06:37] but but as outermost as i can which
[00:06:39] would be this piece
[00:06:41] right and then that would take me here
[00:06:44] and it's tempting to want to go down
[00:06:46] here but that would bring me out of that
[00:06:48] kind of curve i got to keep going up and
[00:06:50] turning
[00:06:50] so that brings me here and then
[00:06:53] outermost would be
[00:06:54] here and now you can see it's going to
[00:06:57] start connecting with the outer pieces
[00:06:58] here
[00:06:59] right we're back in something that
[00:07:01] almost looks
[00:07:03] really easy to follow and you know
[00:07:06] you've done it right when you see this
[00:07:07] little y
[00:07:08] in the middle there you'll see why in a
[00:07:10] second
[00:07:11] okay i'm just filling in those pieces
[00:07:14] boom
[00:07:21] right right try it out there's a few
[00:07:23] apps like i said you can download to try
[00:07:25] this
[00:07:25] i'll also show you a link down below
[00:07:27] where you can try it online and just try
[00:07:29] to see if you can fill in the whole
[00:07:30] square
[00:07:31] without messing up all right so now the
[00:07:35] next
[00:07:35] variation a little more complicated and
[00:07:38] this is where
[00:07:39] the viewer or someone you're wanting to
[00:07:41] show this to
[00:07:42] chooses the starting position for you
[00:07:44] now obviously one of the starting points
[00:07:46] could be
[00:07:47] one of the corners but it's more likely
[00:07:48] that they'll choose something
[00:07:50] complicated in the middle
[00:07:51] so to do this you just need to be
[00:07:52] familiar with four quadrants
[00:07:55] of the chess board i'll go over that in
[00:07:57] a second and then these four
[00:07:59] what i'll call systems once you have
[00:08:01] those it's honestly like child's play
[00:08:03] no joke so let's start with the
[00:08:05] quadrants okay
[00:08:07] obviously a chess board is eight by
[00:08:09] eight 64 squares
[00:08:11] so if you divide that in little
[00:08:12] quadrants right you're gonna have these
[00:08:15] little four by fours four of them
[00:08:18] right we can consider the top left one
[00:08:20] quadrant one
[00:08:22] top right quadrant two bottom left three
[00:08:25] and bottom right four
[00:08:26] all right so let's start with the first
[00:08:28] system and that will be what i call
[00:08:30] a left-handed diamond okay what does
[00:08:32] that look like so
[00:08:33] let's start with just one of the
[00:08:35] quadrants okay that's going to be
[00:08:37] one piece in the corner of the quadrant
[00:08:40] and then two pieces
[00:08:43] there and you'll notice that if i'm
[00:08:45] looking at the board this looks like a
[00:08:47] diamond
[00:08:48] right and it's left handed meaning it
[00:08:51] starts at the top
[00:08:52] left it's kind of pointed towards the
[00:08:54] left
[00:08:55] now this is just one quadrant so you can
[00:08:57] imagine these same
[00:08:58] diamonds mapped across each of the
[00:09:01] different quadrants
[00:09:02] right so i'm going to have one i'll do
[00:09:04] them in different colors so it's clear
[00:09:06] i'm gonna have one in quadrant two the
[00:09:09] exact same structure
[00:09:11] right i'm gonna have one in quadrant
[00:09:13] three the exact same structure
[00:09:19] right and then finally i'll have one in
[00:09:22] that fourth quadrant
[00:09:26] now naturally if there's a left-handed
[00:09:28] diamond there's going to be a
[00:09:29] right-handed diamond that's the system
[00:09:32] number two
[00:09:32] so all that is is really the same as
[00:09:34] this but kind of
[00:09:36] looking to the right so if you can
[00:09:38] imagine the same kind of formation just
[00:09:40] everything is flipped here
[00:09:44] okay now you don't have to be able to
[00:09:48] put these on a board like i'm doing this
[00:09:50] is just to visualize to understand and
[00:09:52] get a feel for
[00:09:53] what structure these kind of squares can
[00:09:56] have in terms of
[00:09:57] knights moving around them okay so two
[00:09:59] of the systems are
[00:10:01] diamonds the other two are going to be
[00:10:04] squares
[00:10:05] okay you have a left-handed square and a
[00:10:06] right-handed square now the left-handed
[00:10:08] square
[00:10:09] looks like this see that
[00:10:15] [Music]
[00:10:17] it's a square you can imagine it's kind
[00:10:18] of tilted square
[00:10:20] but it's a square nevertheless
[00:10:24] okay that's the left-handed square
[00:10:26] because it's kind of pointed to the
[00:10:27] upper left
[00:10:28] and then of course there's going to be
[00:10:30] the right handed square which is
[00:10:32] basically if i can imagine it
[00:10:33] flip that way so like this
[00:10:37] see that literally just kind of did a
[00:10:39] rotation there
[00:10:48] there we go that may seem a bit
[00:10:49] confusing it might be helpful to take
[00:10:51] your own chessboard out
[00:10:52] and make sure you visualize those as
[00:10:55] best as you can
[00:10:56] the key to being able to do this is
[00:10:58] understanding
[00:11:00] these different structures if you can
[00:11:01] see them in your mind without the colors
[00:11:03] i've overlaid here then you can do this
[00:11:06] easy
[00:11:06] all right now how does it work what do
[00:11:08] we do with these systems in these
[00:11:09] quadrants right just like the previous
[00:11:11] variation there were some rules
[00:11:13] and if you just stick to those rules
[00:11:15] you'll find the solution
[00:11:16] all right step number one rule number
[00:11:18] one is to
[00:11:20] you know wherever your piece falls let's
[00:11:22] say it starts there
[00:11:24] okay the first thing you want to do is
[00:11:26] note
[00:11:27] which quadrant and which system it is in
[00:11:30] in this example it's in the second
[00:11:32] quadrant in a right-handed square
[00:11:35] position now it doesn't matter whether
[00:11:37] it starts on any of these pieces in the
[00:11:38] square
[00:11:39] all i need to know to start is that it
[00:11:41] is in that right
[00:11:42] handed square step number two or rule
[00:11:44] number two
[00:11:45] you want to complete all four pieces
[00:11:47] within that system
[00:11:49] within that quadrant before you move on
[00:11:51] to another quadrant
[00:11:53] so obviously each of those systems in
[00:11:54] each quadrant has four squares you gotta
[00:11:56] touch
[00:11:57] so i have to make sure i hit one while i
[00:11:59] start there i gotta touch this one this
[00:12:00] one and this one
[00:12:01] before i can move on now the next rule
[00:12:04] is important
[00:12:05] so as you complete touching these other
[00:12:08] pieces within that quadrant you need to
[00:12:10] make sure that the final one
[00:12:11] will allow you to jump into another
[00:12:14] quadrant
[00:12:15] into the same system right so we're
[00:12:17] still doing the square right hand square
[00:12:20] so when i complete this whether i want
[00:12:22] to go to the black
[00:12:24] quadrant here or the blue doesn't matter
[00:12:27] i just need to make sure that i touch
[00:12:30] all of the greens before i move on to
[00:12:32] the blue or the black
[00:12:34] and i want to make sure that i land on
[00:12:36] this right
[00:12:37] hand square in that next quadrant
[00:12:39] otherwise it's all messed up
[00:12:41] okay so an example here could be
[00:12:45] let's see i want to go
[00:12:47] [Music]
[00:12:49] maybe here right then
[00:12:52] here and then here
[00:12:56] right which will allow me to traverse
[00:13:00] over here which is in the next quadrant
[00:13:03] right and then here
[00:13:06] and then here now i need to make sure to
[00:13:10] get this next one
[00:13:11] right i can't go back to this quadrant
[00:13:13] so the next logical move will take me to
[00:13:16] this third quadrant here right
[00:13:19] and then i continue here here
[00:13:22] here i want to connect into this one
[00:13:26] here here
[00:13:30] here and now i've touched all four
[00:13:32] quadrants
[00:13:33] in this right hand square system now you
[00:13:36] have to be careful because
[00:13:38] when you're done with your last square
[00:13:41] of all four quadrants of that system
[00:13:44] right hand
[00:13:45] square you have to make sure that your
[00:13:47] move your next move will take you into
[00:13:49] another quadrant
[00:13:50] and another opposite system you can't go
[00:13:53] square to square
[00:13:54] so i can't go from right hand square to
[00:13:55] left-hand square it's got to go square
[00:13:57] to diamond
[00:13:58] left or right hand diamond doesn't
[00:14:00] matter so for this one there's actually
[00:14:01] a few options i could
[00:14:03] you know connect into this
[00:14:06] left hand diamond the bottom one of
[00:14:08] quadrant one
[00:14:09] i could let's see i could go
[00:14:13] back and that's part of the quadrant
[00:14:16] three right hand diamond you have a few
[00:14:19] options and then you just repeat this
[00:14:21] procedure you know you go from square to
[00:14:23] then diamond then to square and then to
[00:14:25] diamond
[00:14:25] and by the end honestly the last tour
[00:14:28] you'll see
[00:14:29] you the path is basically there for you
[00:14:31] because you've touched all the other
[00:14:32] pieces
[00:14:33] it's really easy to figure out where to
[00:14:34] go at that point and you're just
[00:14:35] following the empty spaces
[00:14:37] so stick to those rules and you'll be
[00:14:38] able to figure out the night's tour
[00:14:40] starting at any square let's do an
[00:14:43] example
[00:14:44] let's start with i don't know i like the
[00:14:47] left hand diamond
[00:14:48] but maybe we can start in quadrant three
[00:14:52] and we have to complete all the squares
[00:14:55] in that system
[00:14:56] in that quadrant so i'm gonna go here
[00:14:59] here and here and now we've completed
[00:15:02] all four pieces
[00:15:03] next step is to then go into another
[00:15:06] quadrant the same system
[00:15:08] which i'm going to move to quadrant four
[00:15:09] here
[00:15:11] hit that top corner get all four pieces
[00:15:15] and now i'm gonna maybe move up to the
[00:15:17] second quadrant
[00:15:20] hit all those from the left diamond
[00:15:23] and then finish up the last quadrant
[00:15:27] there so we've done all the left-hand
[00:15:30] diamonds
[00:15:31] in all quadrants next step is to
[00:15:34] change to an opposite system so we need
[00:15:37] to go to a
[00:15:38] square system in a different quadrant so
[00:15:40] i'm going to jump
[00:15:41] into the third quadrant here the right
[00:15:45] hand square
[00:15:47] finish all those squares
[00:15:50] now go into the fourth quadrant down
[00:15:53] here
[00:15:58] now into the second quadrant get those
[00:16:01] four
[00:16:03] and the final quadrant here there and
[00:16:08] there now i need to go back to a diamond
[00:16:11] i already did the left hand diamond so
[00:16:12] now i'm going to do
[00:16:13] the right hand diamond and i'm going to
[00:16:16] go
[00:16:16] to back to the second
[00:16:20] quadrant get the diamond pieces there
[00:16:25] then go to let's see
[00:16:28] quadrant four get those pieces there
[00:16:32] then go into quadrant three need to be
[00:16:35] careful i
[00:16:37] go in the right order so they don't get
[00:16:39] stuck
[00:16:40] and then finally the top left quadrant
[00:16:44] to get that final diamond let's see this
[00:16:48] piece
[00:16:48] the corner and finish up there and now
[00:16:51] it's almost clear it's just the left
[00:16:53] hand square which i can just easily
[00:16:57] follow starting with the second quadrant
[00:17:01] just gotta make a little bit of sound
[00:17:04] judgment
[00:17:04] and how i traverse these
[00:17:09] quadrant three and then finally
[00:17:12] quadrant one that's it
[00:17:15] [Music]
[00:17:17] so this last variation is the most
[00:17:20] difficult and it's where the viewer
[00:17:22] chooses a starting square and a
[00:17:23] finishing square
[00:17:25] now it is a little more challenging you
[00:17:26] have to think a little bit more
[00:17:28] but really if you can do the second
[00:17:30] variation and you understand
[00:17:32] systems and the quadrants and you've
[00:17:34] practiced it enough
[00:17:35] then this variation shouldn't be that
[00:17:37] much harder you just have to really be
[00:17:39] aware
[00:17:40] of where you're starting where you're
[00:17:42] finishing what quadrant you started
[00:17:44] what system you started and which ones
[00:17:47] you end in as well
[00:17:48] i'm not going to go fully into this
[00:17:50] because i could probably make a whole
[00:17:51] other video entirely on this variation
[00:17:54] but i encourage you guys to try it
[00:17:57] and i really think that those who want
[00:17:59] to master this have to master the first
[00:18:01] two variations first and then with
[00:18:03] enough practice i think that this
[00:18:04] variation actually will be
[00:18:06] pretty intuitive if you really
[00:18:08] understand how to do the previous ones
[00:18:11] all right now finally the way mentalists
[00:18:14] do it or at least that i understand any
[00:18:16] mentalist out there please correct me if
[00:18:18] i'm wrong
[00:18:19] but this was pulled from an old book by
[00:18:22] corinda
[00:18:22] it's a famous mentalist and it's
[00:18:25] basically this so if you imagine the
[00:18:27] board is numbered one two three four
[00:18:29] five six seven eight
[00:18:30] all the way down to 64. okay the way it
[00:18:33] goes in some kind of mentalist
[00:18:34] presentation is
[00:18:35] they'll draw a grid or they'll have a
[00:18:38] grid a chessboard grid on some kind of
[00:18:40] board
[00:18:41] or on paper or whatever and
[00:18:44] they'll have it numbered 1 to 64. and
[00:18:46] without looking
[00:18:48] you know the the audience member can
[00:18:49] choose where to start
[00:18:51] position 54. and from there
[00:18:54] without looking at the board they can
[00:18:55] rattle off all the positions
[00:18:57] without even looking
[00:19:00] all they've done is memorized a sequence
[00:19:03] of numbers
[00:19:04] and no matter where they start whether
[00:19:07] they start at position 54
[00:19:09] or 1 or 7 or 64 they can go to that
[00:19:12] position
[00:19:13] in their sequence and just continue on
[00:19:15] and wrap around
[00:19:16] so that they touch all of the numbers in
[00:19:19] that order
[00:19:20] if you want to know the one specifically
[00:19:21] from corinda's book
[00:19:23] here it is so just memorize that
[00:19:26] sequence
[00:19:26] start at the number that the audience
[00:19:29] member chooses
[00:19:30] and then when you get to the end
[00:19:32] continue around until you've said all 64
[00:19:35] numbers
[00:19:36] voila you've now fooled the audience
[00:19:38] that one's kind of not very
[00:19:39] satisfying is it yeah anyways thank you
[00:19:42] guys for watching i know this was a bit
[00:19:44] of a
[00:19:45] kind of tricky technical one but i think
[00:19:47] it's a really cool math problem
[00:19:48] and really fun to actually solve
[00:19:50] yourself and of course to show off to
[00:19:52] others so try it practice it
[00:19:55] and let me know how you do in the
[00:19:56] comments below thank you guys i'm out
[00:19:58] i'll see you in the next video
[00:20:00] love you all please like share subscribe
[00:20:02] all that jazz i'm out

=== memory champ REACTS to IMPOSSIBLE memory feats (incl. BIJAY SHAHI) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78_g23Q1Amw

[00:00:00] if there's anything honestly that i've
[00:00:01] been impressed with it's how fast he can
[00:00:03] turn the pages
[00:00:09] what's up guys i'm a four-time usa
[00:00:11] memory champion so i know a little bit
[00:00:13] about
[00:00:14] how memory feats work how plausible they
[00:00:17] can be
[00:00:18] what's actually possible and what's not
[00:00:20] so i figured in this video
[00:00:22] we could take a look at some of the
[00:00:24] stuff that's posted out on the interwebs
[00:00:26] and judge it i'll give my critique on it
[00:00:30] whether it's good
[00:00:31] or bad or fake or real
[00:00:34] we'll see i've seen a lot of things over
[00:00:36] the years and it's been a mix of both
[00:00:38] some looks really impressive it's not
[00:00:41] but they are using memory techniques
[00:00:43] other situations it looks insane but
[00:00:46] it's absolutely false and fake so let's
[00:00:48] have a look at some of the videos that
[00:00:50] you guys have shared with me
[00:00:51] over the years and see what i think
[00:00:54] about them
[00:00:54] let's dive in
[00:00:58] right let's start with a little harmless
[00:00:59] one here this
[00:01:01] is senator al franken
[00:01:04] who can draw from memory
[00:01:08] the entire u.s map all the states all 50
[00:01:11] states
[00:01:12] that's pretty impressive i guess i could
[00:01:14] draw it from memory
[00:01:15] but it wouldn't be very good yeah i
[00:01:17] don't know i'd love to try that
[00:01:19] um yeah it would look pretty bad and i'm
[00:01:21] a pretty good drawer so
[00:01:23] curious to see this
[00:01:30] let's see okay this video is sped up
[00:01:32] here
[00:01:34] oh but wow okay so he starts with
[00:01:40] minnesota i think he's
[00:01:42] from minnesota so that makes sense
[00:01:54] pretty impressive i guess the hard part
[00:01:56] here is you know
[00:01:58] you may start with kind of some good
[00:02:01] outlines of the first initial states but
[00:02:03] as you add them all together
[00:02:04] you're going to veer further and further
[00:02:06] away from
[00:02:08] what the us actually looks like because
[00:02:10] you know it's hard to judge
[00:02:12] where you're putting everything compared
[00:02:13] to the whole map
[00:02:16] this is pretty good
[00:02:17] [Music]
[00:02:19] you can see some of the states there in
[00:02:21] the top right are kind of
[00:02:23] obviously he's not memorized the exact
[00:02:25] border
[00:02:27] this is pretty good
[00:02:30] [Music]
[00:02:32] okay yeah the hard part is over
[00:02:35] now he's got california
[00:02:38] and the okay that's a weird alaska
[00:02:43] all right let's back up there and let's
[00:02:45] pause this video
[00:02:47] yeah that's a pretty good usa map
[00:02:50] i consider this 100 legit
[00:02:54] but i wonder if it's just something that
[00:02:55] he's practiced over the years
[00:02:57] i could see this being something that
[00:02:59] you get better at with practice
[00:03:01] cool way to go al franken very impressed
[00:03:08] let's hear it
[00:03:17] [Music]
[00:03:26] i'm gonna pause for a second i can't
[00:03:27] even understand
[00:03:29] a single number being said there is this
[00:03:31] in english
[00:03:33] [Music]
[00:03:38] i think i heard a zero there
[00:03:50] let me start again maybe can i hear hang
[00:03:52] on
[00:03:55] okay i definitely heard a three point at
[00:03:57] the very beginning
[00:03:58] but you know look i don't doubt that
[00:04:00] this kid
[00:04:02] has memorized 500 digits that's
[00:04:05] not too hard i think he could probably
[00:04:07] do that
[00:04:08] but i'm not a big fan of these speed
[00:04:11] records
[00:04:11] when it comes to reciting information
[00:04:13] because obviously you get to the limit
[00:04:15] on how fast you can speak the
[00:04:16] information and then eventually becomes
[00:04:18] something like this where
[00:04:20] you get a are we does it have to be
[00:04:22] understood and articulated
[00:04:24] because if not then how do you freaking
[00:04:26] judge this so
[00:04:28] um i don't want to this little kid but
[00:04:31] man that's pretty that's that's a bad
[00:04:33] record sorry
[00:04:34] wanna hear the most annoying sound in
[00:04:36] the world
[00:04:41] now this is done by someone i know very
[00:04:43] well
[00:04:44] shizure he's a mongolian heck of a
[00:04:46] memorizer
[00:04:47] and he's been able to memorize a deck of
[00:04:49] cards in 12.74 seconds let's have a look
[00:04:52] he did this in 2018 at the korean memory
[00:04:56] championships
[00:04:58] so the way this works in competition is
[00:04:59] you have a shuffle deck it's been
[00:05:01] pre-shuffled by judges in the back
[00:05:04] you have a timer you pick it up the
[00:05:06] timer goes however long you look at it
[00:05:08] is how you're scored and then afterwards
[00:05:11] you have to reconstruct that deck to get
[00:05:13] the full credit all right so here it
[00:05:14] goes
[00:05:18] one two three four
[00:05:21] it's crazy
[00:05:31] nuts that's so fast this this is filmed
[00:05:34] all in one take it is a hundred percent
[00:05:36] legit
[00:05:37] at these competitions they have judges
[00:05:39] that will
[00:05:40] verify everything um there are even
[00:05:43] cameras to make sure that people aren't
[00:05:45] cheating
[00:05:46] so it's all verified very um
[00:05:52] very legit standards here so here
[00:05:56] they've cut to where he's put the deck
[00:05:58] they've cut to where he's put the other
[00:06:00] deck in the same order and now they're
[00:06:02] comparing the cards
[00:06:03] if there's no mistakes they all match
[00:06:05] then he's done it perfect which
[00:06:07] he did very impressive not sure what the
[00:06:09] next
[00:06:10] best time is i believe it's maybe 13
[00:06:12] something but yeah
[00:06:13] that was amazing that is how you
[00:06:16] memorize a deck of cards my friends
[00:06:20] oh the rubik's cube blindfolded 3x3
[00:06:24] world record which is what
[00:06:28] 15.5 seconds and that
[00:06:31] includes memorization so time starts
[00:06:34] when you pick up the
[00:06:35] cube to memorize it and then you put
[00:06:38] your blindfold on and solve it
[00:06:40] all within that time span so 15 seconds
[00:06:43] almost 16 seconds to do all of that
[00:06:46] that's nuts let's see this guy i've
[00:06:48] never seen this before
[00:06:57] corners the corners look good
[00:07:00] six
[00:07:15] record single but six seconds to
[00:07:17] memorize the cube
[00:07:19] and then nine seconds ten seconds to
[00:07:21] solve it
[00:07:23] that's crazy isn't ten seconds i mean no
[00:07:26] i know the world record is kind of like
[00:07:27] three or four seconds but
[00:07:29] solving a rubik's cube in 10 seconds or
[00:07:31] is already elite
[00:07:33] now you're doing it blindfolded are you
[00:07:35] kidding me
[00:07:36] that's nuts wow
[00:07:41] so there are these crazy records for
[00:07:45] beating video games it's called speed
[00:07:46] running
[00:07:47] and one of the classic ones is mario 64.
[00:07:50] for nintendo 64. you guys remember that
[00:07:52] there's all sorts of records and
[00:07:54] and categories depending on how you beat
[00:07:56] the game with how many stars all that
[00:07:58] stuff
[00:07:59] that's with your eyes open there are
[00:08:01] apparently
[00:08:02] blindfolded solves of this i don't even
[00:08:04] know how that's done
[00:08:07] let's see let's fast forward a bit here
[00:08:15] okay i guess to get there is maybe not
[00:08:19] too difficult
[00:08:21] just it's almost a straight line
[00:08:24] but still okay now he's in the castle
[00:08:34] hang on he so i guess you hug the wall
[00:08:38] but
[00:08:38] still you'd have to know not to turn
[00:08:41] immediately left because there was that
[00:08:42] edge of the wall
[00:08:45] i don't know is he doing it by sound
[00:08:46] cues okay this is nuts
[00:08:52] okay so clearly he used that fence and
[00:08:54] this sign
[00:08:56] as cues
[00:08:59] okay so now he's doing okay that's
[00:09:06] unfortunate
[00:09:08] so he must have known or pro i guess
[00:09:10] he's practiced this a ton so he knows
[00:09:12] that
[00:09:12] in that case two or three backflips sets
[00:09:14] him up
[00:09:15] to be in line but still have
[00:09:20] i think this is this is legit obviously
[00:09:22] look at his
[00:09:23] blindfold but this must have taken a ton
[00:09:26] of practice okay he missed the
[00:09:30] how does he come back how how does he
[00:09:32] know
[00:09:34] he's got to be doing it by some sound i
[00:09:36] don't know
[00:09:38] that's crazy i'm gonna have to come back
[00:09:39] to this video and and do something more
[00:09:41] in-depth this is insane to me
[00:09:43] i give it a legit on the nelson ometer
[00:09:46] damn impressive too
[00:09:50] i've been getting so many emails about
[00:09:53] this guy
[00:09:54] um i don't know how do i pronounce his
[00:09:56] name bj
[00:09:58] jaya shahi vijaya shahi
[00:10:01] he's dubbed the memory king of nepal
[00:10:04] he's basically
[00:10:05] i think from what i've read claiming
[00:10:07] that he can memorize
[00:10:09] a thousand page book in under 10 minutes
[00:10:12] okay so this is all in nepalese i don't
[00:10:16] understand it but
[00:10:18] no don't tell me he's going to memorize
[00:10:20] this book
[00:10:21] first of all i want to know where this
[00:10:22] book comes from who gave it to him how
[00:10:24] is it selected
[00:10:26] i also want to know is that book legit
[00:10:29] are all the pages different is it an
[00:10:30] actual book or is it a gimmick book for
[00:10:33] a mentalist showing
[00:10:34] of this type who's this guy on the left
[00:10:38] right and then how is he going to recall
[00:10:40] it i don't know if they're explained and
[00:10:41] nepalese here but for me it's not clear
[00:10:44] now let's watch him actually memorize
[00:10:46] the book they have chosen a more
[00:10:49] obnoxious sized book i would have been
[00:10:52] impressed with like
[00:10:53] a thin book
[00:10:57] i guess the the first two pages don't
[00:10:59] count
[00:11:01] [Music]
[00:11:07] okay and he just ripped a page
[00:11:12] wait a minute did he just he just ripped
[00:11:15] the page
[00:11:15] and then looked through the grip to the
[00:11:18] page before it
[00:11:19] not the page he ripped
[00:11:33] now to be honest uh i don't even really
[00:11:36] need to watch more of this this is uh
[00:11:38] this is a demonstration to in my opinion
[00:11:41] take advantage of people
[00:11:43] who don't know any better to believe um
[00:11:46] this is
[00:11:46] well he's not even looking at the pages
[00:11:49] completely it doesn't look like he's
[00:11:50] even processing
[00:11:51] both sides and like i said when you rip
[00:11:53] the page you like totally ignored it and
[00:11:55] then what's what's
[00:11:56] what's the things he's saying is that
[00:11:57] even nepalese or is it just an act
[00:11:59] right to make it seem like he's
[00:12:01] processing so fast all right let's fast
[00:12:03] forward to where he recalls it here
[00:12:08] okay so here's the other word flag is
[00:12:10] he's recalling something
[00:12:11] this is supposed to be a one take thing
[00:12:13] but like i have no idea what he's doing
[00:12:15] over there
[00:12:16] for someone to do something so
[00:12:18] incredible if you really could do it
[00:12:20] then you would want to make sure that
[00:12:22] your video
[00:12:23] captured every possible question that
[00:12:26] anybody could have to doubt you
[00:12:28] right and i have a million doubts so
[00:12:31] i think with a lot of these things and
[00:12:33] i've seen a lot of hokey things
[00:12:35] with memory people claiming things that
[00:12:37] are a sham
[00:12:39] if it's too good to be true most likely
[00:12:42] is
[00:12:42] and for all the years of memory
[00:12:45] championships that have existed for
[00:12:46] people who have worked their tail off
[00:12:48] and for the people who are even
[00:12:50] in way better than i am who are the top
[00:12:53] the world champions
[00:12:55] they can't even do anything close to
[00:12:57] this and that's
[00:12:59] the best right so who is this guy i've
[00:13:01] never heard of him before
[00:13:02] this is just recently no this is absurd
[00:13:05] i give this a
[00:13:07] thumbs down on the nelson oh meter this
[00:13:09] is fake i'll tell you that right now
[00:13:11] my gut everything tells me it's fake i
[00:13:14] don't know enough about mentalism or
[00:13:16] people who you know it's a very common
[00:13:19] mentalist
[00:13:19] act to memorize a book but it's a
[00:13:22] magician kind of mentalist
[00:13:24] act and there's different techniques on
[00:13:25] how to do that i don't know too much
[00:13:26] about it but
[00:13:28] i think for example you have books that
[00:13:31] have all the same pages you memorize one
[00:13:33] page and then
[00:13:34] it doesn't matter what page you get i
[00:13:35] don't know if that's happening here
[00:13:37] another thing you could do is have
[00:13:38] something in your ear
[00:13:39] i see his ear right here it doesn't look
[00:13:41] like it what do i know
[00:13:43] from what i understand a lot of those
[00:13:44] ear pieces you can get them
[00:13:46] really tiny really deep in your ear they
[00:13:48] have to be fished out even
[00:13:50] so who knows someone has this book and
[00:13:52] the information in it
[00:13:53] and um is just relaying the information
[00:13:56] to him as he writes it out
[00:13:58] that would be a very easy thing to fake
[00:13:59] he may even have
[00:14:01] another iphone with pictures of every
[00:14:03] single page
[00:14:05] you know who knows i couldn't see what
[00:14:06] he was doing there he was hunched over
[00:14:08] in the distance
[00:14:12] hey the guys the guys the showmen
[00:14:17] he's asking the host for some water for
[00:14:20] his fingertips so he can turn the pages
[00:14:21] faster
[00:14:23] if there's anything honestly that i've
[00:14:25] been impressed with it's how fast he can
[00:14:27] turn the pages
[00:14:29] i need some more water
[00:14:36] concentration of that voice to make sure
[00:14:38] that people know that you're memorizing
[00:14:40] harder all right i've had enough of that
[00:14:42] guy um
[00:14:43] but i will say this the jaya vajayi
[00:14:46] let's call him bj
[00:14:47] bj i invite you to my channel let's do
[00:14:50] an interview
[00:14:51] me and you nobody else and i'll come up
[00:14:55] with some memory tests
[00:14:57] that probably will pale in comparison to
[00:14:59] this this looks really hard so whatever
[00:15:00] i quiz you on will probably
[00:15:02] be easy for you but i would love to have
[00:15:04] you on my channel
[00:15:05] prove me wrong i love to be proven wrong
[00:15:08] okay i would love for this to be true in
[00:15:11] which
[00:15:12] case i think i'm out of a job but
[00:15:15] come show the world i have a lot of
[00:15:17] viewers who would love
[00:15:18] to see you do your thing quizzed by a
[00:15:21] memory expert
[00:15:22] let's move on
[00:15:26] i love this this is this is one of my
[00:15:28] favorite i've seen this this is one of
[00:15:29] my favorite videos
[00:15:31] so let's see so she shuffles
[00:15:35] both hands the crazy thing about him is
[00:15:37] i know that when he does these fumbling
[00:15:41] really muddled shuffles it's actually he
[00:15:44] knows what he's doing it's it's
[00:15:45] it's someone on purpose i think we have
[00:15:47] it now yeah good good but jesus this
[00:15:49] looks really mixed up
[00:15:51] so since he's gathered the card let's
[00:15:52] see so now
[00:15:56] so he's doing something here well maybe
[00:15:59] he's flipping the cards but i think he's
[00:16:00] also
[00:16:01] probably memorizing or even
[00:16:05] ordering cards a certain way out
[00:16:08] when i miss some calls but i'll i love
[00:16:10] it so now
[00:16:12] i will do it interesting i didn't do too
[00:16:13] much there from what i could tell
[00:16:16] ace of diamonds yes two of diamonds i'll
[00:16:19] do it quick now
[00:16:21] this is such a weird grip on the card i
[00:16:23] wonder like how he's
[00:16:24] yes and he's four yeah like even if i
[00:16:28] were to do this with actual memory
[00:16:29] techniques
[00:16:30] i'd have to say okay here it is and then
[00:16:32] pull it out but he's just kind of like
[00:16:35] i don't know how he's doing it
[00:16:38] so next card will be was it five
[00:16:41] yeah i will reverse it face up here
[00:16:45] yes okay amazing
[00:16:48] six six with a thumb
[00:16:54] now he's just showing off this is
[00:16:56] awesome seven
[00:17:02] yes i do this i know what it is because
[00:17:04] i picked the four and another
[00:17:07] right
[00:17:10] hey i'm pretty certain he can't see but
[00:17:13] this is um
[00:17:15] and again i can't i honestly don't know
[00:17:17] how much memory is involved here
[00:17:19] um my card magician friends out there
[00:17:22] please
[00:17:22] chime in but i would guess that there's
[00:17:25] not much
[00:17:26] memorization unless it's a stacked deck
[00:17:28] he's pre-memorized it but then
[00:17:30] how did he that shuffle looks really
[00:17:33] messy
[00:17:34] didn't look like it was fake
[00:17:38] yeah jack you're sweating yeah
[00:17:42] jack of
[00:17:45] diamonds correct yes
[00:17:52] queen queen with misdirection
[00:17:57] misdirection that's good man yeah
[00:18:00] [Applause]
[00:18:05] and then king last one came after exact
[00:18:10] five seconds
[00:18:13] yeah five five seconds five one
[00:18:18] two three four
[00:18:22] check it yes
[00:18:26] king of diamonds oh that's awesome
[00:18:31] and actually maybe i should try it
[00:18:35] i'm no magician but i could try the
[00:18:37] memory
[00:18:38] version of it let's give it a go
[00:18:43] all right so i got my blindfold here i
[00:18:45] got some cards
[00:18:50] just to show you it's all mixed up but i
[00:18:53] will shuffle it again
[00:18:56] now what am i going to do i can't do all
[00:18:58] the flourishes and stuff like that i'm
[00:19:00] not going to
[00:19:01] pretend like i'm a magician at all but
[00:19:05] i'll show you it's not too hard to
[00:19:06] actually memorize the deck
[00:19:08] pretty quickly and then
[00:19:11] pull out the cards
[00:19:17] in that ascending order so let's maybe
[00:19:19] do the
[00:19:21] i don't know the diamonds just like he
[00:19:24] did
[00:19:30] i've actually never done this before so
[00:19:32] let's try so
[00:19:33] first things first let me memorize
[00:19:46] okay i think i got that let me uh
[00:19:49] one more time
[00:19:52] okay all right
[00:19:59] okay i'm not as charming but here we go
[00:20:02] we're gonna start with the ace of hearts
[00:20:05] oh shoot i did the hearts
[00:20:07] i said i was gonna do the diamonds my
[00:20:08] bad i'm gonna do the hearts
[00:20:10] um
[00:20:13] i think this is an ace
[00:20:18] yeah i'm gonna put that here
[00:20:25] two hearts
[00:20:26] [Music]
[00:20:29] three hearts four hearts
[00:20:35] okay five of hearts that's an easy one
[00:20:37] it's right here

=== Memorize ALL 50 US States (School of Memory Ep. 1) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0hKV-nASpE

[00:00:05] [Music]
[00:00:08] okay this looks just like a newscaster
[00:00:11] show
[00:00:12] hi my name is nelson dallas and in this
[00:00:14] video we are going to talk about
[00:00:16] how to memorize all the states of the
[00:00:19] united
[00:00:20] all 50 states in the usa their names and
[00:00:23] where they are on the map a super easy
[00:00:25] mnemonic
[00:00:26] that was inspired by a video by someone
[00:00:29] called miss
[00:00:30] alexander a teacher i presume the
[00:00:32] original video is
[00:00:33] linked in the description so check it
[00:00:35] out and give her channel some love as
[00:00:36] well but i figured i could make it a
[00:00:38] little more
[00:00:38] visually appealing and maybe make some
[00:00:40] of the mnemonics a little more
[00:00:42] friendly hello all right let's get
[00:00:44] started
[00:00:46] so we're going to start with the word
[00:00:47] can't c
[00:00:49] a n t now notice that all four of these
[00:00:53] states are at the southern border so
[00:00:56] just remember that you can't
[00:00:57] cross the border into mexico unless you
[00:01:00] got a passport
[00:01:01] you can't c is for california a arizona
[00:01:04] and new mexico and t texas can't now
[00:01:07] right above that you're gonna put the
[00:01:08] word
[00:01:09] nuk like duck but with an n so the n
[00:01:12] goes for nevada u for utah c
[00:01:15] for colorado and k for kansas
[00:01:19] right across there now what you can
[00:01:21] remember is first of all
[00:01:22] nevada is the n has that little v there
[00:01:25] in the corner to help you remember that
[00:01:27] it's nevada
[00:01:29] and then to remember the rest just think
[00:01:30] of a duck kind of walking across these
[00:01:33] four states here
[00:01:34] and to remember that it's knuck not duck
[00:01:37] maybe think of knocking
[00:01:40] right so think of this duck he wants to
[00:01:42] get down through the border but he can't
[00:01:45] but he's knocking on those states to see
[00:01:48] if he can actually cross
[00:01:49] into them and then potentially into
[00:01:52] mexico
[00:01:53] that duck knocking now let's take a
[00:01:55] little detour if you go above the letter
[00:01:57] k
[00:01:58] all of these that go down vertically
[00:02:00] into that k
[00:02:02] have a k in them so at the top here we
[00:02:05] have
[00:02:06] north dakota then south dakota then we
[00:02:09] have nebraska
[00:02:12] then underneath kansas we have oak
[00:02:15] lahoma now i always like to look at
[00:02:17] oklahoma and it looks kind of like
[00:02:20] a meat cleaver and that handle there you
[00:02:23] just remember is made
[00:02:24] of oak if we go west from north dakota
[00:02:27] the top there we have montana now if you
[00:02:30] look at the little edge of montana it
[00:02:32] kind of looks like a little m
[00:02:34] there and it's kind of like mountainy in
[00:02:36] a way you can imagine them to be
[00:02:38] mountains the mountain reminds you of
[00:02:40] montana
[00:02:42] going further west you have idaho which
[00:02:45] looks like a lowercase i then if we keep
[00:02:48] going to the west we're going to
[00:02:49] eventually hit the water and you want to
[00:02:51] say whoa
[00:02:53] i don't want to hit the water got to be
[00:02:54] careful otherwise i'm going to go in the
[00:02:56] ocean so
[00:02:56] whoa w-o that's washington and oregon
[00:03:00] now we miss one why why did we miss old
[00:03:03] wyoming
[00:03:04] y will remind you of wyoming now we're
[00:03:07] going to go down the midwest here and i
[00:03:08] want you to remember the word mimo
[00:03:10] kind of strange but imagine there is a
[00:03:12] chef
[00:03:14] and his name is mr mimo
[00:03:18] and you'll see here that you actually
[00:03:19] have the shape of
[00:03:21] a chef he's got a chef hat there's his
[00:03:24] face
[00:03:25] you've got his body his pants and then
[00:03:27] the boots
[00:03:28] now the chef he just happens to love
[00:03:30] mice you can actually kind of see a
[00:03:32] little mouse
[00:03:33] face here on the little point of
[00:03:35] minnesota at the top
[00:03:36] so minnie mouse minnesota now iowa
[00:03:39] is where his face is it should make
[00:03:41] sense because that's where his eye
[00:03:43] would go iowa now the m in the middle
[00:03:46] here is missouri
[00:03:48] and that's where his heart is right and
[00:03:50] if he's ever attacked you want to make
[00:03:52] sure that
[00:03:53] you miss that part of his body because
[00:03:56] otherwise he'd be in trouble so that's
[00:03:58] the part you want to miss
[00:04:00] miss suri now if we go down a little
[00:04:02] further we have
[00:04:03] arkansas you can remember that because
[00:04:05] it's kind of near kansas it's r
[00:04:07] kansas and then finally his boot is
[00:04:10] louisiana
[00:04:11] you can remember that l-state name
[00:04:13] because of the shape of the boot is an l
[00:04:15] now if we go out from his missouri chest
[00:04:18] area
[00:04:19] you'll notice that there's kind of this
[00:04:21] straight little square there
[00:04:22] that's tennessee and above that is this
[00:04:25] kind of little jumble of stuff and
[00:04:26] that's kentucky
[00:04:28] now he's a chef after all so you can
[00:04:30] imagine him holding
[00:04:31] 10 plates out in front of him and on top
[00:04:33] of them are some kentucky fried chicken
[00:04:35] legs
[00:04:36] right so we have mr mimel the chef
[00:04:38] holding out 10 plates
[00:04:40] 10 the sea and above it on top of the
[00:04:42] plates
[00:04:44] are kentucky fried chicken legs kentucky
[00:04:46] so that's
[00:04:47] k and t now in that area just
[00:04:50] above kentucky we have a few states
[00:04:52] there and they're all
[00:04:53] near the great lakes so you can imagine
[00:04:56] that area is kind of wet
[00:04:57] right so i want you to remember the word
[00:04:59] y
[00:05:01] mop and what that will be is wisconsin
[00:05:05] illinois indiana michigan ohio and
[00:05:08] pennsylvania
[00:05:09] now one thing to help you remember which
[00:05:11] eye is which
[00:05:12] it's going to be illinois as the first
[00:05:15] eye
[00:05:16] and then indiana as the second one the
[00:05:18] way you can remember that
[00:05:19] is illinois if you look at it it kind of
[00:05:21] looks like someone's coughing
[00:05:23] so illinois the person is ill and it has
[00:05:26] a little bump
[00:05:27] kind of the back of the guy's head which
[00:05:29] is poking in
[00:05:30] to indiana all right next up we go to
[00:05:33] the top right corner we're going to
[00:05:34] start up
[00:05:35] at main think of it as the main point of
[00:05:37] the map right it's the top right
[00:05:38] pretty prominent it's the main part of
[00:05:40] the map m
[00:05:42] now going down here we have a backwards
[00:05:44] h
[00:05:45] that's new hampshire then we have a
[00:05:47] state next to that that looks kind of
[00:05:48] like a v
[00:05:49] that's vermont and right below that we
[00:05:51] have this massive
[00:05:53] hook shaped thing because it's catching
[00:05:54] a bunch of fish off the coast
[00:05:56] and that is massachusetts then right
[00:05:58] below that we have some
[00:06:00] very small state and islands are pretty
[00:06:02] small right so
[00:06:03] this is rhode island now if you go to
[00:06:06] the left a bit you'll see that that
[00:06:07] state is new york it kind of has a y
[00:06:10] there so that will help you remember
[00:06:11] that it's new york
[00:06:13] and in between rhode island and new york
[00:06:14] you have this other state there which
[00:06:16] connects
[00:06:17] them together which is connecticut going
[00:06:20] down a bit we have a state that has
[00:06:22] kind of the shape of a j that's new
[00:06:24] jersey
[00:06:25] now delaware just below that i like to
[00:06:27] think it actually looks kind of like a d
[00:06:29] next to delaware you have this almost m
[00:06:32] shaped state
[00:06:33] there with a little outcrop there now
[00:06:35] the m should remind you of maryland and
[00:06:37] people there are very merry
[00:06:40] down below that we have an upside down v
[00:06:43] for virginia
[00:06:44] to the west of that obviously we have
[00:06:46] west virginia
[00:06:48] now below that i like to think that
[00:06:49] those two states there below virginia
[00:06:52] kind of make a c together and those are
[00:06:54] the carolinas
[00:06:55] north carolina and south carolina now
[00:06:58] these three states right below that area
[00:07:01] are m-a-g now to me they all look like
[00:07:04] faces of simpson characters and i like
[00:07:07] to think of maggie simpson
[00:07:09] she's one of the simpsons the little
[00:07:10] baby so that helps me remember
[00:07:12] m-a-g that's mississippi alabama and
[00:07:15] georgia and then finally below that
[00:07:17] we have a backwards f for florida
[00:07:21] then of course we have our two states
[00:07:23] that are
[00:07:24] not in the continental u.s we have
[00:07:26] alaska and hawaii
[00:07:28] now the alaska is easy because it kind
[00:07:30] of looks like an a
[00:07:31] a lowercase a and then finally for
[00:07:33] hawaii it's so far out there in the
[00:07:35] pacific
[00:07:36] that when you go there you say hi hawaii
[00:07:39] hawaii
[00:07:40] yeah there you have it all 50 states
[00:07:43] quick mnemonic if you follow that little
[00:07:44] crazy little story you'll have them in
[00:07:46] no time you could fill in this map
[00:07:48] lickety-split it could be split yeah all
[00:07:51] right that's it
[00:07:52] all 50 states in your noggin now if you
[00:07:54] like that stuff and you like this kind
[00:07:55] of content that helps you remember more

=== I used ANIMAL CROSSING to MEMORIZE stuff! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdOnjVP49FU

[00:00:00] today I'm gonna do something that I
[00:00:01] really never thought I would do and that
[00:00:03] is record myself playing video games now
[00:00:09] everybody's been talking about this game
[00:00:11] called Animal Crossing yes
[00:00:14] Animal Crossing I've never played it my
[00:00:16] brother's obsessed with it I pull all
[00:00:18] the games but I've never played Animal
[00:00:20] Crossing might the only loser out there
[00:00:23] that hasn't played this game and I still
[00:00:26] have not played this game I'm gonna be
[00:00:27] playing it for the very first time today
[00:00:30] catch up on what everybody seems to be
[00:00:32] talking about from what I understand I
[00:00:34] don't really understand what you do with
[00:00:36] this game I think I do work I don't know
[00:00:38] you build your own houses and Island and
[00:00:42] pimp it out and then visit other people
[00:00:46] I
[00:00:48] yeah that's the extent that I know but
[00:00:51] what I do know is that it sounds a lot
[00:00:53] like something that I could definitely
[00:00:55] use to memorize something and that's
[00:00:57] what we're gonna do today in this video
[00:00:59] we are going to use Animal Crossing
[00:01:01] because the houses or the islands that I
[00:01:03] built to memorize some stuff what are we
[00:01:06] gonna memorize I actually don't know yet
[00:01:08] probably something fairly easy and fun
[00:01:11] but I guess the first thing we got to do
[00:01:13] is open the game up and get started I
[00:01:17] literally have never played this game
[00:01:19] I'm opening it for the very first time
[00:01:22] here that flows Yoshi let's play that
[00:01:24] before what should I name myself as I
[00:01:38] always do else
[00:01:46] birthday
[00:01:48] you guys know loops - for this it is
[00:01:54] ionic my own character here okay then we
[00:01:57] can fast-forward through this part okay
[00:02:05] alright so they gave me attempt I guess
[00:02:09] [Music]
[00:02:10] just forgot some simple living to start
[00:02:14] early I gotta find a place to put it but
[00:02:17] here yes so the plan is is to memorize
[00:02:31] all right cool can I go my thumbs
[00:02:34] I guess one eternity later so I figured
[00:02:42] in this very bare area we could memorize
[00:02:45] our first list okay let's start with the
[00:02:48] world's top 10 largest oceans and shits
[00:02:53] largest oceans and the Seas okay cool
[00:02:57] so memory palaces you can make anywhere
[00:03:02] usually I make videos on how to take
[00:03:04] real-life places that you know in your
[00:03:06] head and use them as memory palaces but
[00:03:08] you could easily use any video game I'm
[00:03:11] going to use this beautiful cute game
[00:03:13] let's start simple let's start with ten
[00:03:16] locations one for each of these oceans
[00:03:19] know what let's make this tent the first
[00:03:21] one this box here the second
[00:03:28] this rock out here the third four could
[00:03:32] be this shell five could be could be
[00:03:37] just a beach six could be these flowers
[00:03:41] here seven could be that beetle eight
[00:03:45] could be this tree with the apples
[00:03:49] I don't know nine could be this stick
[00:03:52] and then ten could be this open slot
[00:03:54] here nothing to very memorable I
[00:03:57] probably wouldn't do this normally but
[00:03:58] since we're just getting started
[00:04:00] that's what we'll do all right so we
[00:04:02] start with Pacific Ocean so on this 10th
[00:04:06] I would picture a large pacifier just
[00:04:09] sucking on the top of that tent okay
[00:04:13] then we have here in this post box the
[00:04:15] Atlantic Ocean so I would maybe a
[00:04:17] imagine a Trident coming out of the top
[00:04:22] of because I think of like Atlantis
[00:04:25] Atlantic voila
[00:04:27] alright then we go over here to this
[00:04:30] rock here the third one is Indian Ocean
[00:04:33] so I'm just gonna imagine a big bowl of
[00:04:37] Indian curry pour all over this rock 4
[00:04:41] is this shell here we have the Arctic
[00:04:44] Ocean - imagine touching this thing and
[00:04:47] it's ice cold to the touch
[00:04:50] Arctic Ocean okay then we go down here I
[00:04:54] said this little beach area was gonna be
[00:04:57] the next which is the Coral Sea so just
[00:04:59] imagine that there's some coral that
[00:05:01] gets washed up here easy okay then we
[00:05:05] come up here the flowers 6 is the
[00:05:07] Arabian Sea I'm just going to imagine
[00:05:10] like an Arabian horse just kind of
[00:05:12] galloping round around on top of these
[00:05:14] flowers trampling them alright 7 is this
[00:05:18] tree here with the apples we're gonna do
[00:05:21] the South China Sea so I might maybe
[00:05:23] think about 3 apples there but beneath
[00:05:27] it South is gonna be some chopsticks and
[00:05:32] maybe I use the chopsticks to get the
[00:05:33] apples right okay three more eight
[00:05:44] shoot I forgot what I was going to use
[00:05:46] was it whatever I'll make it up now it
[00:05:49] will be this tree here which is the
[00:05:51] Caribbean Sea so I'm gonna imagine some
[00:05:53] pirates kind of on the Caribbean Sea
[00:05:57] going around this tree 9 will be this
[00:06:00] stick which is the Mediterranean so
[00:06:02] maybe I'll imagine picking up the stick
[00:06:04] to meditate it makes me so peaceful and
[00:06:08] then finally this open clearing here
[00:06:10] will be the Bering Sea that's the tenth
[00:06:12] largest body of water bearing I'm just
[00:06:15] going to think of a big bear sitting
[00:06:17] there cool I'm not gonna look let's go
[00:06:21] back to our tent it's either to remember
[00:06:23] those 10 items we have the pacifier
[00:06:27] Pacific we have the Trident Atlantic we
[00:06:31] have Indian we had Arctic we have the
[00:06:39] Coral Sea give the Arabian Sea and hit
[00:06:43] the South China Sea we have the
[00:06:47] Caribbean Sea we had the Mediterranean
[00:06:51] Sea and we have the Bering Sea awesome
[00:06:54] so I had to name my island
[00:06:58] alright so we're having some festivities
[00:07:01] here celebrating that I've named my
[00:07:03] island else land eeeh the best name ever
[00:07:07] this campsite is pretty awesome so why
[00:07:09] don't we use that as our next place to
[00:07:11] memorize something and in terms of a
[00:07:14] list maybe we could do something like
[00:07:19] happiest animals
[00:07:24] sure top 10 have these animals alright
[00:07:28] well first we need 10 locations let's
[00:07:32] start here
[00:07:33] well actually this sort of the fire
[00:07:35] location number one then two can be this
[00:07:38] little wine dude with a tambourine three
[00:07:42] could be this stump with the saw on it
[00:07:45] for could be the Sheep table 5 could be
[00:07:50] these boxes 6 could be a little dude
[00:07:54] with the flag 7 could be dad with the
[00:07:58] alcoholic bed hate to be this boom box 9
[00:08:03] could be this tent and then finally 10
[00:08:07] could be the megaphone over here pretty
[00:08:10] solid ok first one is a blue whale so
[00:08:14] imagine on the fire there is a massive
[00:08:17] blue whale just being roasted alive ok
[00:08:21] starting dark here alright next dude
[00:08:24] here my man is a whale shark so I'm
[00:08:27] gonna imagine a whale and a shark on his
[00:08:30] tambourine just being smashed together a
[00:08:32] whale and a shark all right here on the
[00:08:34] stump we have an African elephant so
[00:08:38] elephants easy a picture they've got
[00:08:40] stuff kind of legs but he's African okay
[00:08:44] so I just imagine him you know coming
[00:08:47] from Island of Africa now look at
[00:08:50] continental Island hmm ok next we have
[00:08:53] the Indian elephant ok another elephant
[00:08:56] is here smashing this chick here and
[00:08:59] [Music]
[00:09:00] again we got that curry theme going on
[00:09:03] maybe this Indian elephant is eating
[00:09:05] some curry while he stomps on earth get
[00:09:09] mess we have the white rhinoceros so I'm
[00:09:12] just gonna imagine a white rhinoceros
[00:09:14] ramming into this thing with its horn
[00:09:16] and it's white like painted white
[00:09:18] alright my man here with the little flag
[00:09:20] it's a hippopotamus so maybe this little
[00:09:23] flag he waves there's a little Potamus
[00:09:26] attached
[00:09:26] to it this guy with a drink is a giraffe
[00:09:31] so imagine the little straw he has in
[00:09:34] there is actually a giraffe neck poking
[00:09:37] out of there alright this guy here we
[00:09:42] have done we have and I can keep my my
[00:09:49] memory palaces straight we had one two
[00:09:51] three four five six seven
[00:09:56] [Music]
[00:10:00] yeah okay no we skip here eight is the
[00:10:04] boomboxes crocodile so let's imagine
[00:10:07] this crocodile is just kind of like
[00:10:09] chomping on this boom box okay then nine
[00:10:14] can be this tent over here which is the
[00:10:17] Asian war gar yeah but it makes me think
[00:10:23] of like cuacamole and it's Asian so
[00:10:26] maybe it's got like a kind of soy taste
[00:10:29] to it and it's the color of guacamole so
[00:10:32] maybe it's covered in spicy Asian wakka
[00:10:35] moly who are Asian flora whatever boys
[00:10:37] yeah and finally the speakerphone here
[00:10:43] we have a bison okay so I'm gonna Majan
[00:10:49] maybe we'll take this literally on the
[00:10:51] megaphone somebody saying bye son
[00:10:53] I'm saying bye to their son alright
[00:10:56] let's see we remember that we had the
[00:10:59] blue whale whale shark African elephant
[00:11:05] Indian elephant white rhino what do we
[00:11:10] have here the hippopotamus giraffe
[00:11:14] crocodile attempt the Asian war and then
[00:11:20] finally the Bison do they do alright so
[00:11:26] this seems like I need a house and I
[00:11:29] think I have to the guys started guy
[00:11:34] from the island started asking me for
[00:11:36] money so I think I have to find a way to
[00:11:37] make money which is probably like
[00:11:40] picking up stuff and selling it I don't
[00:11:46] know I need a house go inside yeah okay
[00:11:51] oh snap this tent is cool this thing
[00:11:57] could be a memory palace let's do
[00:11:59] another memory house yeah maybe we could
[00:12:01] do one of the world's smallest countries
[00:12:04] that's kind of cool oh yeah all right
[00:12:07] cool
[00:12:07] top ten all right so we need ten
[00:12:09] locations this place is great maybe
[00:12:12] where I'm standing right now could be
[00:12:13] the first that's where you walk in
[00:12:15] that's the first location then maybe
[00:12:17] here this little chest here could be the
[00:12:18] second the third could be a little dude
[00:12:22] here for could be the guy here with the
[00:12:24] book five could be the clock in the back
[00:12:27] there
[00:12:27] six could be this little tea pot seven
[00:12:31] could be my main man here H could be
[00:12:34] this maybe the blue bottles nine could
[00:12:40] be this cutting board area Center the
[00:12:43] desk and then ten could be this hose
[00:12:47] here or corner whatever okay notice that
[00:12:52] when I make a memory calls I usually go
[00:12:53] in some kind of clockwise or
[00:12:55] anti-clockwise fashion just so it's easy
[00:12:58] to know all right first one is Vatican
[00:13:02] City all right so where I'm standing is
[00:13:04] the Vatican City what do I think with
[00:13:06] Vatican I think of like a bat in a can
[00:13:10] super literal sounds like that so I'm
[00:13:13] gonna imagine a bat like a flying bat
[00:13:15] animal inside of a can bat can alright
[00:13:19] then over here next one is Monaco so I
[00:13:24] think of the Monaco draw free so I'm
[00:13:25] gonna Majan the Formula One car zooming
[00:13:29] around the top of this thing and then
[00:13:34] this little guy here next one is
[00:13:36] Gibraltar sounds kind of like a Jeep and
[00:13:38] an alter Jeep alter Gibraltar so I'm
[00:13:41] gonna think of like a cheap getting
[00:13:44] married to another Jeep at the altar
[00:13:46] maybe he's the actual officiating person
[00:13:49] for this wedding so he's marrying a Jeep
[00:13:51] at the altar alright next guy bringing
[00:13:54] the book is Macau I'm just gonna think
[00:13:57] he's reading about a book about his cow
[00:13:59] my cow
[00:14:00] how about how Macau alright then the
[00:14:03] clock in the background is number five
[00:14:05] it's a knell room that's only in the
[00:14:08] Pacific
[00:14:08] nor it nor ooh so maybe I think I look
[00:14:11] at the clock and I say it's now aura
[00:14:16] no or something with now an hour it's
[00:14:20] now er
[00:14:21] Nora whatever you get the idea it's
[00:14:24] close
[00:14:25] alright then the teapot here is gonna be
[00:14:27] to follow so I'm gonna think of maybe
[00:14:32] two of those cups falling falling too
[00:14:36] long to fall to fall too volatile then
[00:14:40] this guy
[00:14:41] we have Bermuda that's easy kind of
[00:14:44] looks like he's wearing a Bermuda shirt
[00:14:46] maybe I can look at the little triangle
[00:14:48] around his chest and v-neck there that's
[00:14:50] the Bermuda Triangle
[00:14:52] I hear at the desk we have the glue
[00:14:55] bottles and that is San Marino which
[00:14:58] reminds me of denry no Dan Marino should
[00:15:01] die of gonorrhea and rot in hell would
[00:15:05] you like a cookie spinner so maybe he's
[00:15:07] using those blue sticks picks him up and
[00:15:09] throws him like a football on this board
[00:15:11] we have a Lichtenstein which makes me
[00:15:13] think of like licking a sign like the
[00:15:21] German drink just licking it that's on
[00:15:25] top of there and then finally the last
[00:15:27] one here we have Antigua just gonna
[00:15:30] picture an ant's kind of crawling around
[00:15:31] this thing so what do we have in the
[00:15:34] first one we have the bat in the campus
[00:15:36] of Vatican City on here we have the
[00:15:38] formula one that was Monaco then this
[00:15:41] little dude here he was marrying a jeep
[00:15:44] at the altar Gibraltar then here we had
[00:15:47] was got a reading about his cow a cow
[00:15:49] then we had the clock tower then we had
[00:15:53] two cups two volume for me to triangle
[00:15:57] Bernina this guy then we had San Marino
[00:16:00] throwing the glue on the cutting board
[00:16:03] we have Lichtenstein and I finally had
[00:16:05] Antigua awesome
[00:16:08] memory causes don't have to actually be
[00:16:10] places you can use any game that you
[00:16:12] play or some world or place or area that
[00:16:15] you know very well real or not
[00:16:18] you can see it's just as effective and
[00:16:20] it's actually a lot of fun like share

=== The Mentalists // 2007 World Memory Championships (Full Documentary) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNSMSVy6iiw

[00:00:31] swatting away in and that
[00:00:32] which is flying into the cable channel 5
[00:00:35] Street Fighter 2 the statue on which is
[00:00:38] sitting at Kessler there's a small group
[00:00:40] of people across the world whose brains
[00:00:42] Harbor an extraordinary ability payors
[00:00:45] and by noise they're called
[00:00:50] lemon ists and they're able to remember
[00:00:52] thousands of random numbers binary
[00:00:54] digits and playing cards in a single
[00:00:56] viewing as mental athletes there's is a
[00:01:01] world of intense competition and
[00:01:04] continual training using the unique
[00:01:09] mental techniques they not only push
[00:01:11] their own boundaries but those of the
[00:01:13] human brain incidentally the 7 of
[00:01:17] diamonds Isis pairs full of art slaves
[00:01:19] bag to cook islands body clubs but
[00:01:22] ultimately their main aim is to make it
[00:01:25] to the Middle Eastern Kingdom of Bahrain
[00:01:26] and become the next memory champion of
[00:01:30] the world
[00:01:32] [Music]
[00:01:50] I just memorized 234 digit number using
[00:01:55] the journey that goes around this house
[00:01:56] in the garden okay
[00:01:59] in here we have a soldier watching a war
[00:02:02] movie from which a leg is flying out
[00:02:04] through the world there which is landing
[00:02:06] on a gammon chop where there's a balloon
[00:02:09] attached to a toga and in the pocket of
[00:02:12] the Togo a knife it's been taken by
[00:02:15] someone from out in the hall there were
[00:02:17] a thousand different possible
[00:02:18] combinations of three digits I've got an
[00:02:20] image for each each one of those
[00:02:22] pre-programmed in my head so to speak
[00:02:25] 104 104 is a ballet performance 72 a
[00:02:31] cane welshman to unknown and mr. Behm
[00:02:37] was he called mr. Mac iPhone poet three
[00:02:41] days Miha the lavabit Carson rabbit
[00:02:44] we all have hidden talents for been
[00:02:47] pretty more it's an extraordinary memory
[00:02:49] just a second I forgot only been uses a
[00:02:52] technique that allows you to memorize
[00:02:54] thousands of random numbers a chimney a
[00:02:59] lurker have man lurking in the shadows
[00:03:02] numbers become images that are placed at
[00:03:04] set points along a route Ben then turns
[00:03:07] those images into a story he can
[00:03:08] remember where there's a a camel being
[00:03:12] eaten by a flubber with a street sign
[00:03:15] and a pair of scissors from which
[00:03:17] someone is flashing their bum well it
[00:03:20] was more of a gradual process I dreamed
[00:03:22] up the list over the course of M 3 days
[00:03:25] and drilled it into my head when I
[00:03:27] wasn't doing anything but then it was a
[00:03:28] case of him going through the list
[00:03:30] constantly in my head on my way to and
[00:03:32] from work every morning until I got so I
[00:03:34] could reel it off and the from pulp
[00:03:37] fiction who's talking over here on the
[00:03:40] driveway to Jamie Theakston waving a
[00:03:43] Sukkah dart in a a gale fierce wind
[00:03:46] which is blowing out to the frontier
[00:03:49] sushi at a set of bongos being played by
[00:03:52] a rabbit and in the back garden we have
[00:03:55] zygote the mutant brandishing a cane at
[00:03:57] another baboon and that's me 234 digits
[00:04:01] [Music]
[00:04:04] this is the place I could walk so that's
[00:04:07] where my journeys Minh visualizations
[00:04:09] look like but ground up somewhere else
[00:04:12] they'd look like that 30 year old Ben is
[00:04:17] about to embark upon his most important
[00:04:19] journey yet it's one that could take him
[00:04:23] halfway around the globe and potentially
[00:04:25] crown him memory champion of the world
[00:04:28] [Music]
[00:04:30] it starts in Shropshire all that it
[00:04:36] leaves for me now is to to wish you the
[00:04:38] best of fortune in the use of your
[00:04:41] brains during this day and to look
[00:04:44] forward to congratulating the first UK
[00:04:47] memory champion
[00:04:48] thank you may the games begin 10 seconds
[00:04:53] the world championships takes place in
[00:04:56] Bahrain that's where the Giants of
[00:04:59] memory the Titans clash and the UK
[00:05:02] champion will be there battling for the
[00:05:06] world crown go the the mind sport of
[00:05:09] memory is the new kid on the block so
[00:05:12] it's a it's exploding over the next
[00:05:17] eight hours Ben and the other
[00:05:19] competitors will undergo 10 separate
[00:05:21] memory disciplines their challenge will
[00:05:24] be to recall hundreds of historical
[00:05:26] dates and random words and the sequences
[00:05:28] of thousands of numbers and binary
[00:05:30] digits as well as the order of up to 15
[00:05:34] decks of playing cards
[00:05:35] [Music]
[00:05:39] Ben's just memorized a hundred numbers
[00:05:41] in a hundred seconds by creating one of
[00:05:44] his unique visual stories well it's it
[00:05:47] started with a em plane dropping off the
[00:05:49] suitcase which then in turn opened up
[00:05:54] and revealed a loofa which was shot down
[00:05:56] by a laser controlled by a giant snake
[00:05:58] monster thing which was getting on board
[00:06:00] the train sending an airplane an
[00:06:02] identical one to the first one 61 again
[00:06:04] to vary but in a betting shop next to a
[00:06:09] temple and then what came after that is
[00:06:12] the one I'm completely blank on and
[00:06:13] that's the story that creates those
[00:06:15] hundred digits it makes sense in my head
[00:06:17] at least the final event is the speed
[00:06:26] cards competitors have to correctly
[00:06:31] memorize the order of a shuffled deck of
[00:06:33] cards as quickly as possible no one in
[00:06:38] the world has ever broken the
[00:06:39] thirty-second barrier
[00:06:40] [Music]
[00:06:47] competitors are then given just five
[00:06:49] minutes to duplicate the deck of cards
[00:06:51] they've just memorized I just memorized
[00:07:11] a pack of cards in twenty six point two
[00:07:14] eight seconds which is a new world
[00:07:16] record
[00:07:17] knocking nearly five seconds of the
[00:07:18] previous best which I'm quite delighted
[00:07:21] with I thought this kinda time in
[00:07:23] practice but not complies to it in
[00:07:24] competitions because it's the lucky
[00:07:27] t-shirt always doing well in a
[00:07:28] competition with the zum-zum t-shirt I
[00:07:30] saved it for the special occasions if I
[00:07:34] had my word well it's sort of all three
[00:07:35] days of the world championships pretend
[00:07:36] to sweat a lot when I get nervous and
[00:07:38] I'm filling in so it'd be pretty
[00:07:39] unpleasant by the end so I go for my
[00:07:41] second look Eastern third luckiest yes
[00:07:43] safely spring for the final days of over
[00:07:45] Oh No
[00:07:59] the UK has its new memory champion and
[00:08:03] Ben is now set to take on the rest of
[00:08:06] the world man's first disobedience and
[00:08:16] the fruit of that forbidden tree whose
[00:08:19] mortal taste for death under the world
[00:08:22] and all our singing o heavenly news that
[00:08:27] on the sea I've got a a project on the
[00:08:33] go which is I'm trending on the whole of
[00:08:34] Paradise Lost which is twelve thousand
[00:08:37] were eating that lion poem what I know
[00:08:40] so far takes me about seven hours to
[00:08:42] recite so the end it would take like 28
[00:08:44] hours ed cook is currently ranked the
[00:08:49] 17th best memorizer in the world so I
[00:08:51] begin sorry like here and I Chuck a few
[00:08:54] images basically under the shade of this
[00:08:56] tree like most competitors Edie uses a
[00:09:00] visualization technique to turn
[00:09:02] information into images images then
[00:09:04] become stories that play out around the
[00:09:06] grounds of Ed's home for him it's a love
[00:09:10] of nature that inspires his favorite
[00:09:13] roots it's quite soggy terrain I think
[00:09:16] I'm not absolutely sure about this but
[00:09:18] my intuition is that the quality of the
[00:09:21] terrain has Qwest strongly influence on
[00:09:22] how quickly you can traverse it in your
[00:09:24] imagination it's interesting because one
[00:09:27] of my trees appears to have died I love
[00:09:32] the trees basically when you're
[00:09:35] associating images to trees you need to
[00:09:38] make sure the trees are very different
[00:09:40] from each other in your imagination so
[00:09:42] that when four inserts under this tree I
[00:09:44] have you know whatever will be Tiger
[00:09:46] Woods
[00:09:47] throwing lemons at a giraffe or
[00:09:49] something it's very obviously this tree
[00:09:52] and not that one or that one
[00:09:53] or any of the 60 or so all the trees I
[00:09:55] use
[00:09:57] Reigate so my pile up here having
[00:10:03] recently graduated with the first class
[00:10:05] psychology degree twenty-five-year-old
[00:10:07] Ed's lives at the family home with his
[00:10:09] two younger sisters
[00:10:11] I'll see ya number 82 because you were
[00:10:14] born in 1980 okay Vivi's 87
[00:10:17] good boy Nathan that's 26 for no reason
[00:10:21] at all so the part of my image for
[00:10:23] cavalry division is Mountain precept my
[00:10:24] mom's a few 26 as was kind of downtown
[00:10:26] mum my my mother disapproves it's just a
[00:10:32] waste of my time I always show things
[00:10:33] just weird
[00:10:34] she's always up seconds I was concealed
[00:10:35] was asked me to take the rice out of the
[00:10:37] oven and I forget she was like I told
[00:10:40] you it's not it's not practical my
[00:10:43] sisters
[00:10:44] I think they think it's vaguely funny
[00:10:46] but not impressed
[00:10:48] my dad sort of remains stolidly nude for
[00:10:51] all the saudi I think since I think
[00:10:52] everyone thinks is bit stupid in my
[00:10:53] family well a these PD for a few years
[00:11:02] now and she is a very good laugh but we
[00:11:08] thought he Morris got to the end of his
[00:11:10] life with world memory and he might get
[00:11:13] a job or something but he's still
[00:11:16] ticking around the edges and then we'll
[00:11:19] move on to the to the gate the sort of
[00:11:21] memory tricks he does for world memory
[00:11:23] it's hard to translate into how they
[00:11:27] could be useful true suddenly actually
[00:11:29] carrying on their daily life in terms of
[00:11:31] the interactive properties of gates
[00:11:32] gates can do lots with lots of people so
[00:11:34] I've had like Anna Kournikova doing
[00:11:36] various things to this gate I've
[00:11:38] actually arrived I'm under 22 M own
[00:11:39] system I've urged on this skate before
[00:11:42] and if I have earth perched it because I
[00:11:44] am I tend to have myself to edit my
[00:11:46] characters going in this direction into
[00:11:49] the wood I think one thing he could be
[00:11:51] as a barrister will be the sort of thing
[00:11:54] he could do
[00:11:55] we shall see I love the trees I think I
[00:11:59] can see him do well in this burrowing
[00:12:01] one says he's doing it and then maybe
[00:12:04] give it up for a while and do something
[00:12:07] else completely being remembered it's
[00:12:11] just hilariously cool I can't think of
[00:12:13] something I'd more like to be
[00:12:20] [Music]
[00:12:24] [Applause]
[00:12:25] [Music]
[00:12:30] been pretty more lives alone as a
[00:12:32] jobbing accountant in Darby Ben's
[00:12:38] parents separated when he was nine and
[00:12:41] in his free time he likes to keep his
[00:12:43] grandmother up-to-date with his
[00:12:44] achievements yes I was at a memory
[00:12:54] competition last Saturday the UK
[00:12:56] championships I won the competition I
[00:12:59] broke a world record for memorizing a
[00:13:01] pack of cards in 26 seconds I don't
[00:13:06] believe it peddler I want to believe it
[00:13:09] but I can't see how anybody can do it
[00:13:11] when I do if Silas isn't it you must
[00:13:14] give it a good place of honor Ben
[00:13:16] because it's a it's a marvelous thing it
[00:13:18] really is I use the model for this
[00:13:21] leaping figure here yep that's me
[00:13:22] gazelle you know me I think Ben is a bit
[00:13:28] of a loner it can suddenly close the
[00:13:31] door and leave you and you can't get in
[00:13:35] banja when it's under couple of pints
[00:13:37] it's a different tale but Audrey is a
[00:13:41] bit on the cry side and he doesn't brag
[00:13:43] about his some achievements which I find
[00:13:47] very endearing I mean I go downstairs
[00:13:49] and say what do you think my clever dick
[00:13:51] Ben's done up yeah this is a my late
[00:13:55] father who died um just a bit over a
[00:13:57] year ago
[00:13:59] it's hard to believe he's still God he's
[00:14:01] such a major part of my life obviously I
[00:14:04] do miss him a lot still well he was
[00:14:08] always very proud of the memory stuff
[00:14:10] more than anyone I think he's always
[00:14:14] pleased to hear about it
[00:14:15] here I'm sure we'd be delighted by the
[00:14:17] record
[00:14:18] [Music]
[00:14:25] the famous white stick next time Ben
[00:14:29] visits his grandmother it could well be
[00:14:31] the world title he's showing off these
[00:14:37] World Championships will be the biggest
[00:14:39] yet
[00:14:42] they're the brainchild of self-styled
[00:14:44] visionary Tony Buzan hi my name is Tony
[00:14:48] Buzan and I'm here to tell you that
[00:14:51] whatever you dream is possible
[00:14:54] your brain is infinite all you have to
[00:14:59] do to realize it is to become a warrior
[00:15:01] of the mind hi hi right
[00:15:06] [Music]
[00:15:10] some people call me a guru I'm a teacher
[00:15:14] and guru is an Indian word that means
[00:15:17] teacher
[00:15:18] so whatever the word is in the local
[00:15:22] language that means teacher
[00:15:23] that is what I am and author and
[00:15:26] organized through memory competitions
[00:15:29] view calm managed the manager of
[00:15:31] knowledge your sense Tony Buzan created
[00:15:35] the first memory competition some 15
[00:15:37] years ago there's been a rapid increase
[00:15:39] in those eager to find ways of improving
[00:15:41] their brain and what is the manager of
[00:15:45] knowledge the human brain it's a trend
[00:15:50] Tiny's been quick to embrace he endorses
[00:15:53] various merchandise and is a
[00:15:55] best-selling author
[00:15:57] his 92 books on the brain
[00:15:59] have sold seven million copies worldwide
[00:16:04] I personally would like to be remembered
[00:16:06] as an ambassador for the human brain I'd
[00:16:11] also like to be remembered as the one
[00:16:12] who started the memory championships and
[00:16:15] a number of the championships around the
[00:16:17] cognitive skills of the human brain
[00:16:20] finally I'd like to be remembered as a a
[00:16:22] poet and one who loved mankind every one
[00:16:28] of us every one of us is brilliant and
[00:16:33] it's simply a matter of nurturing and
[00:16:35] unleashing that and that's part of the
[00:16:38] function of the world memory
[00:16:39] championships to show everybody in the
[00:16:41] world just how amazing your brain is
[00:16:50] tony buzan's PR department are keen that
[00:16:53] Ben's new world record makes waves
[00:16:56] beyond just the memory community well
[00:16:59] everyone's been saying lately we need to
[00:17:00] do something to raise the profile of
[00:17:02] memory competitions in Britain I mean
[00:17:06] it's not the kind of thing you're going
[00:17:07] to get into unless you've basically
[00:17:08] stumble across it like I did and so now
[00:17:12] I just got this whirlwind of publicity
[00:17:13] in the East Midlands plus I'm been fed
[00:17:17] more plus I'm bent Widmer and I've just
[00:17:25] been crowned Britain's memory champion
[00:17:27] see me in action live on Central tonight
[00:17:30] having these chopping and change Ron
[00:17:33] thank you I'm Dave our POW nurse TG
[00:17:36] memorizer I turn each pair of cards into
[00:17:38] a mental image of an object to a person
[00:17:40] and visualize them at different points
[00:17:42] along a journey in this case around the
[00:17:43] rooms of my grandma's old house in totin
[00:17:54] for somebody strangely cheerful mode
[00:17:57] after that maybe tomorrow I'll go
[00:18:00] walking around the town and people will
[00:18:01] say that setting off the tally is
[00:18:06] Ben's going to have about 30 seconds to
[00:18:09] memorize and then we'll go through and
[00:18:10] think okay before we do that let's see
[00:18:12] Natyam got on when they had to remember
[00:18:14] just six cards by Prince Ben jr. which
[00:18:21] were on the street it's a bit useless
[00:18:23] don't know what kind of it's totally
[00:18:27] useless not to be able to meander six
[00:18:29] cards when someone waves them in front
[00:18:30] of your face in fact useless is what
[00:18:35] would describe what I do
[00:18:44] incidentally it was seven of diamonds I
[00:18:46] suppose four of Hearts 3 of spades Jack
[00:18:48] of Diamonds five of clubs with only
[00:19:02] weeks to go before the world memory
[00:19:04] championships in Bahrain Ben's eager to
[00:19:07] test his current form against a
[00:19:08] long-standing German rival Germany is
[00:19:12] very much the nerve center with the
[00:19:14] memory world
[00:19:19] before the competition I suppose there's
[00:19:21] a certain amount of tension going on
[00:19:23] this is a much bigger thing than the
[00:19:25] UK's I've got all the best in the world
[00:19:27] going up against me so you know there's
[00:19:29] much more impetus to do something great
[00:19:32] if I'm going to end up with the top
[00:19:33] scorer really I'm going out to beat
[00:19:36] Gunther
[00:19:37] he's certainly beatable although he
[00:19:39] hasn't shown much sign of a over the
[00:19:40] last few years
[00:19:41] 46 year old doctor Gunther Caston has
[00:19:44] previously won the German championship a
[00:19:46] record seven times Ben starts well but
[00:19:53] in his strongest discipline the speed
[00:19:55] cards he tries to memorize his deck too
[00:19:57] quickly
[00:20:06] that was one sticking out like that I
[00:20:11] didn't know what I'd put them together
[00:20:13] in the van hood I thought I'd done it
[00:20:15] right but there was one sticking out
[00:20:16] that I thought was the bottom and I took
[00:20:18] two in I can see what happened dr.
[00:20:43] Gunther Caston is in the best form of
[00:20:46] his life but despite being the dominant
[00:20:48] force in Germany he's never won the
[00:20:51] world of memory title this year he's the
[00:20:54] favorite and he's eager to show what he
[00:20:56] can do in Bahrain I like to compete
[00:21:00] against other people who don't compete
[00:21:03] you just just live without really
[00:21:05] knowing where the lumens are and then
[00:21:07] you maybe waste some of your
[00:21:09] possibilities good his wife Mikayla is
[00:21:16] also a King competitor and together they
[00:21:19] make an efficient partnership 0 0 0 1 0
[00:21:25] 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 when they don't know much
[00:21:33] about the sport I think I'm a genius
[00:21:36] I try to explain it that most of it is
[00:21:42] technique and practice ok oh you are
[00:21:46] good no and it's fine hi-yah I had a
[00:21:53] quite normal memory I could memorize
[00:21:55] memorize I don't know 50 50 digits in an
[00:21:59] hour
[00:22:00] and then I improved and now I'm holding
[00:22:05] the world record memorizing 1949 digits
[00:22:12] one Markovian easily with such are good
[00:22:15] tears consistent performances have made
[00:22:17] him a household name across Germany from
[00:22:23] seen improving his techniques or a
[00:22:26] constant part of everyday life
[00:22:29] even during preparing food
[00:22:32] and practicing for instance was the
[00:22:37] biggest knife cutting onions was a big
[00:22:40] knife he's like schiappa it's it's a
[00:22:43] number 600 na 94 whenever I do this I
[00:22:49] see this number to get the direct link
[00:22:53] between this three-digit number and the
[00:22:57] activity so a lot of activities in
[00:23:00] normal life associated to three-digit
[00:23:04] numbers I'm not really good loser
[00:23:11] normally I am very angry at myself
[00:23:14] because normally I lose because I miss
[00:23:16] make mistakes
[00:23:19] the most important lesson I learned is
[00:23:24] really believe in yourself and to have
[00:23:28] focus on your targets and dreams
[00:23:32] for dr. gunther Caston second place in
[00:23:35] this year's World Championships is not
[00:23:37] an option
[00:23:38] [Music]
[00:23:45] [Music]
[00:23:47] with the world memory finals in Bahrain
[00:23:50] only a few days away
[00:23:52] ette cook is keen to make the most of
[00:23:54] his time currently ranked 17th in the
[00:23:58] world he and training partner Lucas are
[00:24:00] keen to take advantage of some
[00:24:02] high-altitude training in the mountains
[00:24:04] of Austria we're about 25 years old and
[00:24:08] 25 to 27 is basically when you peak we
[00:24:14] are approaching the top of our mnemonic
[00:24:16] game where the sprinters the young guns
[00:24:20] so we've got this year maybe a couple
[00:24:23] more years and then we twitty the
[00:24:24] twilight of our careers and I really
[00:24:26] don't want to do I think nine of us want
[00:24:27] to be in the kind of Tim Henman
[00:24:28] situation where we blew our chance yes I
[00:24:33] met Lucas about four years ago in the
[00:24:35] World Championships in Kuala lumper and
[00:24:37] every year before the Championships we
[00:24:39] come to the mountains where Lucas lives
[00:24:41] as a goatherd and we train up mentally
[00:24:44] and physically and we really attuned
[00:24:46] ourselves before the competition's a
[00:24:48] codeword okay go that come on let's
[00:24:57] go
[00:24:59] the mind can get pretty clogged you know
[00:25:03] when you're down in the city most of it
[00:25:05] emails texts as years Facebook
[00:25:08] appointments to fulfill
[00:25:10] one-zero-zero-one
[00:25:11] repeat coming up here is a million miles
[00:25:16] away from all that stuff so the big
[00:25:17] space is the sense of of purity and
[00:25:20] freshness these are kind of contribute
[00:25:21] to include the Zen mental atmosphere
[00:25:24] which is highly conducive to effective
[00:25:26] no ization zero one so I got a karaoke
[00:25:33] lager yeah so what are you aching half
[00:25:39] an hour of berries and then opened a
[00:25:41] mountain there's a bunch of things you
[00:25:42] gotta eat to get your brain really I'm
[00:25:44] on the nail one of them's eggs raw eggs
[00:25:48] for breakfast
[00:25:49] like is he protein mm-hmm there's
[00:25:51] nothing like it annoying philomon b12
[00:25:53] so that's livers kidneys a fish
[00:25:56] preferably raw
[00:25:57] lots of fruit not a porridge and that
[00:26:01] really feeds into the quality of your
[00:26:02] memorization at the end of the day when
[00:26:08] you're doing your roots do you jump
[00:26:09] through windows oh yeah yeah okay
[00:26:11] through walls mmm something's but yeah
[00:26:16] chicken I didn't walk because I'm
[00:26:18] thinking of them of cleaning my roots
[00:26:20] just going through them with like an
[00:26:22] airbrush rearranging furniture cleaning
[00:26:24] surfaces and just go through all my
[00:26:26] roots through the day before each
[00:26:27] competition and so that they're just
[00:26:30] like sparkling clean of my seven family
[00:26:36] members it's just me and my supportive
[00:26:38] little sister you think this isn't a
[00:26:40] matte waste of time I mean it's fun of
[00:26:42] course but B it reveals stuff about you
[00:26:44] know what works for the mind what what
[00:26:46] works for memory but my guess is a
[00:26:48] amusing quote from Goethe which I hope
[00:26:51] you don't mind my buddy at this point
[00:26:53] which is that all great thoughts have
[00:26:54] been had before the only job is to have
[00:26:56] them again I think that's really true
[00:26:57] about very telling so this stuff was
[00:26:59] known and we just completely forgotten
[00:27:00] it education is kind of based on a sort
[00:27:04] of military psychology a way of keeping
[00:27:06] people off the streets and out of
[00:27:08] trouble
[00:27:09] preparing them for boring jobs in this
[00:27:10] kind of stuff and there are other ways
[00:27:12] of doing things other ways of doing
[00:27:14] education better ways and the upshot is
[00:27:17] is that if this was deeply integrated
[00:27:19] into all our education we have this
[00:27:21] wonderful vivid imaginative
[00:27:23] sophisticated world in all of our minds
[00:27:26] and I think that's obviously something
[00:27:28] to be sought after
[00:27:35] next morning Ed's up bright and early
[00:27:38] there's work to be done before breakfast
[00:27:47] among the players for the number one
[00:27:49] title are been pretty more phenomenal
[00:27:52] numbness this is gonna be a tough one
[00:27:55] good - Karsten
[00:27:57] so German spy looking kind of character
[00:28:00] I'm very very good hyper consistent
[00:28:02] totally determined and my hope is that
[00:28:05] the pressure will come down on them and
[00:28:07] there'll be some sort of mental meltdown
[00:28:09] I get the yips and then I'll just kind
[00:28:12] of ply through and emerge champion of
[00:28:15] the world of memory which will you allow
[00:28:18] me to retire from active life that's the
[00:28:21] dream it's the final countdown to
[00:28:27] Bahrain and German champion dr. Gunther
[00:28:30] Carson's training schedule intensifies I
[00:28:33] competed many times on a World
[00:28:36] Championship and I became a couple of
[00:28:39] times second as world champion but I
[00:28:42] never won them so my motivation is to
[00:28:48] get the first place in Berlin shakes t
[00:28:52] Renan Phoebe fee UK champion been pretty
[00:28:57] more has his own approach to last-minute
[00:28:59] training
[00:29:03] and his brother Joseph is here to help
[00:29:08] [Music]
[00:29:20] I think it's very important web
[00:29:23] preparing for world jefita to be in a
[00:29:25] happy frame with my couldn't drink
[00:29:36] anymore there I think downing that last
[00:29:37] bit of yours was a mistake to be honest
[00:29:48] it's the morning after and following his
[00:29:52] recent TV appearance Ben is feeding
[00:29:54] better than he'd hoped he consonants are
[00:29:57] pretty confident I'm stir well the
[00:30:02] competitions Friday and Saturday I'm
[00:30:04] going back on Sunday so nice little
[00:30:06] holiday feel quite a stir it's very
[00:30:13] important to me that I win this one I
[00:30:14] was very disappointed not to win it last
[00:30:16] year this year I know I'm better than I
[00:30:20] ever have been so if I don't mean it
[00:30:22] this time I'll be extremely disappointed
[00:30:23] goodness of well I'm just going to be
[00:30:29] the main rival there's going to be
[00:30:30] plenty of competition from the others as
[00:30:32] well ed and Lucas they're going to be
[00:30:34] dangerous
[00:30:35] [Music]
[00:30:46] when I see Bahrain
[00:30:49] I see visions of the future
[00:30:51] [Music]
[00:30:56] visions for Humanity and visions for
[00:30:59] prosperity and visions for the mind
[00:31:03] sports of the future this is the
[00:31:08] championships which has the most money
[00:31:10] the most national support the largest
[00:31:13] number of registrations it's going to be
[00:31:16] big and I predict that it's going to be
[00:31:18] really really close
[00:31:20] you got some Titanic battles coming out
[00:31:22] everybody is here to win and one small
[00:31:26] error and there's going to be some other
[00:31:29] grandmaster of memory behind you ready
[00:31:31] to pounce mode 1 701 the Starship
[00:31:37] Enterprise does registry number
[00:31:40] useful mnemonic
[00:31:49] it's hot it's unbelievably hard
[00:31:53] and humid
[00:31:57] I'm sweating like whatever the halal
[00:32:00] equivalent of a pig is
[00:32:09] over the next three days 34 grandmasters
[00:32:13] of memory will battle for supremacy in
[00:32:15] the biggest world memory championships
[00:32:17] ever good morning and welcome and
[00:32:20] greetings from the kingdom of bahrain
[00:32:22] and the world memory championships what
[00:32:25] they do in the world memory
[00:32:26] championships it's like the decathlon in
[00:32:29] athletics it's ten different
[00:32:31] competitions and the overall best in
[00:32:34] each of those ten becomes the world
[00:32:36] champion for example this afternoon the
[00:32:39] competitors will be given a 4,500 digit
[00:32:43] long phone number and they will have to
[00:32:46] memorize as many of those digits as they
[00:32:49] possibly can
[00:32:51] [Music]
[00:32:53] I'm a sort of - telepathy among these
[00:32:56] thank you it's great to be am to be here
[00:33:00] we're surrounded by people who know my
[00:33:02] name you look a sharp today Thanks
[00:33:08] I lost my hat nebula any bul maybe
[00:33:16] you're okay maybe a little mini some not
[00:33:19] clear blur the cloud the nebula cloud
[00:33:21] Vega is in pitch lemme see ya 983 the
[00:33:26] foot slip nebula good good and how about
[00:33:29] the word osmosis the first of the ten
[00:33:34] events are about to begin
[00:33:35] but already the mind games have started
[00:33:38] to close to the composition Gunther
[00:33:41] wants extra sheets for the abstract
[00:33:43] images event competitors have 15 minutes
[00:33:47] to memorize 250 images but Gunton knows
[00:33:50] he can do more more images will give him
[00:33:54] more points the rest of the competitors
[00:33:58] are kept waiting maybe I will decide not
[00:34:03] to compete and that is another important
[00:34:09] year
[00:34:11] I think we're gonna get hit with extra
[00:34:13] page otherwise we're not gonna get the
[00:34:15] competition started okay thanks
[00:34:22] [Music]
[00:34:24] I think he takes things to heart my he
[00:34:28] he's more serious about the whole
[00:34:31] attitude and really these distractions
[00:34:34] are just part and parcel for competition
[00:34:37] [Music]
[00:34:40] Gunter's mind games pay off he wins the
[00:34:44] event and takes an early lead dr.
[00:34:48] Gunther Carson well I'm really happy
[00:34:53] that I won this this discipline that was
[00:34:55] important for me I wanted to have a
[00:34:57] better result but we have a gold medal
[00:35:00] and that discipline this is a good start
[00:35:03] next is a chance for Ben to fight back
[00:35:05] it's his favourite event the binary
[00:35:08] digits for the next 30 minutes Ben will
[00:35:12] turn thousands of zeros and ones into
[00:35:14] characters and create a unique visual
[00:35:16] story on which is sitting at Kestrel hey
[00:35:33] man I used in binaries 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1
[00:35:37] 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 the Blue Beetle
[00:35:48] ivenna Ben has successfully remembered
[00:35:59] 4140 binary digits in 30 minutes it's a
[00:36:03] new world record during the break
[00:36:12] gunther takes stock he's been shaken by
[00:36:16] Ben's performance
[00:36:18] I'm leading in competition but then has
[00:36:23] shown that he's in top form top shape
[00:36:25] with his new world record binary numbers
[00:36:28] so maybe I have to be satisfied with the
[00:36:31] second place and see Tim Petroff Yahtzee
[00:36:50] [Applause]
[00:36:53] well it's like juggling it makes you
[00:36:56] using both sides of your brain together
[00:36:58] so it raises the concentration now it's
[00:37:02] the marathon cart discipline where
[00:37:04] competitors have one hour to memorize as
[00:37:07] many decks of cards as possible Ben
[00:37:11] holds the world record of 1404 cards and
[00:37:14] he's hoping to win the event and take
[00:37:16] the overall lead in the competition this
[00:37:19] is one of my favorites but there's
[00:37:22] definitely the possibility of going
[00:37:23] wrong with things in
[00:37:26] at the moment the world records 27 facts
[00:37:30] which I did last year with any luck or
[00:37:32] beat that this time left I was going
[00:37:34] first 30 packs I got 27 right this time
[00:37:38] I'm going for 33 all together unless I
[00:37:41] feel like doing something mad and going
[00:37:43] for 36 and spur-of-the-moment oh yes
[00:37:46] far more than 30 that is what I expected
[00:37:49] he has a world record was 27 I think and
[00:37:52] there was already last year yeah I think
[00:37:54] he practice a lot so he would even do it
[00:37:57] there's very impressive in search of
[00:38:01] another record Ben will be using his
[00:38:03] visualization technique to travel along
[00:38:05] some familiar routes
[00:38:06] today we're going around at the
[00:38:09] Cambridge then Nottingham
[00:38:10] burton-on-trent Medical Centre in
[00:38:13] Sheffield and Bao page but to finish off
[00:38:31] there are many different systems easy
[00:38:34] ones and very very complicated and
[00:38:36] time-consuming ones and Ben has the most
[00:38:40] complicated system his system to have
[00:38:42] his system is an enormous advantage
[00:38:45] because he looks at two cards at the
[00:38:47] same time and two cards is a picture for
[00:38:50] him those combinations are more than
[00:38:52] 2700 to memorize this system is like
[00:38:56] knowing another language with my system
[00:39:00] I have to memorize double as much as he
[00:39:13] bends cards are the first to be marked
[00:39:18] he's gone for broke by attempting a new
[00:39:21] world record of 1872 cards eight four
[00:39:26] hundred more than his previous best if
[00:39:28] he gets it right the world title will
[00:39:31] almost certainly be his all good until
[00:39:43] conditions mocking Ben's papers he got
[00:39:46] ten and a half packs of cards right and
[00:39:48] rent for a possible thirty six you would
[00:39:50] have broken the world record
[00:39:51] unfortunately it wasn't his day
[00:39:54] been ludicrously stupidly tried to do 36
[00:39:58] decks of cards there's about a one in a
[00:40:00] hundred chance he'll do that and Julie
[00:40:01] he got ten and a half couldn't to nail
[00:40:03] the save 20 and so we find ourselves in
[00:40:05] the position that they're absolutely
[00:40:06] neck-and-neck it's the final day of the
[00:40:17] world memory championships and the
[00:40:19] competition couldn't be tighter German
[00:40:23] champion Gunther and UK champion Ben are
[00:40:26] neck-and-neck we all live also for
[00:40:31] mistake some of the others so I got a
[00:40:34] chance to probably overtake him the
[00:40:38] chance is still very big that I might
[00:40:41] win relax
[00:40:48] well sometimes not very rarely somehow
[00:40:52] where problems were there although most
[00:41:00] of the press attention is on the big
[00:41:02] guns
[00:41:02] Edie cook is enjoying performing on the
[00:41:05] world stage he's about to start the
[00:41:09] spoken numbers event waiting they speak
[00:41:14] one number per second for a hundred
[00:41:17] seconds and the scoring system is such
[00:41:19] that if you make an error on say the
[00:41:21] seventh digit you ain't get six points
[00:41:22] if you've got the rest correct well the
[00:41:25] we decomposers freak out and panic
[00:41:35] Nyquist our three princess time to go
[00:41:45] [Music]
[00:41:53] [Applause]
[00:41:55] [Music]
[00:42:00] [Music]
[00:42:03] [Applause]
[00:42:09] so I've just got a perfect score on the
[00:42:11] spoken numbers 100 numbers spoken one
[00:42:13] per second remember them all
[00:42:15] that doesn't happen unless you train it
[00:42:17] attitude that doesn't happen unless you
[00:42:19] spend an awful lot of time in the gym
[00:42:21] and the strategy room over the whole
[00:42:23] course of the year it's nothing we
[00:42:24] haven't of the day it's something you
[00:42:26] prepare for the final event of the
[00:42:30] competition is the speed cards and it's
[00:42:33] the one in which Ben has made his name
[00:42:35] it's it seems than going in to the speed
[00:42:38] cards you you and Ben are literally
[00:42:41] within one point that has never happened
[00:42:44] before I know the logical thing is to do
[00:42:47] a safe one first and make sure I get
[00:42:49] second place at least now is that 30
[00:42:53] seconds is a risky one a safe one is one
[00:42:55] minute that would make sure I get second
[00:42:57] place to beat Gunther Ben not only needs
[00:43:01] a perfect score but a faster time unsure
[00:43:05] of his tactics Ben is given a timely
[00:43:07] reminder that he's the best in the world
[00:43:09] at this event so it can't be rather fun
[00:43:11] at times twenty six point two eight only
[00:43:14] when I turn down this might actually be
[00:43:16] the same one but I did that time on they
[00:43:20] just gave me one at random I'm happy
[00:43:26] with this lucky omen of having got the
[00:43:27] same time and that I used to break the
[00:43:28] record with six weeks ago this final
[00:43:35] event will decide the next memory
[00:43:36] champion of the world
[00:43:52] [Music]
[00:44:01] Ben's gone for broke and stops the clock
[00:44:04] at just over 32 seconds
[00:44:07] Gunther memorizes his pack in just over
[00:44:10] 47 Ben now duplicates the memorized pack
[00:44:21] if his recall is faultless
[00:44:24] he'll be the next world memory champion
[00:44:41] so awesome piece and it's very big
[00:44:47] things for each other and son
[00:44:59] damn fellas much
[00:45:09] I'm sure someone
[00:45:20] [Applause]
[00:45:22] Goodin t'as memorization those slower
[00:45:24] than benz is faultless
[00:45:27] he's the new memory champion of the
[00:45:30] world
[00:45:37] that was the closest going
[00:45:41] [Music]
[00:45:46] [Music]
[00:45:57] well I'm a little annoyed with myself
[00:45:59] and disappointed to have lost but great
[00:46:02] that Gunter's finally got a world
[00:46:03] championship onto his belt
[00:46:04] after all these years it's been a lot of
[00:46:07] fun and well just have to do better next
[00:46:13] year won't I I think I I won't because I
[00:46:20] had a better strategy and really stick
[00:46:22] to the strategy and was the right one if
[00:46:27] I would be a pen I would be very angry
[00:46:29] about myself knowing probably that he is
[00:46:32] maybe the better one but didn't show it
[00:46:35] because the strategies were wrong doing
[00:46:39] this is a number 841
[00:46:43] during the back of the telly I will
[00:46:48] enjoy this victory now for a certain
[00:46:51] time then I would set another target and
[00:46:53] try to go for it that's how life works
[00:46:59] it's always a bit of a drag to go back
[00:47:01] to reality going back to being just one
[00:47:05] off a cackle of accountants year-end
[00:47:08] accounts
[00:47:09] [Music]


=== HOW TO MEMORIZE AN ENTIRE CHESS BOARD ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN8VM3EBCsA

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:01] and I think in many ways it's the same
[00:00:05] with chess that you have this pattern
[00:00:08] recognition you have a lot of analysis
[00:00:10] going on and you are presented to the
[00:00:12] result but you don't really know how you
[00:00:14] reach the ocean it's like learning a
[00:00:18] language with which s that you where are
[00:00:21] others here or C chaos you see you see
[00:00:25] clear lines and you see patterns it is a
[00:00:28] pattern that has to be recognized by
[00:00:30] your brain and if it doesn't get the
[00:00:32] clues you cannot see problems but you
[00:00:34] have a great ability to remember so you
[00:00:36] can remember a lot of chess games a lot
[00:00:38] of musicians that are specific materials
[00:00:41] [Music]
[00:00:56] what's up guys Nelson Dellis here and in
[00:00:59] today's video we are gonna learn how we
[00:01:03] memorize an entire chess board you ready
[00:01:07] let's go
[00:01:16] [Music]
[00:01:22] alright guys welcome and thank you for
[00:01:24] watching this video I hope you liked
[00:01:26] that intro a little different something
[00:01:27] out of the norm a little over the top
[00:01:29] this is about something so grand as
[00:01:31] chess and what I thought I'd do in this
[00:01:33] video is teach you anybody whether you
[00:01:36] know chess well or you don't how to
[00:01:38] memorize all the pieces on a chess board
[00:01:42] so at 8x8 regular chess board and 32
[00:01:45] pieces both black and white spread out
[00:01:48] randomly across this board how to
[00:01:51] remember where they are take them off
[00:01:53] and place them back in the same spot now
[00:01:55] before we get started a couple little
[00:01:57] notes I should get out there one is that
[00:01:59] I'm no chess expert I like to play chess
[00:02:01] I'm pretty good at it I wouldn't
[00:02:03] consider myself great by any means nor
[00:02:05] am i rated or anything like that
[00:02:07] so I'm approaching this from the
[00:02:09] perspective of a memory champion not a
[00:02:11] chess champion let's get that clear the
[00:02:14] second point I'd like to bring up is I
[00:02:15] know that memorizing a chess board with
[00:02:18] random pieces anywhere it's not really
[00:02:21] useful for the game of chess cuz a lot
[00:02:23] of the configurations you could randomly
[00:02:25] come up with will never appear in any
[00:02:27] chess game now there's this famous
[00:02:28] anecdote about a study where you know
[00:02:31] chess players have been tested on
[00:02:33] memorizing boards and when it's some
[00:02:35] kind of chess related configuration that
[00:02:39] might actually happen the game or mimic
[00:02:40] some kind of opening they can do it
[00:02:42] really easily but if you put the chess
[00:02:57] pieces in any random order their memory
[00:03:00] was no better than the average person
[00:03:01] it's really interesting so then the
[00:03:06] question is well what's the point the
[00:03:08] point is it's a great memory exercise
[00:03:09] and it's kind of a cool little parlor
[00:03:12] trick to show how powerful the memory
[00:03:14] can be all right let's get started
[00:03:19] so there's gonna be two different
[00:03:22] approaches I'm gonna cover in this video
[00:03:23] the first one will be for absolutely
[00:03:25] anybody I'll show you how to get it
[00:03:27] started there's not really much prep you
[00:03:29] need the second method will be a little
[00:03:31] more advanced if you have a number
[00:03:33] system I talked about this a lot in
[00:03:35] other videos for those of you that do
[00:03:37] have a number system go to this time
[00:03:38] stamp right now and I'll show you
[00:03:39] another way to do this that takes
[00:03:41] advantage of your already set number
[00:03:44] system now here are the broad-strokes
[00:03:45] what are we gonna do okay so there are
[00:03:47] 32 pieces on this board right 16 on the
[00:03:51] black side 16 on the white side and a
[00:03:54] lot of them are mirror images of each
[00:03:55] other right
[00:03:56] there's pawns on this side pawns on this
[00:03:58] side there's ninths rooks bishops and
[00:04:00] clean all that stuff so what the goal is
[00:04:03] is to come up with a picture and an
[00:04:06] action for each of these pieces both
[00:04:08] black and white and then when we want to
[00:04:10] memorize them we're going to imagine
[00:04:11] this board this 8x8 64 location board as
[00:04:15] a map to a real-life memory palace and
[00:04:19] I'll show you how to do that in just a
[00:04:21] moment first thing we need to do is come
[00:04:24] up with an image for all 32 pieces
[00:04:26] sounds difficult but a lot of these are
[00:04:28] actually already some kind of very
[00:04:30] memorable image so maybe we can play on
[00:04:32] that
[00:04:37] all right so as I said before each piece
[00:04:40] is gonna have a person and also an
[00:04:42] action associated with it I'll show you
[00:04:44] why when we start to use the memory
[00:04:47] palace but for now just follow along so
[00:04:49] let's start with our Kings here the two
[00:04:52] biggest pieces on the board we have the
[00:04:54] black and the white when I think King I
[00:04:56] think immediately of King Kong he's the
[00:04:58] king of gorillas and he's got black fur
[00:05:00] so he can be the black piece here at the
[00:05:02] camp since that's animal movie theme
[00:05:04] then maybe I should choose Simba from
[00:05:06] The Lion King he's the king and he's got
[00:05:08] a lighter shade of fur so I have King
[00:05:11] Kong and The Lion King
[00:05:12] now a side note whatever I come up with
[00:05:15] here don't feel like you're obligated to
[00:05:16] keep the same feel free to write down
[00:05:18] your own I'm just gonna use some
[00:05:19] suggestions and maybe for actions I'll
[00:05:22] think of him he's pounding like a chef
[00:05:25] so King Kong pounding and The Lion King
[00:05:28] okay next up let's do the Queens all
[00:05:32] right Queen I think of like a queen bee
[00:05:35] since they're black and yellow buzzing
[00:05:37] around so maybe it's the queen bee she's
[00:05:39] the black Queen and her action is making
[00:05:42] a buzzing sound and then for the White
[00:05:44] Queen we can think of the Queen of
[00:05:45] England because she has a white hair
[00:05:46] maybe her action is sitting because I
[00:05:48] imagine her just sitting on the throne
[00:05:52] bishops
[00:05:53] alright Bishop I think of someone holy
[00:05:55] maybe a priest right and kind of wears
[00:05:57] black attire so he's the black piece and
[00:06:01] then the white piece maybe it's the Pope
[00:06:02] right he's always plaid and white
[00:06:06] [Music]
[00:06:13] now for actions maybe for the priests I
[00:06:16] imagine him praying right whatever that
[00:06:18] means to your in your mind and then for
[00:06:20] the white Pope I imagine him waving
[00:06:22] giving that Pope wave alright next up we
[00:06:25] have Knights the horses they look like
[00:06:29] horses so I think the most
[00:06:30] straightforward thing we could do is
[00:06:32] picture some kind of horse
[00:06:34] so maybe the black will be like a black
[00:06:36] stallion kind of horse and then maybe a
[00:06:38] white could be a unicorn horse rifles
[00:06:41] are typically white and they're quite
[00:06:43] distinct in that sense anyways and if
[00:06:45] our actions may be horse could be riding
[00:06:47] these right a horse and then a unicorn
[00:06:49] could be the action of flying because
[00:06:52] you know plants flying next we have the
[00:06:54] rooks or the castles so Castle makes me
[00:06:57] think of like a medieval kind of game
[00:07:00] thrones kind of thing so maybe the black
[00:07:03] one could be an executioner I had to see
[00:07:05] this executioner all clad in black it's
[00:07:07] got a pass maybe maybe the white one
[00:07:10] could be like a knight shining white and
[00:07:17] their actions executioner I think of
[00:07:19] them swinging down an axe blow and then
[00:07:22] the knight here could be fighting with a
[00:07:24] sword and then finally we just have the
[00:07:27] pawns here the smallest pieces on there
[00:07:30] and yeah there's a lot of them but
[00:07:31] that's okay
[00:07:32] pawn sounds to me like prawn so I think
[00:07:35] of like a shrimp or some kind of maybe
[00:07:39] sea fish it's a pawn prawn fish whatever
[00:07:42] some kind of black fish maybe we could
[00:07:44] think wow that's not a fish I was gonna
[00:07:46] say an orca whale I think it's a mammal
[00:07:49] so whatever that's some kind of aquatic
[00:07:52] animal so we have it Orca for the black
[00:07:55] one and then for the white one could be
[00:07:57] our shrimp because they're kind of pink
[00:07:59] white and in terms of actions for the
[00:08:01] orca whale I just picture Orca swimming
[00:08:03] really fast
[00:08:04] in the ocean maybe for the shrimp I
[00:08:06] think of the action of eating because
[00:08:08] they eat shrimp
[00:08:11] okay all right now that you have your
[00:08:16] images the next step is to figure out
[00:08:18] how to make this board a memory palace
[00:08:20] so for now let's clear the board all
[00:08:28] right
[00:08:28] and notice that we have eight squares
[00:08:32] across and eight rows up what you could
[00:08:36] easily do is have a memory palace with
[00:08:38] 64 locations and put something in each
[00:08:41] of them now the question is well what if
[00:08:44] it's empty right there's 32 pieces 64
[00:08:46] slots half of those are gonna be empty
[00:08:49] so whenever something is empty just
[00:08:51] don't put anything there when you're
[00:08:54] going back through your memory palace
[00:08:55] and you don't remember seeing anything
[00:08:58] there it means there was no peace there
[00:08:59] simple as that now 64 items that's a bit
[00:09:02] long so we do better than that and
[00:09:04] that's where the action comes in so what
[00:09:06] I'm gonna do is every two squares is
[00:09:08] gonna be a person action combo and so
[00:09:11] that means that every row only needs
[00:09:14] four images four times eight rows that's
[00:09:16] 32 so half the images now that you mean
[00:09:19] instead of 64 great so if I have two
[00:09:22] pieces in consecutive squares it would
[00:09:24] be the first one as a person the second
[00:09:26] one has the action and you made it into
[00:09:27] one image put it on that location and
[00:09:29] you continue down the board you can go
[00:09:32] whatever direction you want I like to
[00:09:34] start down closest to me from left to
[00:09:36] right and there work my way to the back
[00:09:38] of the board
[00:09:38] now there's four scenarios right there
[00:09:40] could be two pieces on a pair of squares
[00:09:42] there could be one piece on the left one
[00:09:45] that's the person or there could be one
[00:09:46] piece on just the right that would just
[00:09:49] be an action and then there could also
[00:09:50] be none on either none on either we
[00:09:52] don't picture anything pieces on both
[00:09:54] you do person action if there's just a
[00:09:57] person then you just picture the person
[00:09:59] if there's just an action you just
[00:10:01] picture a generic action happening to
[00:10:03] that thing you don't have to specify
[00:10:04] who's doing it and in the case of just a
[00:10:07] person you'd have to specify what
[00:10:08] they're doing they're just there sounds
[00:10:10] like a little complication but it's
[00:10:11] really easy to visualize
[00:10:13] that way when you imagine when you have
[00:10:15] two pieces that are a person and an
[00:10:17] action it's very clear that there are
[00:10:19] two pieces there a person and an action
[00:10:21] and when there's just one piece on
[00:10:23] either one it's very clear whether it's
[00:10:25] just the person or just an action
[00:10:27] obviously if there's nothing there it's
[00:10:29] very clear that there's nothing there so
[00:10:31] I think the next logical thing is to do
[00:10:34] an example all right so we have this
[00:10:40] random setup here I just randomly put
[00:10:42] all of those 32 pieces on this board and
[00:10:45] as I said before I would start in this
[00:10:47] bottom left corner and go row by row all
[00:10:49] the way until I reached the very end
[00:10:51] corner here going in pairs now to make
[00:10:54] my life a little easier so I can see
[00:10:56] each row I'm gonna make each row kind of
[00:10:58] its own little area in my memory palace
[00:11:01] so the first location in my memory
[00:11:03] palace will be my dining room here
[00:11:04] stopping at each of these four locations
[00:11:06] within this space then we go into the
[00:11:09] kind of the entryway here and I'll have
[00:11:10] four different locations in that spot as
[00:11:12] well then continuing that same process
[00:11:15] for six more areas remember you can use
[00:11:18] any memory palace you want it doesn't
[00:11:20] really matter let's just go through an
[00:11:21] example here so what would I see so I
[00:11:23] start here with the first two images and
[00:11:25] I have a white pawn in the person slot
[00:11:29] what is the person or living thing
[00:11:31] associated with this item is a shrimp
[00:11:35] and the second one here since there is
[00:11:37] another piece there is the knight and
[00:11:39] it's a Black Knight right which was the
[00:11:43] black stallion
[00:11:43] but it's the action it's the second item
[00:11:46] in that pair that's always the action so
[00:11:48] it's a shrimp writing and imagine riding
[00:11:51] a bike riding a horse doesn't matter
[00:11:52] he's just doing the action or right now
[00:11:54] I'm gonna put this up against the back
[00:11:56] wall of my first area that's the first
[00:12:00] location and what's happening there well
[00:12:02] there's a little shrimp just riding
[00:12:04] along all over the wall leaving a trail
[00:12:07] of slime other knights got his little
[00:12:09] shrimp tentacles
[00:12:11] the shrimp little legs just kind of
[00:12:12] wiggling as he's riding along the wall
[00:12:14] then we move on to the next location
[00:12:15] which will be my dog's cage in the
[00:12:17] corner and the next two locations
[00:12:20] there's an empty slot here for the
[00:12:22] person but there's a white shrimp for
[00:12:25] the action so on top of that cage I'm
[00:12:28] going to picture no person but the
[00:12:30] action that's happening to that cage is
[00:12:32] whatever action is associated with the
[00:12:34] white pop pawn prawn shrimp but with the
[00:12:38] action it was eating so just imagine
[00:12:40] yourself since you're the one picturing
[00:12:42] it but you're eating this cage the next
[00:12:44] location is the table in the middle of
[00:12:46] the dining room and there's nothing
[00:12:48] there so I literally just move along I
[00:12:50] don't think of anything then the last
[00:12:52] location is this little table stand
[00:12:55] where we put our shoes and keys and
[00:12:56] stuff like that in the corner of this
[00:12:58] room and we have the King white King The
[00:13:01] Lion King and then no action so just
[00:13:04] play Simba there he's just chillin
[00:13:06] that's it let's do one more row just to
[00:13:08] get the hang of it
[00:13:09] so the next location area is by my front
[00:13:12] door and I have four locations I'm gonna
[00:13:13] start on the mirror then I'm gonna go to
[00:13:15] the dresser then the floor between the
[00:13:18] dress from the door and then the door
[00:13:19] itself that's four locations in that
[00:13:21] little area there's nothing in the
[00:13:23] mirror what's the first two slots then
[00:13:25] on the dresser there's no person but
[00:13:28] there's an action and it's the black
[00:13:30] queen which is the queen bee
[00:13:32] she's buzzing that's the action so
[00:13:34] somebody is buzzing at that dresser then
[00:13:38] on the floor in between the door and the
[00:13:39] dresser no person again but we have the
[00:13:41] action of the white Bishop white Bishop
[00:13:44] is the Pope or the Pope to p-waves so
[00:13:47] the floor is waving or maybe you're
[00:13:48] waving at the floor like who knows why
[00:13:52] you're doing that
[00:13:53] and then finally on the door we have the
[00:13:55] last one which is a shrimp do we nothing
[00:13:58] there you go
[00:14:01] all right so let's memorize this board
[00:14:04] I've already done the first two rows so
[00:14:06] just kind of bear with me as I try to
[00:14:08] encode the rest here
[00:14:21] okay so let's go gosh why did I do that
[00:14:29] okay so starting down here on the wall
[00:14:31] we had the white bishop he was writing
[00:14:35] which was a black knight then we had
[00:14:39] nothing and we were eating
[00:14:41] that's a shrimp the cage and we had
[00:14:44] nothing on the table and then we had the
[00:14:46] Lion King who's the white king he's just
[00:14:50] sitting there
[00:14:50] cool first location done in the mirror
[00:14:53] we have nothing and then we had the
[00:14:57] black queen was buzzing the dresser on
[00:15:01] the floor we were waving that was the
[00:15:05] white priest waving the Pope and then
[00:15:09] finally on the door we just had a shrimp
[00:15:12] chilling there
[00:15:13] [Music]
[00:15:19] I think that's right yeah all right
[00:15:32] let's quickly talk about the other
[00:15:33] option if you have a number system this
[00:15:36] is the way to go so basically for all
[00:15:38] the pieces except a few I give a number
[00:15:41] from 0 to 9 just one digit and what I
[00:15:45] like to do is 0 will be an empty square
[00:15:48] 1 could be the black pawn 2 could be the
[00:15:52] white pawn 3 could be the black rook 4
[00:15:55] could be the white rook and so on up
[00:15:58] until you get to 9 which if you go by
[00:16:00] increasingly large the size 9 would be
[00:16:02] maybe the black Queen what do you do for
[00:16:04] the White Queen the black king and the
[00:16:06] White King so for those just find them
[00:16:09] it's just three pieces so just remember
[00:16:11] where they are in this case the Kings
[00:16:12] are here and the Queen is in the corner
[00:16:14] that's really easy to just glance at at
[00:16:16] the end so you're gonna go from the
[00:16:17] bottom left here and just encode each
[00:16:19] row as if you were reading a number I do
[00:16:22] an eight-digit PA oh so memorizing a row
[00:16:24] just one image to me you would have a
[00:16:26] three digit person two-digit action
[00:16:28] three digit objects and remember empty
[00:16:31] spaces are just zeros if it's gonna be
[00:16:33] one of those remaining three pieces the
[00:16:35] white or black King or the White Queen
[00:16:38] for now the beginning I just imagine it
[00:16:40] as an empty spot and then when I'm done
[00:16:42] the last thing I do is I could take a
[00:16:44] quick snapshot of those three pieces and
[00:16:46] then probably when the board is cleared
[00:16:49] and I'm recalling I would place those
[00:16:50] first because they're from my short-term
[00:16:52] memory
[00:16:54] there you go guys I hope that was really
[00:16:57] interesting I know a lot of you guys
[00:16:58] find chests fascinating but it's a
[00:17:01] really beautiful game and memory plays a
[00:17:04] big part in that a lot of the lore in
[00:17:06] chess kind of resides around these
[00:17:08] blindfold matches and you know Grand
[00:17:11] Master's being able to play you know ten
[00:17:13] twenty thirty blindfolded games at once
[00:17:16] which is astonishing but they're
[00:17:19] probably using some kind of memory
[00:17:20] palace technique again it's different
[00:17:23] than this because they'll actually have
[00:17:25] familiarity with where the pieces are in
[00:17:27] terms of opening moves and games and
[00:17:29] things like that but it's still an
[00:17:31] incredible feat nonetheless anyways
[00:17:32] thanks for watching guys if you have any
[00:17:34] questions about chess or any
[00:17:36] recommendations for anything related
[00:17:38] chess please let me know in the
[00:17:40] description I'd love to hear more from
[00:17:42] some of you chess experts and hear what
[00:17:44] you think maybe you have another
[00:17:45] strategy that works better this seems to
[00:17:48] have worked for me and I've talked to a
[00:17:49] few other memory people who have tried
[00:17:51] memorizing a chess board and they kind
[00:17:53] of on the same page as me so I think I'm
[00:17:56] onto something maybe not the best but I
[00:17:57] think it works pretty well thanks for
[00:17:59] watching guys please like share
[00:18:00] subscribe and I will see you in the next
[00:18:04] video I'm out

=== HOW TO READ MORE BOOKS (52 books in a year) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T2v4HmXecQ

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:13] here are all the books that I've read in
[00:00:15] the past year
[00:00:16] add in some ebooks some audio books and
[00:00:20] you've got over 50 books that I was able
[00:00:23] to consume within a one-year period now
[00:00:31] in a time where we have a lot of time at
[00:00:34] home a lot of time to read theoretically
[00:00:37] it's not always easy to read and even
[00:00:41] though we have the best intentions to
[00:00:43] read we want to we buy books I buy books
[00:00:45] compulsively but until recently they
[00:00:49] just sat there i wanted to read them but
[00:00:51] i just couldn't get through these books
[00:00:53] i'd have a book or two by my bedside and
[00:00:55] it would be there for months
[00:00:56] painstakingly going through it not
[00:00:59] making much progress but then about a
[00:01:01] year ago i decided to change that i
[00:01:03] wanted to get through all these books
[00:01:04] that i had collected that i wanted to
[00:01:06] read and all the books that I had on
[00:01:08] wish lists and things that I wanted to
[00:01:10] read I was gonna read them or I was
[00:01:11] gonna try really hard to read as many as
[00:01:13] I could in a year but enjoy them this
[00:01:15] wasn't a race my goal was to read at
[00:01:17] least 52 books in a year one for every
[00:01:21] week
[00:01:21] [Music]
[00:01:26] so the premise of this video is super
[00:01:29] simple I'm gonna share with you some
[00:01:30] tips that I learned learn from others on
[00:01:33] how to read more that's it a bit cramped
[00:01:37] here I've been at home for the last two
[00:01:38] months so let's talk about this outside
[00:01:42] [Music]
[00:01:55] so as a young kid I read a ton you know
[00:01:59] I think I read starting when I was three
[00:02:02] super young and I just always ask my
[00:02:04] parents for more and more books I would
[00:02:06] read them I couldn't stop and that
[00:02:08] carried on through my high school
[00:02:10] college years but somewhere in the midst
[00:02:13] of my adult professional life I stopped
[00:02:16] reading it's not that I didn't want to I
[00:02:18] still loved books I would buy tons of
[00:02:21] books filling up my shelves but I just
[00:02:24] would never get to them and it
[00:02:26] frustrated me but I still didn't do
[00:02:29] anything about it so about a year ago I
[00:02:31] stumble upon this video okay it's a bug
[00:02:38] so this is the book that you're gonna
[00:02:40] read this year okay this is the book
[00:02:42] that you might not finish because you're
[00:02:44] gonna die while reading this book here
[00:02:47] and I gave myself this bowl of I'm gonna
[00:02:52] read 52 books at least in this next year
[00:02:55] one per week on average now over the
[00:02:58] course of the year I learned a lot of
[00:03:00] things from that video from other video
[00:03:02] from reading things about reading more
[00:03:05] and I've kind of compiled them into this
[00:03:07] video to share with you so that you guys
[00:03:09] can start reading more as well
[00:03:15] [Music]
[00:03:29] so one of the things I want to first
[00:03:31] clear up I did a video about speed
[00:03:34] reading and reading faster more
[00:03:36] efficiently and remembering it all did
[00:03:38] that back end of last year and all of
[00:03:41] you guys loved that video but some of
[00:03:43] you guys gave me a lot of crap for it
[00:03:44] saying why do you want to read a book
[00:03:46] fast why don't you just enjoy it and I
[00:03:49] thought I made that clear in the video I
[00:03:50] want you to be able to re faster
[00:03:53] enjoyably and to remember the you
[00:03:56] read but just in case I didn't I'm gonna
[00:04:04] make this perfectly clear right now I am
[00:04:06] not advocating that you should be speed
[00:04:09] reading or flying through books
[00:04:11] sometimes it's stuff that you want to
[00:04:13] get through quicker because you have a
[00:04:14] deadline for whatever reason sometimes
[00:04:16] it's your favorite topic or story and
[00:04:19] once you really absorb it so you take
[00:04:21] your time now all I was saying in that
[00:04:23] video is there are some techniques that
[00:04:25] you can apply to increase your speed
[00:04:27] just a little bit not so that it's a
[00:04:30] speed read but that it's a quicker read
[00:04:32] more efficient and you remember more
[00:04:34] isn't that really the goal to remember
[00:04:36] more
[00:04:38] alright enough of that let's get to it
[00:04:43] [Music]
[00:04:47] alright so the first tip I have is to
[00:04:50] prioritize it sounds obvious but with
[00:04:53] anything that you want to do you have to
[00:04:55] make it a priority for you to make
[00:04:57] progress in it you're just gonna say
[00:04:59] I'll read whenever I will you might
[00:05:01] fight you probably won't read as much
[00:05:03] like but if you say I'm gonna prioritize
[00:05:06] this I'm gonna start making lists of
[00:05:08] books that I want to read and I'm gonna
[00:05:10] make it a priority not a pastime
[00:05:12] something that I want to do you're gonna
[00:05:15] end up doing it more more or less so one
[00:05:18] of the things that worked for me to get
[00:05:19] started was I created a list a wish list
[00:05:21] or kind of a want to read list you can
[00:05:25] do this in Google Docs Amazon wishlist
[00:05:27] or Goodreads it's just something that
[00:05:30] you can look at and say okay that's what
[00:05:32] I'm reading next that's what I'm reading
[00:05:33] next you can mark things off once you
[00:05:35] read them and then move on to the next
[00:05:36] one
[00:05:39] [Music]
[00:05:44] all right the next one is this was a
[00:05:47] game-changer for me and the idea is to
[00:05:49] read everywhere everywhere whether
[00:05:53] you're in the shower in your car sitting
[00:05:56] down for lunch it's about to go to bed
[00:05:58] on the couch
[00:05:59] whatever try to read everywhere
[00:06:02] reasonably obviously there's gonna be
[00:06:04] some situations where it's rude to do
[00:06:05] that we're just impossible but you get
[00:06:08] what I mean there are so many times when
[00:06:10] we're just looking at our phone
[00:06:10] mindlessly scrolling playing some stupid
[00:06:13] game but that's when you should be
[00:06:14] reading okay and you're watching this
[00:06:15] video because you want to read so I'm
[00:06:17] not saying stop doing the things that
[00:06:19] you like on your phone and read no I'm
[00:06:21] just saying if you want to read more
[00:06:23] prioritize it and read everywhere now
[00:06:27] what helps obviously is can always carry
[00:06:30] this massive book around so that's why I
[00:06:32] had some books that I read in the flesh
[00:06:34] but I had a lot of audiobooks that I
[00:06:37] could listen to when I just had my phone
[00:06:38] or I also had ebooks which I could also
[00:06:41] look on my phone as a PDF or through my
[00:06:44] e-reader when I was climbing a mountain
[00:06:45] I always made sure that I had some way
[00:06:48] to read a book wherever I was now this
[00:06:51] is right where I should put a ad for
[00:06:53] some kind of audiobook service but
[00:06:55] nobody sponsored me so you're in luck
[00:06:58] because this is not a sponsored video
[00:07:00] [Music]
[00:07:07] alright so the next tip and you can
[00:07:10] watch my old video for this one it's
[00:07:12] basically reads smart so if you want to
[00:07:14] read more but obviously reading
[00:07:16] efficiently I mean reading at a moderate
[00:07:18] pace you want to have some way of being
[00:07:21] efficient with your reading if you watch
[00:07:22] my old video it's 10 tips on how to read
[00:07:25] more efficiently quicker and retain it
[00:07:28] all so don't read like an idiot read
[00:07:31] smart
[00:07:32] [Music]
[00:07:42] alright this tip I think was one of the
[00:07:46] game changers for me and it goes like
[00:07:49] this
[00:07:49] stop reading books that suck if you
[00:07:53] don't like a book are you just not
[00:07:55] getting through it
[00:07:56] it's not interesting or it's kind of
[00:07:58] boring too wordy too easy
[00:08:01] then stop I used to think that I have to
[00:08:04] finish every single book and that was
[00:08:06] debilitating to me because I'd be stuck
[00:08:08] with this one book that I chose and I
[00:08:10] hated it so don't be afraid to put a
[00:08:12] book down put it aside you always come
[00:08:14] back to later but move on to another
[00:08:16] book so kind of in line with the
[00:08:27] previous tip this also helped me a lot
[00:08:29] too if you're interested in something or
[00:08:32] you hear about a book that you want to
[00:08:33] read read it right then you will read
[00:08:36] way faster if you're reading something
[00:08:37] that you are so interested in right now
[00:08:40] an interest can Lane right it can change
[00:08:42] it can fluctuate you might see something
[00:08:43] new the next week and then you've lost
[00:08:44] interests for what you wanted to read
[00:08:46] the previous week so basically if you in
[00:08:48] the middle of something and suddenly
[00:08:50] something else piques your interest go
[00:08:52] ahead and read that you're gonna make
[00:08:54] more progress in that book or in your
[00:08:55] reading goals if you go for what you
[00:08:57] want which leads me to my next tip
[00:09:02] [Music]
[00:09:07] that's it is read multiple books at the
[00:09:11] same time I mean sometimes I will even
[00:09:13] have a book that I'm listening to an
[00:09:14] audio book an e-book or two that I'm
[00:09:16] reading on a device and then maybe two
[00:09:18] real books that I'm reading by hand
[00:09:20] there are some days where I feel like
[00:09:22] reading this way and you know there's
[00:09:24] certain things that I'll listen to my
[00:09:25] audio books when I'm working out or when
[00:09:27] I go for runs that's my time with those
[00:09:28] audiobooks or even when I'm in the car
[00:09:31] you know as a passenger I'm reading the
[00:09:33] book that's on my ebook now the next tip
[00:09:43] is kind of a little work but I think it
[00:09:46] really helps kind of make the process of
[00:09:50] reading way more enjoyable and feel more
[00:09:53] permanent and that is to take notes and
[00:09:56] to keep track of parts of books or ideas
[00:09:59] and books that you like or quotes now
[00:10:01] there's tons of ways to do this I'm
[00:10:03] super simple I just do it in Google Doc
[00:10:05] I underline stuff it's an audiobook I
[00:10:07] can save the clip if it's an e-book I
[00:10:08] highlight it and there are apps to help
[00:10:11] kind of pile those together I think read
[00:10:14] wise is a good one just pay for that I
[00:10:17] just do it manually and what I'll do is
[00:10:19] when I'm finished with a book I'll go to
[00:10:21] my Google Doc and enter manually things
[00:10:24] that I earmarked for underline
[00:10:26] throughout the book things I remembered
[00:10:28] about the book I like to keep track of
[00:10:30] that and I feel like that makes the
[00:10:32] whole process of having read that books
[00:10:34] way more memorable and impactful and it
[00:10:37] just makes me want to read more got one
[00:10:39] more tip for you and then we're done
[00:10:44] [Music]
[00:10:48] so my last tip is this make a goal out
[00:10:52] of it set a certain amount of books that
[00:10:55] you'd like to read in a certain amount
[00:10:57] of time or even simpler than that
[00:10:59] say I'm gonna read this amount of
[00:11:01] minutes hours per day and stick to it
[00:11:04] start small even it's five minutes a day
[00:11:07] it's five minutes a day it's ten minutes
[00:11:09] it's ten minutes if it's an hour great
[00:11:11] it's an hour stick to that you know with
[00:11:13] anything as you start doing it day by
[00:11:16] day and it's something new and you're
[00:11:17] trying to make a habit out of it it
[00:11:18] doesn't feel too good
[00:11:19] feels like the challenge but as you
[00:11:21] start to remember the rewards of reading
[00:11:23] and you hit your goals there's some
[00:11:25] really deep satisfaction going on and it
[00:11:27] kind of fuels the future of your reading
[00:11:30] [Music]
[00:11:35] so those were my tips I hope that was
[00:11:38] super helpful they were helpful to me
[00:11:39] and over this past year I'm just really
[00:11:41] thankful that I was able to reconnect

=== Memorizing 31 Decks of Cards - Part 2 (RECALL) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPOcarxUMtA

[00:00:03] okay all right here we are
[00:00:34] [Music]
[00:00:37] okay so earlier today I memorize these
[00:00:41] 31 decks of cards and now I'm coming
[00:00:43] back here to recite them it's the fun
[00:00:47] part so let's do this so I think I'm
[00:00:53] gonna make some space in the middle so
[00:00:55] that I can show you the cards while I
[00:00:57] wears a blindfold trying to think what
[00:00:59] actually doing if I make errors I think
[00:01:01] if I make errors I'll try to correct
[00:01:04] them if I realize it if not I may put it
[00:01:07] to the side and then try to figure it
[00:01:09] out when I finished the rest of that
[00:01:11] deck okay
[00:01:12] so let me just move some of this to the
[00:01:16] side thank you guys for joining I have
[00:01:52] to say this but if you aren't please

[00:02:46] see try to see how many cards there are
[00:02:49] 31 times 52 sixteen hundred and twelve
[00:02:53] cards let's see my goal is always kind
[00:03:03] of like less than two percent error so
[00:03:07] it's about 30 cards I don't think I'll
[00:03:09] make them any mistakes but in case I do
[00:03:13] so be it all right so we're gonna start
[00:03:16] over here deck number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

[00:49:28] Diamonds ten of Hearts five of Hearts
[00:49:30] six of hearts
[00:49:33] three of diamonds eight of hearts five
[00:49:40] of clubs eight of clubs two of Spades
[00:49:43] four hearts five of Spades six of spades
[00:49:48] eight of Spades ace of clubs three now
[00:49:54] three of hearts two hearts nine of
[00:49:58] Spades Ace of Spades six of diamonds ten
[00:50:02] of spades
[00:50:11] let me put the next two down I'll come
[00:50:15] back to them and then the last four here
[00:50:17] are eight of diamonds sorry
[00:50:19] eight of diamonds two of diamonds nine
[00:50:24] of clubs and four of clubs right those
[00:50:31] were correct right yeah all right let me
[00:50:33] figure out these two give me a second I
[00:50:41] know one of them was the ten of diamonds
[00:50:43] I think it's not a dime is ten of
[00:50:58] diamonds I'm going to say that yes nice
[00:51:00] cool bit hairy but I got it alright last
[00:51:06] one of this row number 20 we're getting
[00:51:09] there
[00:51:16] now how many memory palaces do I have
[00:51:18] total and how do I decide which ones to
[00:51:20] use for what four cards this is pretty
[00:51:24] much all of them I may have a few other
[00:51:27] ones but maybe if we round them and
[00:51:33] let's see in total I hope they have over
[00:51:37] a hundred but I have some four numbers
[00:51:39] some forward some four random stuff
[00:51:41] stuff like that and then the other
[00:51:46] question is here have you ever tried to
[00:51:47] improve the PA oh yes and actually these
[00:51:50] next ten are using a different system
[00:51:52] which is basically instead of putting a
[00:51:55] person actual object three cards I do
[00:51:57] person action object but the first
[00:51:59] person is two parts we'll talk about
[00:52:02] that when we get them let me just finish
[00:52:03] this one and we'll start with that so
[00:52:07] this is deck number 20 yes okay nine of
[00:52:14] Hearts nine of clubs seven of clubs
[00:52:18] Queen of Hearts
[00:52:19] King of Diamonds King of Spades
[00:52:23] seven of Hearts four of Spades six of

[00:53:36] spades
[00:53:37] eight of Hearts three of diamonds and
[00:53:40] seven of Spades was okay yeah
[00:53:50] was it good all right
[00:54:00] so the next 10 that's nice okay is your
[00:54:08] mountain deck special have one down here
[00:54:10] that Scot figures the mountains I
[00:54:11] especially because when I was on an
[00:54:16] expedition or I'm guided a trip to
[00:54:19] Everest base camp and maybe Bob that for
[00:54:21] me as again so yes it is special but
[00:54:23] there's they look the same I mean I
[00:54:26] think it's each card has a picture of a
[00:54:27] different mountain
[00:54:29] alright deck number 21 so these I think
[00:54:32] we'll get recited a little slower just
[00:54:36] because it's kind of
[00:54:36] a newer thing for me and I make mistakes
[00:54:40] but let's let's let's let's see

[00:59:26] five of diamonds and ace of clubs how's
[00:59:33] that one yeah big question by Patrick
[00:59:43] asking how do I remember that worker of
[00:59:45] the memory palaces and that's a good
[00:59:47] question
[00:59:48] I don't really know it's just the order
[00:59:52] makes sense so it's it's usually an
[00:59:55] order of precedence like the preference
[00:59:58] the ones that I use more often that I
[01:00:01] like I start with and then just I kind
[01:00:04] of yeah it's kind of like a memory house
[01:00:06] with a memory palace but not very
[01:00:09] structured and just kind of vague these
[01:00:15] ones are all the last ten are all across
[01:00:17] New York City staring in my apartment I
[01:00:20] used to live in the lobby now here we're
[01:00:23] going to the gym across the street and
[01:00:24] then going to my girlfriends or current
[01:00:28] wife old apartment and so on how do I
[01:00:32] find enough loci it's a question there I
[01:00:34] just I create new ones if you need more
[01:00:38] memory palaces you think and come up
[01:00:40] with them so I had places that I used to
[01:00:43] live in places that I've been to places
[01:00:46] I've worked gyms you know parks outdoor
[01:00:50] places backyards so it you know you can
[01:00:53] break it up into whatever you know it is
[01:00:56] a place that you know alright so number
[01:00:58] 23 here we're an hour here okay I think
[01:01:03] we can finish this up in the next half
[01:01:04] hour that's great
[01:01:11] so have the gym here yes okay all right
[01:01:18] here we go

[01:03:35] yes Jeff so do I write a list for the
[01:03:37] memory palaces on paper I have them in a
[01:03:41] Google Doc somewhere you know well I'm
[01:03:43] creating them I say okay I need 17
[01:03:46] locations and I number them and I fill
[01:03:48] them out it's usually something I think
[01:03:51] of it makes sense to me it's a path
[01:03:53] through a place that makes sense so I
[01:03:55] don't need to memorize it but I like to
[01:03:56] keep it there for reference there are
[01:03:58] some memory palaces even some of the
[01:04:00] ones I'm using today I haven't used in a
[01:04:01] very long time so it was nice to
[01:04:03] reference them to remember but right now
[01:04:06] I don't have them written anywhere
[01:04:08] I just know them probably because I've
[01:04:10] spent so much time with them today right
[01:04:13] so 24 here
[01:04:17] this location is I think it's my my

[01:24:49] Spades nine of Spades three of diamonds
[01:24:55] nine of Hearts Ace of Diamonds two of
[01:25:00] clubs three of clubs four spades and ten
[01:25:07] of clubs right I think those were all

[01:25:13] missed moonwalking yeah okay there you
[01:25:19] go that's nice okay so let me see if I

[01:25:32] spades but let me just make sure it
[01:25:44] could be good now Jack of Diamonds find
[01:25:50] a space all right one wrong
[01:25:54] are you didn't see the majority sorry

[01:28:19] to say two hearts and ten of spades that

[01:28:30] ten of hearts king of clubs six of clubs

[01:29:46] their clothes all right all right last
[01:29:51] one let me redeem myself hopefully this
[01:29:54] is a perfect one and what we did all
[01:30:01] right
[01:30:01] queen of clubs five of clubs four of
[01:30:04] clubs two of Hearts King of Spades four
[01:30:08] of Hearts Ace of Diamonds five of Hearts
[01:30:11] Ace of Spades two of diamond six of
[01:30:14] Hearts 2 of Spades King of Diamonds Jack

[01:30:45] Queen of Hearts 3 of clubs 6 of diamonds
[01:30:50] 5 of diamonds 6 of clubs 9 of spades
[01:30:55] seven of clubs King of Hearts
[01:31:03] almost there 8 of clubs 7 of diamonds 5
[01:31:07] of Spades
[01:31:08] six of spades three of Hearts ten of
[01:31:13] Hearts 7 of hearts I said so I said that
[01:31:17] was 7 of spades this one 7 of spades 7
[01:31:20] of Hearts 3 of diamonds Ace of Hearts 3
[01:31:25] of spades
[01:31:26] 8 of Hearts
[01:31:29] and the last ones here four of spades
[01:31:32] queen of diamonds king of clubs and nine
[01:31:37] arts how was that two mistakes in that
[01:31:45] one someone says or you talk about the
[01:31:48] one before what was that one good all
[01:31:57] right
[01:31:58] uh that's okay that one was good great I
[01:32:04] think overall I probably may be made
[01:32:07] sore between ten and fifteen mistakes
[01:32:09] yeah you can probably go back over the
[01:32:11] video and figure that out
[01:32:13] I always make mistakes with things
[01:32:16] memorize okay all right let's let me
[01:32:20] just take an example maybe take the
[01:32:22] first deck just for examples sake so
[01:32:26] what I do and you can see this in a lot
[01:32:28] of other videos that I make basically I
[01:32:30] put three images of three cards into one
[01:32:34] image and I place it in my location so
[01:32:37] the first four or is it starting here
[01:32:40] they're the first three were a system
[01:32:44] hearts to Spain seven of clubs Ace of
[01:32:45] Hearts sorry ace of diamonds two of
[01:32:48] spades
[01:32:48] and seven of clubs right so me that's me
[01:32:53] thinking that I was the first one so I
[01:32:56] imagine myself the second card here two
[01:32:59] spades is the action of whoever that is
[01:33:01] that's Britney Spears but her actually
[01:33:03] is saying oops or dropping something
[01:33:05] like her song oops I did it again and
[01:33:08] that Miss thirty-one is Batman but as an
[01:33:11] object the third slot a new person
[01:33:14] action object so the object here is a
[01:33:18] bat so the image I have is me dropping
[01:33:23] or saying oops and dropping a bath and I
[01:33:26] places in the first location of my
[01:33:28] grandparents farm on the memory palace
[01:33:31] at the front door and then the next to
[01:33:33] was my sister sniping a white board in
[01:33:37] the kitchen which was Jack of Diamonds
[01:33:39] three of spades
[01:33:41] seven of spades then we go into the
[01:33:43] bathroom is an ex-girlfriend of mine
[01:33:45] ragging the horse inappropriately then
[01:33:51] it was my friend Mike outside of the
[01:33:53] bathroom spinning around a martini glass
[01:33:57] then we go into the bathroom there's a
[01:34:00] friend of mine she's on a TV like
[01:34:03] standing on top of the TV DJ like a
[01:34:05] record and so on now for thirty-one
[01:34:11] decks you if you saw my livestream this
[01:34:14] morning I spent two hours right and I
[01:34:17] even in between then and now I actually
[01:34:19] reviewed a little bit more too so
[01:34:21] because of the size of the how many
[01:34:23] decks there are I had to review quite a
[01:34:26] bit before I felt comfortable and even
[01:34:28] then it wasn't perfect right so I'm not
[01:34:32] perfect at this so that's that thank you
[01:34:37] guys for entertaining me and being here
[01:34:39] and your questions and watching and
[01:34:41] helping check if I got them right I
[01:34:44] wouldn't have done this without you know
[01:34:46] the community out there supporting my
[01:34:49] channel so thank you guys and this
[01:34:51] brings it close to the month of March
[01:34:53] for those of you that I don't know why I
[01:34:55] was doing 31 decks it's because every
[01:34:58] day of this month I memorized that many
[01:35:00] decks so March 1st I memorized one much
[01:35:03] second - March 10th 10 and then
[01:35:06] yesterday I did 30 the day before that I
[01:35:09] did 29 so today I did 31 yeah so
[01:35:14] tomorrow I'm not gonna memorize anything
[01:35:16] this is a really tough challenge it's
[01:35:19] called the calendar Club if you're
[01:35:21] interested in doing that with something
[01:35:23] that's not to be memorizing cards maybe
[01:35:24] you want to run miles or row meters or
[01:35:27] do something you know for me it was a
[01:35:30] way to get back into this and really
[01:35:32] stick to some kind of regimen every day
[01:35:36] of training my memory getting better at
[01:35:38] cards so anyways I promise you I'd show
[01:35:42] you my dog
[01:35:45] [Music]
[01:35:50] this is the snoring machine he's ready
[01:35:53] to go to bed anyways thank you guys so
[01:35:57] much for watching please subscribe if
[01:35:59] you haven't and thank you guys so much
[01:36:00] for spending time I promise like this
[01:36:03] then I will do a blind solve Rubik's
[01:36:06] Cube one day but I need to be faster so
[01:36:09] I got a practice and thank you guys if
[01:36:12] you want more watch my videos or you can
[01:36:15] find my book on Amazon
[01:36:18] I love these techniques in there I know

=== Memorizing 31 Decks of Cards - Part 2 (RECALL) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPOcarxUMtA

[00:00:03] okay all right here we are
[00:00:34] [Music]
[00:00:37] okay so earlier today I memorize these
[00:00:41] 31 decks of cards and now I'm coming
[00:00:43] back here to recite them it's the fun
[00:00:47] part so let's do this so I think I'm
[00:00:53] gonna make some space in the middle so
[00:00:55] that I can show you the cards while I
[00:00:57] wears a blindfold trying to think what
[00:00:59] actually doing if I make errors I think
[00:01:01] if I make errors I'll try to correct
[00:01:04] them if I realize it if not I may put it
[00:01:07] to the side and then try to figure it
[00:01:09] out when I finished the rest of that
[00:01:11] deck okay
[00:01:12] so let me just move some of this to the
[00:01:16] side thank you guys for joining I have
[00:01:52] to say this but if you aren't please
[00:01:54] subscribe to my channel I would love
[00:01:56] that

[00:02:19] let's just get started
[00:02:21] one second so what's the math here let's
[00:02:46] see try to see how many cards there are
[00:02:49] 31 times 52 sixteen hundred and twelve
[00:02:53] cards let's see my goal is always kind
[00:03:03] of like less than two percent error so
[00:03:07] it's about 30 cards I don't think I'll
[00:03:09] make them any mistakes but in case I do
[00:03:13] so be it all right so we're gonna start
[00:03:16] over here deck number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

[00:50:02] of spades
[00:50:11] let me put the next two down I'll come
[00:50:15] back to them and then the last four here
[00:50:17] are eight of diamonds sorry
[00:50:19] eight of diamonds two of diamonds nine
[00:50:24] of clubs and four of clubs right those
[00:50:31] were correct right yeah all right let me
[00:50:33] figure out these two give me a second I
[00:50:41] know one of them was the ten of diamonds
[00:50:43] I think it's not a dime is ten of
[00:50:58] diamonds I'm going to say that yes nice
[00:51:00] cool bit hairy but I got it alright last
[00:51:06] one of this row number 20 we're getting
[00:51:09] there
[00:51:16] now how many memory palaces do I have
[00:51:18] total and how do I decide which ones to
[00:51:20] use for what four cards this is pretty
[00:51:24] much all of them I may have a few other
[00:51:27] ones but maybe if we round them and
[00:51:33] let's see in total I hope they have over
[00:51:37] a hundred but I have some four numbers
[00:51:39] some forward some four random stuff
[00:51:41] stuff like that and then the other
[00:51:46] question is here have you ever tried to
[00:51:47] improve the PA oh yes and actually these
[00:51:50] next ten are using a different system
[00:51:52] which is basically instead of putting a
[00:51:55] person actual object three cards I do
[00:51:57] person action object but the first
[00:51:59] person is two parts we'll talk about
[00:52:02] that when we get them let me just finish
[00:52:03] this one and we'll start with that so
[00:52:07] this is deck number 20 yes okay nine of
[00:52:14] Hearts nine of clubs seven of clubs
[00:52:18] Queen of Hearts
[00:52:19] King of Diamonds King of Spades
[00:52:23] seven of Hearts four of Spades six of

[00:53:37] eight of Hearts three of diamonds and
[00:53:40] seven of Spades was okay yeah
[00:53:50] was it good all right
[00:54:00] so the next 10 that's nice okay is your
[00:54:08] mountain deck special have one down here
[00:54:10] that Scot figures the mountains I
[00:54:11] especially because when I was on an
[00:54:16] expedition or I'm guided a trip to
[00:54:19] Everest base camp and maybe Bob that for
[00:54:21] me as again so yes it is special but
[00:54:23] there's they look the same I mean I
[00:54:26] think it's each card has a picture of a
[00:54:27] different mountain
[00:54:29] alright deck number 21 so these I think
[00:54:32] we'll get recited a little slower just
[00:54:36] because it's kind of
[00:54:36] a newer thing for me and I make mistakes
[00:54:40] but let's let's let's let's see

[00:59:26] five of diamonds and ace of clubs how's
[00:59:33] that one yeah big question by Patrick
[00:59:43] asking how do I remember that worker of
[00:59:45] the memory palaces and that's a good
[00:59:47] question
[00:59:48] I don't really know it's just the order
[00:59:52] makes sense so it's it's usually an
[00:59:55] order of precedence like the preference
[00:59:58] the ones that I use more often that I
[01:00:01] like I start with and then just I kind
[01:00:04] of yeah it's kind of like a memory house
[01:00:06] with a memory palace but not very
[01:00:09] structured and just kind of vague these
[01:00:15] ones are all the last ten are all across
[01:00:17] New York City staring in my apartment I
[01:00:20] used to live in the lobby now here we're
[01:00:23] going to the gym across the street and
[01:00:24] then going to my girlfriends or current
[01:00:28] wife old apartment and so on how do I
[01:00:32] find enough loci it's a question there I
[01:00:34] just I create new ones if you need more
[01:00:38] memory palaces you think and come up
[01:00:40] with them so I had places that I used to
[01:00:43] live in places that I've been to places
[01:00:46] I've worked gyms you know parks outdoor
[01:00:50] places backyards so it you know you can
[01:00:53] break it up into whatever you know it is
[01:00:56] a place that you know alright so number
[01:00:58] 23 here we're an hour here okay I think
[01:01:03] we can finish this up in the next half
[01:01:04] hour that's great
[01:01:11] so have the gym here yes okay all right

[01:03:37] memory palaces on paper I have them in a
[01:03:41] Google Doc somewhere you know well I'm
[01:03:43] creating them I say okay I need 17
[01:03:46] locations and I number them and I fill
[01:03:48] them out it's usually something I think
[01:03:51] of it makes sense to me it's a path
[01:03:53] through a place that makes sense so I
[01:03:55] don't need to memorize it but I like to
[01:03:56] keep it there for reference there are
[01:03:58] some memory palaces even some of the
[01:04:00] ones I'm using today I haven't used in a
[01:04:01] very long time so it was nice to
[01:04:03] reference them to remember but right now
[01:04:06] I don't have them written anywhere
[01:04:08] I just know them probably because I've
[01:04:10] spent so much time with them today right
[01:04:13] so 24 here
[01:04:17] this location is I think it's my my

[01:21:44] I'm not going anywhere so I've at home I
[01:21:46] teach at the University locally not
[01:21:49] memory I teach computer science so I'm
[01:21:52] doing that remotely probably known
[01:21:56] blindfolded Rubik's solve right now I'm
[01:22:00] not very fast it takes me like six seven
[01:22:02] minutes with memorization but what I've
[01:22:07] been doing just been spending time with
[01:22:08] my family memorizing and working on my

[01:22:18] this going
[01:22:21] all right so this one okay nice I'm a
[01:22:28] computer science degree master as well
[01:22:32] okay here we go I got this first one
[01:22:40] here oh yeah okay five of diamonds three
[01:22:49] of spades
[01:22:50] king of clubs Ace of Spades six of

[01:28:19] to say two hearts and ten of spades that
[01:28:23] could be wrong
[01:28:24] queen of clubs nine of hearts
[01:28:30] ten of hearts king of clubs six of clubs
[01:28:37] three of spades nine of diamonds three
[01:28:42] of hearts Jack of Hearts ace of diamonds

[01:30:01] queen of clubs five of clubs four of
[01:30:04] clubs two of Hearts King of Spades four
[01:30:08] of Hearts Ace of Diamonds five of Hearts

[01:30:55] seven of clubs King of Hearts
[01:31:03] almost there 8 of clubs 7 of diamonds 5
[01:31:07] of Spades
[01:31:08] six of spades three of Hearts ten of
[01:31:13] Hearts 7 of hearts I said so I said that
[01:31:17] was 7 of spades this one 7 of spades 7
[01:31:20] of Hearts 3 of diamonds Ace of Hearts 3
[01:31:25] of spades
[01:31:26] 8 of Hearts
[01:31:29] and the last ones here four of spades
[01:31:32] queen of diamonds king of clubs and nine
[01:31:37] arts how was that two mistakes in that
[01:31:45] one someone says or you talk about the
[01:31:48] one before what was that one good all
[01:31:57] right
[01:31:58] uh that's okay that one was good great I
[01:32:04] think overall I probably may be made
[01:32:07] sore between ten and fifteen mistakes
[01:32:09] yeah you can probably go back over the
[01:32:11] video and figure that out
[01:32:13] I always make mistakes with things
[01:32:16] memorize okay all right let's let me
[01:32:20] just take an example maybe take the
[01:32:22] first deck just for examples sake so
[01:32:26] what I do and you can see this in a lot
[01:32:28] of other videos that I make basically I
[01:32:30] put three images of three cards into one
[01:32:34] image and I place it in my location so
[01:32:37] the first four or is it starting here
[01:32:40] they're the first three were a system
[01:32:44] hearts to Spain seven of clubs Ace of
[01:32:45] Hearts sorry ace of diamonds two of
[01:32:48] spades
[01:32:48] and seven of clubs right so me that's me
[01:32:53] thinking that I was the first one so I
[01:32:56] imagine myself the second card here two
[01:32:59] spades is the action of whoever that is
[01:33:01] that's Britney Spears but her actually
[01:33:03] is saying oops or dropping something
[01:33:05] like her song oops I did it again and
[01:33:08] that Miss thirty-one is Batman but as an
[01:33:11] object the third slot a new person
[01:33:14] action object so the object here is a
[01:33:18] bat so the image I have is me dropping
[01:33:23] or saying oops and dropping a bath and I
[01:33:26] places in the first location of my
[01:33:28] grandparents farm on the memory palace
[01:33:31] at the front door and then the next to
[01:33:33] was my sister sniping a white board in
[01:33:37] the kitchen which was Jack of Diamonds
[01:33:39] three of spades
[01:33:41] seven of spades then we go into the
[01:33:43] bathroom is an ex-girlfriend of mine
[01:33:45] ragging the horse inappropriately then
[01:33:51] it was my friend Mike outside of the
[01:33:53] bathroom spinning around a martini glass
[01:33:57] then we go into the bathroom there's a
[01:34:00] friend of mine she's on a TV like
[01:34:03] standing on top of the TV DJ like a
[01:34:05] record and so on now for thirty-one
[01:34:11] decks you if you saw my livestream this
[01:34:14] morning I spent two hours right and I
[01:34:17] even in between then and now I actually
[01:34:19] reviewed a little bit more too so
[01:34:21] because of the size of the how many
[01:34:23] decks there are I had to review quite a
[01:34:26] bit before I felt comfortable and even
[01:34:28] then it wasn't perfect right so I'm not
[01:34:32] perfect at this so that's that thank you
[01:34:37] guys for entertaining me and being here
[01:34:39] and your questions and watching and
[01:34:41] helping check if I got them right I
[01:34:44] wouldn't have done this without you know
[01:34:46] the community out there supporting my
[01:34:49] channel so thank you guys and this
[01:34:51] brings it close to the month of March
[01:34:53] for those of you that I don't know why I
[01:34:55] was doing 31 decks it's because every
[01:34:58] day of this month I memorized that many
[01:35:00] decks so March 1st I memorized one much
[01:35:03] second - March 10th 10 and then
[01:35:06] yesterday I did 30 the day before that I
[01:35:09] did 29 so today I did 31 yeah so
[01:35:14] tomorrow I'm not gonna memorize anything
[01:35:16] this is a really tough challenge it's
[01:35:19] called the calendar Club if you're
[01:35:21] interested in doing that with something
[01:35:23] that's not to be memorizing cards maybe
[01:35:24] you want to run miles or row meters or
[01:35:27] do something you know for me it was a
[01:35:30] way to get back into this and really
[01:35:32] stick to some kind of regimen every day
[01:35:36] of training my memory getting better at
[01:35:38] cards so anyways I promise you I'd show
[01:35:42] you my dog
[01:35:45] [Music]
[01:35:50] this is the snoring machine he's ready
[01:35:53] to go to bed anyways thank you guys so
[01:35:57] much for watching please subscribe if
[01:35:59] you haven't and thank you guys so much
[01:36:00] for spending time I promise like this
[01:36:03] then I will do a blind solve Rubik's
[01:36:06] Cube one day but I need to be faster so
[01:36:09] I got a practice and thank you guys if
[01:36:12] you want more watch my videos or you can
[01:36:15] find my book on Amazon
[01:36:18] I love these techniques in there I know
[01:36:22] I'll see you guys bye

=== BECOME A HUMAN CALENDAR in 15 MINUTES (calculate ANY day of ANY year) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ynxCeZGeFg

[00:00:00] Oh what's up guys today we are gonna
[00:00:03] talk about memorizing or calculating any
[00:00:07] day of the year
[00:00:09] well I know what you're thinking I've
[00:00:10] already done this video a few years back
[00:00:12] but I figured it needed an update since
[00:00:16] its 2020 and in that video I actually
[00:00:19] only covered hub from 2018 to 2019
[00:00:23] and I didn't really consider the future
[00:00:25] so that video is now outdated so I'm
[00:00:27] gonna redo it I'm basically going to
[00:00:29] give you the simple tools to just
[00:00:31] calculate this year and a few years from
[00:00:34] now further down in this video time
[00:00:36] stamp right here I'm gonna tell you how
[00:00:39] you can do this for absolutely any date
[00:00:43] in the history of mankind
[00:00:45] paths for the future enough of me
[00:00:48] talking let's get started all right
[00:01:03] first things first you're gonna need
[00:01:04] some kind of basic code to represent the
[00:01:07] day of the week all right it's very
[00:01:09] simple 0 is a Sunday 1 is a Monday 2 is
[00:01:12] a Tuesday 3s are Wednesday 4 is a
[00:01:14] Thursday 5 is a Friday 6 is a Saturday
[00:01:17] Sunday is kind of like the reset of the
[00:01:19] week which is why it's back to 0
[00:01:21] and then Monday 1 to Tuesday and so on
[00:01:25] it's pretty straight forward so what is
[00:01:26] the date made up of right we have the
[00:01:28] day of the month we have a month and we
[00:01:31] have a year those three things are gonna
[00:01:33] create some kind of numeric code and
[00:01:36] we're gonna basically add them all up
[00:01:37] divide them by 7 and then that will give
[00:01:40] us some number between 0 & 6 all you
[00:01:43] have to do is translate that back to the
[00:01:45] day of the week and that is the day of
[00:01:47] the week that whatever date you're
[00:01:48] trying to calculate falls on simple as
[00:01:50] that so let's start with the hardest
[00:01:53] part to memorize I think all right it's
[00:01:55] not that hard is the months there is a
[00:01:57] specific code I've calculated it there's
[00:02:00] different versions of this but this is
[00:02:02] the way I do it and there's a specific
[00:02:04] small number you got to remember for
[00:02:06] each month so I'm gonna walk you through
[00:02:08] this with a little mnemonic to help you
[00:02:09] remember
[00:02:11] January is the number five so just
[00:02:14] picture in January there's a ton of snow
[00:02:16] in winter five inches of snow January
[00:02:19] February is the number one and just
[00:02:22] remember that February is that one month
[00:02:24] that has the shortest amount of days
[00:02:26] just that one month March is also one
[00:02:29] think of one man marching just by
[00:02:32] himself all alone April is the number
[00:02:34] four it's the fourth month of the year
[00:02:36] or you can remember that April has that
[00:02:39] for our sound in it
[00:02:42] I guess May is the number six I just
[00:02:46] remember this by thinking maybe may be
[00:02:49] if I'm lucky I'll have some sex today
[00:02:52] sex six I'm saying next one is June the
[00:02:56] number is two and I always like to think
[00:02:58] that in June starts to become summery
[00:03:00] it's hot maybe it's too hot in June next
[00:03:04] one July is four that's an easy one I
[00:03:06] just think of July 4th ah
[00:03:08] August is a zero think of a gust of wind
[00:03:12] blowing through a hole and that hole is
[00:03:14] at zero September is 3 September is kind
[00:03:17] of the start of school year so I imagine
[00:03:20] the very first day of school maybe a
[00:03:22] three-year-old is going to its first day
[00:03:24] in his life of school October is 5 I
[00:03:32] like to think of somebody grabbing candy
[00:03:34] out of that Halloween trick-or-treat
[00:03:37] bucket with all 5 fingers to grab some
[00:03:39] candy November is the number 1 and you
[00:03:41] can remember that because November is
[00:03:43] kind of like the first the first kind of
[00:03:46] cold month at the end of the year right
[00:03:48] at the start of winter it's not really
[00:03:49] winter but let's just say the first cold
[00:03:51] month of that later part of the year and
[00:03:54] then finally December is 3 I like to
[00:03:56] think of Christmas and the three kings
[00:03:58] voilá one small exception on those month
[00:04:02] codes is if it's a leap year this year
[00:04:04] 2020 is a leap year and what you do on a
[00:04:07] leap here is for January or February you
[00:04:10] subtract one so instead of January being
[00:04:12] 5 it's actually for February 1 it's
[00:04:15] actually 0 I don't even bother thinking
[00:04:17] about that I just think if it's a leap
[00:04:18] year I just subtract 1 from my total at
[00:04:20] the end
[00:04:21] one quick thing how do you tell if a
[00:04:24] year is a leap year it's very simple the
[00:04:26] last two digits of the year if it's
[00:04:29] divisible by four it's a leap year so if
[00:04:31] you can have it twice
[00:04:33] basically Oh with one small exception if
[00:04:37] it's a centennial or a year that is like
[00:04:40] on a century like twenty one hundred or
[00:04:43] twenty huh 20 hundred two thousand
[00:04:46] sixteen hundred seven hundred that needs
[00:04:48] to be divisible by 400 in order for it
[00:04:51] to be a leap year let's get back into
[00:04:55] that alright so let's talk about the
[00:05:03] year code right so that's part of the
[00:05:05] equation so 2020 is actually gonna be
[00:05:08] the number five and I'm giving that to
[00:05:10] you because it's kind of tricky to
[00:05:12] calculate that'll be at the later part
[00:05:13] of this video but for those of you that
[00:05:15] just want the quick way to do this just
[00:05:17] know that this year is the number five
[00:05:19] and if you want to know the old years
[00:05:21] for 2019 2018 and I think even 2017 you
[00:05:25] can watch my old video here to see those
[00:05:27] codes for the future I'm gonna give you
[00:05:29] the next five years so you never have to
[00:05:31] see me make another one of these videos
[00:05:32] again 2021 next year is the number six
[00:05:36] then 2022 kind of goes back it's 0 2023
[00:05:40] is gonna be the number 1 2024 is the
[00:05:42] number 3 and 2025 is the number 4 all
[00:05:46] you have to do for this is just think of
[00:05:49] the actual number that is the code so if
[00:05:51] it's the 28th of a month then the code
[00:05:53] for the day of the month is 28 Wow now
[00:05:57] here's where something interesting comes
[00:05:59] in because at some point I said you got
[00:06:00] to divide by 7 we're gonna do something
[00:06:02] called modular division which basically
[00:06:04] means we're gonna divide by 7 but keep
[00:06:07] the remainder and now you can do this at
[00:06:09] any stage in the calculation you don't
[00:06:10] have to do at the end when you have a
[00:06:12] big total I like to do it at the
[00:06:13] beginning or in steps when the numbers
[00:06:15] quite small and I just keep kind of
[00:06:17] using the result from that to keep going
[00:06:19] with my son
[00:06:20] let's take today the day I'm filming
[00:06:22] this which is February 20th 2020 now I
[00:06:25] know for this year 2020 it's a 5 that's
[00:06:28] the code for the year
[00:06:29] alright so my tally my running tally is
[00:06:31] 5 I gotta
[00:06:32] then I typically add the month it's
[00:06:34] February what was the code for February
[00:06:36] it was a 1 so now I have 6 and then I
[00:06:40] add the day of the month which was 20
[00:06:42] what 6 plus 20 26 now remember it's a
[00:06:46] leap year so I subtract 1 I have 25 and
[00:06:50] now I do the dreaded part that's not
[00:06:52] that scary to modular division by 7 so I
[00:06:55] think to myself how many times does 7 go
[00:06:58] into 25 3 and what's left over the
[00:07:01] remainder of 4 so that's my resulting
[00:07:03] answer what is the day of the week for
[00:07:05] the number 4 it's Thursday baby let's do
[00:07:09] Christmas
[00:07:10] I don't know this year right December
[00:07:11] 25th 2020 so same thing for the year
[00:07:15] 2020 it's the number 5 December what was
[00:07:18] the code 3 3 Kings so right now I have 5
[00:07:21] plus 3 that's 8 now here because I went
[00:07:24] over 7 what I'll quickly do in my head
[00:07:26] is just basically say 8 is the same as 1
[00:07:29] because if I do modular division on 8
[00:07:31] how many times does 7 go into 8 it's 1
[00:07:34] with 1 left over so that's my code and I
[00:07:37] can actually drop that 7 and just keep
[00:07:39] the 1 and now add the day of the month
[00:07:41] which is 25 so 1 plus 25 is 26 it's a
[00:07:46] leap year but it's not January of
[00:07:48] February so I don't subtract 1 so I have
[00:07:50] 26 and now I say the same thing modular
[00:07:53] division 7 how many times the 7 go into
[00:07:55] 26 three times it's 21 and what's left
[00:07:58] over 5 Christmas is on a Friday this
[00:08:02] year ok so now you know how to calculate
[00:08:05] the day of the week for any point in
[00:08:07] time from roughly now to the next 5
[00:08:10] years and a little before but what if
[00:08:12] you want to know anything right what if
[00:08:14] you want to know you know 2050 your
[00:08:17] birthday what day that my hands on now
[00:08:19] the calculations a little tougher and
[00:08:21] basically what it hinges on the month of
[00:08:23] the day are the same you know those
[00:08:25] codes it's the year right I'm giving you
[00:08:27] the year codes but there is a way to
[00:08:28] calculate that it's a bit annoying but
[00:08:31] if you want to use some memory
[00:08:32] techniques you don't have all the videos
[00:08:34] I've ever made to help you do that
[00:08:36] you got to remember two more codes the
[00:08:39] first code is going to be for the
[00:08:40] century
[00:08:42] so the 1600s was a zero that's the
[00:08:45] century code and every four years it's
[00:08:48] zero so the 2000s are zero the twenty
[00:08:52] four hundreds will be a zero the twenty
[00:08:54] eight hundreds will be a zero as well so
[00:08:56] 1600 is 0 and then the 1700s is a five
[00:09:01] 1800s is a three the 1900s is a 1 and
[00:09:06] then the 2000s was a zero and then it
[00:09:09] repeats so you can figure that out
[00:09:10] pretty quickly so for you advanced folk
[00:09:17] you guys want to now calculate the year
[00:09:20] part so I gave you the code for the
[00:09:22] century right just the first two digits
[00:09:23] of the year that one was easy announce
[00:09:25] the two last digits of the year now that
[00:09:27] year could be anything between 0 0 and
[00:09:30] 99 that's a hundred different years a
[00:09:32] hundred different codes there is a way
[00:09:34] to calculate it but I find it annoying
[00:09:35] and cumbersome the best way for you to
[00:09:38] get fast at this is to just have them
[00:09:39] memorized I know that sounds like a lot
[00:09:41] but it's actually easier than you think
[00:09:43] all the codes can be are a number
[00:09:44] between 0 & 6 so 0 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 what I
[00:09:48] did and I calculated this for you and
[00:09:50] I'm gonna share the list you don't have
[00:09:52] to even bother just learn it I split up
[00:09:54] all the years that had 0 as the code all
[00:09:56] the years I had one is the code 2 3 4 5
[00:09:59] & 6 and then how did I memorize it well
[00:10:01] I had an image 4 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 you can
[00:10:05] do that any way you want maybe you have
[00:10:07] a major system if you don't know what
[00:10:09] that is check out my old video here or
[00:10:10] you may have a PA oh if you don't know
[00:10:13] what that is check this video out but
[00:10:15] basically it's some image that
[00:10:16] represents that number and what I did is
[00:10:19] for each of the years that was a
[00:10:22] two-digit number that had an image as
[00:10:24] well and I just associated those two
[00:10:26] images together for example in my system
[00:10:28] 0 you have a PA oh so I can use a few
[00:10:31] different things 0 is the action of
[00:10:33] sucking on something or it's a pair of
[00:10:36] vampire teeth okay and then for all of
[00:10:39] the different years I use the person
[00:10:40] doing that sucking or something related
[00:10:43] to teeth the first one has a zero is the
[00:10:46] year zero five which to me is Abe
[00:10:48] Lincoln
[00:10:49] Abe Lincoln so I have a image of my mind
[00:10:52] was just a blinking sucking on his hat
[00:10:54] big old Abe Lincoln hat another example
[00:10:57] is one and some of these I'm flexible
[00:11:00] with one seemed easy I just thought of
[00:11:02] something in the shape of a one and I
[00:11:03] tried to think of something related to
[00:11:06] the person of the year that had that
[00:11:08] shape a good example is seventeen that
[00:11:11] has the code one and my person for
[00:11:13] seventeen is Alex he's a pilot so I
[00:11:15] thought of the fuselage of the plane
[00:11:17] looks like a 173 is also code one it's
[00:11:21] Batman for me so I thought of that
[00:11:24] mobile right it's kind of shaped like a
[00:11:26] one it's just one directional the year
[00:11:29] zero three that's Jack Black for me and
[00:11:31] his code or that code for that year is
[00:11:34] for the action for that is actually a
[00:11:36] punching action I like actions they help
[00:11:39] me remember things better so I picture
[00:11:41] Jack Black just beating the hell out of
[00:11:42] anybody he's talking to while these may
[00:11:44] not make much sense to you I'm trying to
[00:11:46] explain how I went about memorizing it
[00:11:48] so use your own number system to just
[00:11:51] associate the year picture to that code
[00:11:54] picture got it yeah
[00:11:57] here is that list for your enjoyment you
[00:12:00] can also download it in the description
[00:12:02] if you want a full explanation of the
[00:12:04] whole step process whatever it is it's
[00:12:07] also in the description below and it's
[00:12:09] also mentioned in my book remember so
[00:12:11] what's the whole process at this point
[00:12:13] well okay if you're gonna do a full
[00:12:15] thing right you usually have the month
[00:12:16] day and year right so the month I'll
[00:12:18] come up with my code then the day I'll
[00:12:21] keep that as the code and I'm tallying
[00:12:24] up everything as I go but also dividing
[00:12:26] by seven keeping the remainder so by the
[00:12:28] time I get to month day I have a number
[00:12:30] nothing too big and then I add the code
[00:12:32] for the century pretty easy it's just
[00:12:33] zero one three or five and then I figure
[00:12:37] out my mnemonic I find the code for that
[00:12:39] specific two-digit year and then I add
[00:12:42] that to my total make sure I've been
[00:12:44] modded by seven and then I'm left with
[00:12:45] that one digit which is the day
[00:12:50] let's do a couple practice ones 1651
[00:12:56] January 31st think about it let's try
[00:13:57] another one
[00:13:57] what about in the future 2072 August
[00:14:05] 30th

[00:14:54] what was your birthday and you can
[00:14:55] calculate and say quickly with a bit of
[00:14:57] practice what day that week that fell on
[00:15:00] thanks for watching guys please like

[00:00:37] what's up guys Nelson Dellis here and it
[00:00:40] is pi day three one for March 14th and
[00:00:43] I'm at Miami's best pizza the best pizza
[00:00:46] in Miami I might say and I'm going to
[00:00:49] recite 1000 digits of Pi in order
[00:00:52] that's not enough that's not enough I'm
[00:00:54] also gonna be eating one slice of pizza
[00:00:57] pie for every minute it takes me to
[00:01:00] finish those thousand digits so here are
[00:01:02] the rules
[00:01:03] I'm going to start a timer try the
[00:01:05] finish reciting 1000 digits of pi as
[00:01:08] fast as possible but every minute it
[00:01:10] takes me I stopped the timer and I have
[00:01:13] to eat one slice of pizza pie when I
[00:01:16] finish that slice I start the timer
[00:01:17] again and continue reciting from where I
[00:01:20] left off previously so hopefully I can
[00:01:23] finish reciting those thousand digits
[00:01:24] before my stomach gets full let's go do
[00:01:29] this

[00:22:23] [ __ ] Sam there might be gaps here
[00:22:28] there but that's not because of any

[00:33:35] it's for pie
[00:33:43] one correction a few hundred numbers ago
[00:33:46] I said it was around zero five three
[00:33:49] nine two and then I said one seven one
[00:33:53] two two but it was actually supposed to
[00:33:55] be one seven one seven six realizing
[00:33:58] that now because one seven one two two
[00:34:00] is about to come up
[00:34:01] [Music]
[00:34:05] right
[00:34:10] I'll good

[00:34:45] eight nine time that's it anyways guys I
[00:34:54] hope you like that actually before I go
[00:34:58] maybe I should do a bit of it backwards
[00:35:00] just so just for ships let's go from the

=== MEMORY TRICK to STOP TOUCHING YOUR FACE (and to WASH YOUR HANDS more)! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_aYu2sPEJ8

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:04] start working I'm not touching your face
[00:00:07] because one main way viruses spread is
[00:00:11] when you touch your own mouth nose or
[00:00:14] eyes and of course advanced cleaning of
[00:00:16] surfaces every way she's come into the
[00:00:24] country noise just I think it's a very
[00:00:29] important thing working hard not to
[00:00:31] touch your face what's up guys my name's
[00:00:39] Nelson Delft I'm a four-time USA memory
[00:00:41] champion and I provide tips for you to
[00:00:44] help you remember better so amidst this
[00:00:46] coronavirus frenzy I have one amazing
[00:00:50] tip that'll help you remember to not
[00:00:53] touch your face and to wash your hands
[00:00:55] more all you need is a sharpie
[00:01:00] [Music]
[00:01:06] here it is this is what you do you take
[00:01:10] the sharpie
[00:01:10] you draw a circle on your hand on the
[00:01:15] inside a circle on the outside of your
[00:01:18] hand and do it on the other hand as well
[00:01:20] now I know this may sound a little
[00:01:21] extreme why you gonna draw dots on your
[00:01:23] hands but here's the thing a lot of the
[00:01:26] stuff we do when we touch her face it's
[00:01:28] involuntary it's just habit
[00:01:30] we do it we have an itch we do it
[00:01:31] because we're nervous or we're hiding
[00:01:33] something or it's just something we do
[00:01:35] or more uncomfortable why do this well
[00:01:37] it's supposed to be a deterrent or
[00:01:39] reminder every time you're about to
[00:01:40] raise your hand to your face whether
[00:01:41] it's backwards forwards this side that
[00:01:43] side that'll help you remember oh shoot
[00:01:46] I probably shouldn't touch my face right
[00:01:47] now now it's not perfect a lot of the
[00:01:49] times it may not even be looking at our
[00:01:50] hands when we do this but hopefully this
[00:01:52] will stop some of those occurrences from
[00:01:54] happening and the point of this is
[00:01:57] really you don't have a sharpie on the
[00:01:59] right hand for the rest of your life you
[00:02:00] want to be able to eventually break this
[00:02:03] habit or at least make it more of a
[00:02:05] thought before you do it and the main
[00:02:06] way to break a habit is to kind of
[00:02:08] introduce some kind of deterrent between
[00:02:11] you and that action that you're doing
[00:02:13] that's that block dog the other amazing
[00:02:15] thing about this black dot technique is
[00:02:17] that it's messy it's sharpie it's on
[00:02:19] your hand you want to wash it off so the
[00:02:22] goal is once you put that on your hands
[00:02:25] try to wash it off maybe immediately go
[00:02:28] wash it right it's not gonna go away
[00:02:29] because it's a sharpie so then maybe in
[00:02:31] half an hour you try to wash it again
[00:02:33] and not faded dot on your hands will
[00:02:35] remind you again to wash your hands more
[00:02:38] frequently eventually hopefully it goes
[00:02:40] away you can then reapply and start the
[00:02:43] process over again so it's just kind of
[00:02:45] getting in a routine of having something
[00:02:47] to block you from touching your face and
[00:02:49] then also to wash your hands to get that
[00:02:51] thing off so please don't touch your
[00:02:54] face and wash your hands if you like
[00:02:56] this video please share subscribe like
[00:02:59] the video comment what you think about
[00:03:00] this tip and if it helps you at all I'll
[00:03:02] see you in the next video

=== MEMORY EXPERT reacts to KEY AND PEELE MEMORY SKETCH ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozLnOomEa_8

[00:00:00] hey guys I'm Nelson Dellis I'm a
[00:00:01] four-time USA memory champion and I
[00:00:03] figured today we could react to a memory
[00:00:07] skit specifically a skit from Comedy
[00:00:10] Central's key and Peele show let's watch
[00:00:15] it alright so we have to remember h5
[00:00:19] alright so the premise is there in the
[00:00:22] garage and they have to remember where
[00:00:24] they parked in this case it's h5 we can
[00:00:27] all relate think of it every time you
[00:00:29] went to a sporting event or some massive
[00:00:31] garage and you have some letter some
[00:00:33] number some color some animals some food
[00:00:36] I don't know and you gotta remember it's
[00:00:38] the simplest thing you gotta remember
[00:00:40] but how often you come back to your car
[00:00:43] and you're just standing around can't
[00:00:45] remember where you put your car ok oh I
[00:00:50] got it high-five oh oh you're trying to
[00:00:52] do they're trying to figure out a
[00:00:53] mnemonic device ok so yeah so he starts
[00:00:58] off by saying high five
[00:00:59] is a great mnemonic and I probably would
[00:01:02] have sufficed you would probably want to
[00:01:04] associate that to something about the
[00:01:06] car because later on you might be like
[00:01:08] wait what was our mnemonic so you have
[00:01:10] to always the mnemonic is good if you
[00:01:12] got a hook into something maybe the car
[00:01:14] maybe something about what you're about
[00:01:16] to do or where they're about to go so
[00:01:18] they started off well yeah let's see
[00:01:20] what happens high fives came out in the
[00:01:23] 70s that's when they were invented
[00:01:24] that's a seven yeah there's two of us so
[00:01:26] so track two four seven that's five okay
[00:01:29] great so you got it so alright so now
[00:01:31] he's taking over and he's basically
[00:01:33] elaborating on that simple mnemonic
[00:01:35] high-five I see this before he's gonna
[00:01:37] go away the deep-end way overboard than
[00:01:40] it is necessary but it's friggin
[00:01:42] hilarious to watch and then there's five
[00:01:44] major small groups why are you going on
[00:01:46] oh you're gonna love this this is fun
[00:01:48] for me cuz it's a puzzle no no puzzle
[00:01:50] okay lives on five major food groups
[00:01:52] meat vegetables grain dairy and fruit my
[00:01:55] gonna throw his pineapple but you know
[00:01:57] that we gathered already shrine apple
[00:01:59] comes from Hawaii okay and oh my
[00:02:02] favorite current show is Hawaii five-o
[00:02:05] wife and right there it should have been
[00:02:07] good right I mean he's serving about
[00:02:09] five major food groups
[00:02:10] pineapple being a fruit pineapples
[00:02:12] coming from Hawaii Hawaii five-o right
[00:02:15] basically he did the same thing that
[00:02:18] Jordan did high five right so petty
[00:02:22] she's coming I love this y5o okay so
[00:02:24] yeah that's it done we're done
[00:02:25] - Scott Scott Caan is the soft Wi-Fi
[00:02:29] though we're really talking about Skye's
[00:02:31] father is James Caan who's one of the
[00:02:33] five major stars what's wrong the one of
[00:02:37] the five major huge stars right of the
[00:02:40] Godfather movies so it's Pacino Brando
[00:02:43] wife fall and
[00:02:46] thank you yes thank you and it's easy to
[00:02:49] remember her name but her name is the
[00:02:50] same last name as Worcester Kiki and
[00:02:52] Michael Kate no we're just going through
[00:02:53] some images and when you laugh just say
[00:02:56] ha stop stop stop stop
[00:03:00] so funny sometimes I will admit I get
[00:03:04] carried away and some of the mnemonics I
[00:03:05] come up with I need to make sense to me
[00:03:07] but to people around me my wife my
[00:03:09] family whatever they do tell me to stop
[00:03:11] I never go this crazy but it's kind of
[00:03:13] on point what I love about this team
[00:03:16] though if you notice is it's one tape so
[00:03:19] I would love to ask
[00:03:21] Keegan how he went about memorizing that
[00:03:24] or if it was made up on the spot
[00:03:26] it really feels improvised I will no you
[00:03:29] see what you're doing you're
[00:03:31] overcomplicating the whole thing we
[00:03:32] already had it you just you just you
[00:03:34] just make it more difficult just like
[00:03:36] you do everything I left my phone in the
[00:03:38] car pitch there we go wait hold up DAP
[00:03:43] no handshake no I got it see you forgot
[00:03:47] right he was thinking I mean obviously
[00:03:48] it's a skip but high five and confusing
[00:03:51] with DAP handshake right because you
[00:03:53] didn't hook it to some kind of thing
[00:03:56] related to where they were
[00:03:57] high five just thinking about it is it
[00:03:59] always enough and I know this is
[00:04:01] exaggerated but clearly it didn't work
[00:04:03] for him I got it I got a ha Buster
[00:04:07] Keaton and Michael Keaton say my name is
[00:04:08] Diane Cape is one of the five huge stars
[00:04:10] on the Godfather movies
[00:04:12] I said hatin Brando Duvall Pacino and
[00:04:15] James Caan Oh father Scott on the
[00:04:17] starboard bow Hawaii pineapple five
[00:04:22] major food fight or seven
[00:04:32] yeah and that's it but I mean clearly he
[00:04:35] had it memorized because he was able to
[00:04:37] recall all that or maybe not maybe he
[00:04:39] made up that on the spot and it worked
[00:04:41] so well because it was a good mnemonic
[00:04:43] I'll be it a roundabout mnemonic but it
[00:04:46] helped him get the line back and in the
[00:04:49] skip the car back anyways that was fun I
[00:04:53] loved watching that skin I wanted to
[00:04:55] share it with you guys in case you
[00:04:56] hadn't seen it and to see my reaction
[00:04:58] when I thought of it it's very well
[00:05:00] played by those guys and a funny story
[00:05:03] and kind of relevant to why I'm making
[00:05:04] this video is Maggio is releasing an
[00:05:06] episode of brain games that I feature in
[00:05:09] where Keegan is the host and last you
[00:05:12] might want to go film I met him and got
[00:05:15] to spend some time with him on set
[00:05:16] awesome guy hilarious however funny you
[00:05:20] think he is in these skits on TV in
[00:05:23] movies whatever he is not funny and just
[00:05:26] so witty and smart always cracking a
[00:05:28] joke it was really fun between takes we
[00:05:30] got to talk about memory a little bit
[00:05:31] funnily enough I asked him about this
[00:05:33] skit I said it's one of my favorites we
[00:05:35] could remember it which is crazy right
[00:05:38] how do you not remember your skin right
[00:05:41] I guess it's been a lot of skin so but
[00:05:43] anyways the show is great I would love
[00:05:45] for you guys to check it out here's a
[00:05:46] little taste of what it looks like and
[00:05:48] please tune in on NatGeo
[00:05:51] watch season 8 of brain games I believe
[00:05:54] this is episode six
[00:05:57] there's this unifying quality about the
[00:06:00] brain were all different types of people
[00:06:01] in all different places but the brain is
[00:06:04] what the brain is it makes us both
[00:06:06] unique and also universal so please
[00:06:16] check out that episode of brain games
[00:06:18] season 8 episode 6 I believe Mark Cuban
[00:06:22] is the guest and I'm not going to spoil
[00:06:25] it but you might say that I may be
[00:06:27] helped this billionaire with his memory

[00:00:07] you know buy fart yeah but in this video
[00:00:12] I'm going to teach you how to remember
[00:00:13] some really big prime numbers if you're
[00:00:16] a number D you're gonna love this
[00:00:18] let's get into it when I was a little
[00:00:32] kid I was obsessed with numbers oh I
[00:00:34] guess I still AM but I would try to
[00:00:37] figure out patterns in the prime numbers
[00:00:39] I couldn't and then later on when I got
[00:00:41] into my mathematics studies physics I
[00:00:43] convinced myself that I was going to
[00:00:46] prove and solve the Riemann hypothesis
[00:00:49] basically it's proving that prime
[00:00:50] numbers have a pattern it's one of the
[00:00:52] top mathematic problems that still needs
[00:00:54] to be solved to this day so I don't
[00:00:56] think I'm gonna get that but what I can
[00:00:58] do is memorize some really massive
[00:01:00] primes
[00:01:01] now why would you want to do this right
[00:01:02] who gives a flying Frick right well
[00:01:05] they're really easy to memorize so
[00:01:07] that's one and secondly if anybody ever
[00:01:09] asks you what is the largest prime
[00:01:11] number you know you now have an answer
[00:01:13] and you will be able to impress the
[00:01:15] parents of anybody else
[00:01:19] so our first number we're gonna start
[00:01:22] off small still big but small of the big
[00:01:24] and our first prime number we're gonna
[00:01:27] do some years it's not too big but still
[00:01:29] pretty big now the easiest one to
[00:01:31] remember
[00:01:33] 1999 and all you have to do is think
[00:01:36] about how Prince was just singing that
[00:01:40] song knowing it was a prime 1999 who's
[00:01:44] gonna party like that prime number was
[00:01:46] 1999 now on the topic of other prime
[00:01:50] years there are a few others the most
[00:01:52] recent is 2017 but were past that the
[00:01:56] next prime here is actually gonna be in
[00:01:58] ten years which is 2029 so in ten years
[00:02:05] time when it turns 2029 right at
[00:02:08] midnight when you're about to kiss your
[00:02:10] loved one the middle of a party middle
[00:02:12] of an event at home on your couch you're
[00:02:14] gonna stop you're gonna say 2029 it's a
[00:02:18] prime number alright next one we're
[00:02:22] gonna bump up those digits to five digit
[00:02:24] numbers there it is a five digit prime
[00:02:26] number the smallest American zip code
[00:02:30] that doesn't start with a zero one zero
[00:02:33] zero zero seven which happens to be the
[00:02:37] zip code of five the financial districts
[00:02:41] if you live in that zip code you live in
[00:02:43] a prime number zip code ten thousand and
[00:02:46] seven fun fact I'm sure all this stuff
[00:02:48] is really fun to you do you want it the
[00:02:50] largest possible zip code it actually is
[00:02:53] nine nine nine to nine Wrangell Alaska
[00:03:00] always wanted to visit there
[00:03:05] all right next up let's move along we
[00:03:07] are going to do the biggest prime time
[00:03:10] number no it is not the television or
[00:03:14] football time it is the largest time on
[00:03:17] your clock that reads as a prime that
[00:03:19] number actually happens to be 12 59 59
[00:03:24] every time you see that on the clock
[00:03:26] make sure to let your nearby friends
[00:03:28] know that it is a prime number and for
[00:03:34] all you Europeans out there that use the
[00:03:36] military time well it's 23:59 51 shame
[00:03:43] so 9 seconds before midnight remember to
[00:03:46] let that person know that that is also a
[00:03:48] prime you're welcome this next one is
[00:03:51] kind of it's it's kind of strange it's 3
[00:03:54] 7 900 9 number now you might be asking
[00:04:00] well Nelson that is actually not very
[00:04:02] memorable at all and I would say maybe
[00:04:06] you're looking at it wrong why don't you
[00:04:07] flip it around and you'll see that it
[00:04:09] actually is it's Google upside-down
[00:04:16] remember that game used to play when you
[00:04:18] were a smart little kid and you would
[00:04:19] write some numbers on your calculator
[00:04:22] flip it over and voila boobies yeah so
[00:04:26] now you can type Google and also be
[00:04:28] comforted by the fact that it is alright
[00:04:34] move it along let's do some phone
[00:04:36] numbers right so the 7 digit prime
[00:04:40] numbers if you were observant and
[00:04:42] watched a lot of Simpsons you might
[00:04:43] notice that there a phone number there
[00:04:45] home phone number at one point was
[00:04:46] written as 5 5 5
[00:04:49] Oh 1 1 3 whether that's a fluke or not I
[00:04:52] have no idea but the Simpsons phone
[00:04:54] number is this number and it happens to
[00:04:56] be prime now another phone number you're
[00:04:58] gonna love this one
[00:04:59] you're gonna love this one you know the
[00:05:00] song you could probably even say it with
[00:05:02] me 8 6 7-5 309 Jenny's phone number
[00:05:11] it is prime yeah here's a really easy
[00:05:17] one to memorize it's just six seven
[00:05:20] eight six seven nine six seven I like o
[00:05:25] six seven eight six seven nine six seven
[00:05:28] fun fact about this one it is actually
[00:05:30] the 4 millionth prime all right the next
[00:05:38] one here is the largest American phone
[00:05:41] number possible that's actually valid it
[00:05:44] goes like this one
[00:05:46] that's the country code nine eight nine
[00:05:50] that's the area code I don't know where
[00:05:52] that is nine nine nine nine nine nine
[00:05:57] seven it's pretty cool phone number that
[00:06:00] is your phone number
[00:06:01] I've never called it I don't know whose
[00:06:03] it is but maybe it's yours now we're
[00:06:08] really getting into the big stuff all
[00:06:09] right I love this one because even
[00:06:12] though it looks complicated it's
[00:06:13] actually super easy to remember and it
[00:06:15] is all ones and zeros it's 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
[00:06:20] 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 so the cool thing
[00:06:26] about this prime number is it's actually
[00:06:27] the largest known sequence of ones and
[00:06:30] zeros that increase like that right you
[00:06:32] have 1 1 and then 1 0 then you have two
[00:06:34] ones two zeros three ones three zeros
[00:06:37] four ones obviously four zeros wouldn't
[00:06:39] be a prime number but apparently that's
[00:06:41] the largest they found with that pattern
[00:06:45] alright this one's cool we're getting
[00:06:47] into a 17 digit prime number and this
[00:06:51] prime number is actually what's called a
[00:06:52] palindrome which means it reads one way
[00:06:55] the same as it reads backwards okay
[00:06:58] what's cool about this is 17 digit
[00:07:00] number it starts with a 17 because it's
[00:07:04] palindromic it's got to end with a 7 and
[00:07:07] a 1 so I write a 7 into 1 at the end
[00:07:10] that's 4 digits since it's a 17 digit
[00:07:12] number that means that there's 13 digits
[00:07:15] in between and guess what they are all
[00:07:17] zeros 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
[00:07:24] 17 fall by 13 zeros and in with a 71
[00:07:27] that is a 17 digit long prime number
[00:07:30] that's you alrighty this is the largest
[00:07:36] prime number known to be a mist pattern
[00:07:39] okay
[00:07:41] here it is 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9
[00:07:52] 10 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[00:08:01] check that out just counts up to 10 and
[00:08:04] then from 10 goes to a back down to 1
[00:08:06] that is a 22 digit prime number alright
[00:08:12] this next number is actually pretty cool
[00:08:13] I called the unlucky lucky prime number
[00:08:16] and it is basically a combination of 7s
[00:08:19] and 13s lucky 7 unlucky 13 and the
[00:08:22] amount of digits there are of each is
[00:08:24] reversed so there are 13 7s followed by
[00:08:28] 7 13s
[00:08:29] so seven seven seven seven seven seven
[00:08:34] seven seven seven seven seven seven
[00:08:40] seven seven 737s and then 7 13 s 1 2 3 4
[00:08:50] 5 6 7 the unluckiest luckiest balance
[00:08:56] Prime
[00:08:58] and the last most memorable largest
[00:09:04] crime that I could find is a 50 digit
[00:09:08] number this one is super easy because
[00:09:10] all it does is it counts from 25 up to
[00:09:13] 49 so - five - six - seven - eight -
[00:09:20] nine three zero three one believe us
[00:09:24] right 32 33 34 35 36 37 49 that my
[00:09:33] friends is the largest easiest prime
[00:09:37] number you could possibly imagine 50
[00:09:39] digits
[00:09:40] you are welcome thanks for watching guys
[00:09:47] I hope that was entertaining I hope that
[00:09:48] was at least enlightening I wasted a lot
[00:09:51] of paper but uh yeah next time anybody
[00:09:54] asks you what is the largest prime
[00:09:56] number you know just say hey hold my
[00:10:00] beer give me a massive roll of paper and
[00:10:04] I will write tons and tons of digits for
[00:10:07] you because I know my Prime's thanks for
[00:10:10] watching I'll see you in the next video
[00:10:12] maybe we can do more prime numbers
[00:10:13] another day alright I'll see ya I'm out
[00:10:17] alright bye

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:15] [Music]
[00:00:30] that'd be a sign at the end of
[00:00:36] the border the guy everyone else what's
[00:00:41] up guys Nelson Dellis Here I am
[00:00:45] Kilimanjaro National Park in Tanzania
[00:00:47] Africa running a guided trip but I
[00:00:52] figured I do video on how to make a
[00:00:56] memory last
[00:01:00] [Music]
[00:01:54] [Music]
[00:02:00] so there's this scene in the office
[00:02:02] things near the end of the series where
[00:02:06] Andy goes something like I wish there
[00:02:09] was a way to know you're in the good old
[00:02:11] days before you've actually left them
[00:02:14] sometimes some of our best memories are
[00:02:18] so fleeting right how do you make those
[00:02:21] more pronounced prolonged epic in your
[00:02:27] mind you can remember really all the
[00:02:30] details that go into what made that
[00:02:34] memory feel like the good old days so
[00:02:39] here we are I don't know what he camp to
[00:02:41] on Kilimanjaro my Shami roots this is my
[00:02:45] third time doing it and we've got a
[00:02:49] great big team of about 23 people I'm
[00:02:54] trying to really make a point to make
[00:02:57] this one as memorable as it can be so
[00:03:00] when I look back in it I'll be able to
[00:03:02] pinpoint it and make that memory really
[00:03:05] feel like something different special
[00:03:08] unique so how do you do that
[00:03:13] [Music]
[00:03:39] [Music]
[00:03:55] [Music]
[00:04:01] [Music]
[00:04:23] so to make your memories last one of the
[00:04:27] first things you got to do is to and I'm
[00:04:30] gonna borrow this from a friend of mine
[00:04:31] Jesse it's leur be where your feet are
[00:04:34] be where your feet are what does that
[00:04:38] mean basically wherever you are wherever
[00:04:40] your feet are be they're nowhere else
[00:04:43] don't think about other things don't
[00:04:46] imagine being somewhere else or
[00:04:47] reminisce about your past be there in
[00:04:50] that moment wherever your feet are
[00:04:53] that's where you are how do you do that
[00:04:55] well that means pay attention to what
[00:04:58] you're doing open up yourself to your
[00:05:00] senses in that moment what are you
[00:05:03] feeling what do you see
[00:05:04] what are you hear what do you say what
[00:05:06] are other people saying are you
[00:05:08] listening all those things need to be
[00:05:10] hyper aware of what's happening around
[00:05:12] you and just by kind of repeating that
[00:05:15] mantra to yourself be where your feet
[00:05:17] are if you can keep that in the back of
[00:05:19] your head you'll find yourself
[00:05:21] hypersensitive to all those things
[00:05:23] happening in that moment and when you
[00:05:25] think back on it that memory will feel
[00:05:28] alive and during that moment as you're
[00:05:32] experiencing it that memorable moment it
[00:05:35] will feel like it's lasting but it'll
[00:05:37] have some weight to it some importance
[00:05:39] some lasting this to it and that's the
[00:05:42] goal be where your feet are
[00:06:04] [Music]
[00:06:39] [Music]
[00:06:47] so I want you to try this exercise the
[00:06:52] question is this what are the three
[00:06:54] happiest moments of your life as simple
[00:06:58] as that now at first you hear that
[00:07:00] question and you say to yourself oh
[00:07:02] that's easy and then you think about it
[00:07:05] and you realize we'll wait what does
[00:07:09] that actually mean to me and so I've
[00:07:10] asked a bunch of people this question
[00:07:13] maybe hundreds at this point and it's
[00:07:16] funny we get into some very deep
[00:07:17] conversations I share mine or what I
[00:07:20] think are mine and they eventually get
[00:07:24] down to theirs and what's funny is that
[00:07:26] it all comes down to moments that you
[00:07:29] were the most present in and I guess the
[00:07:31] question came about to me in this moment
[00:07:33] where I felt exactly that we were on our
[00:07:37] way down from Everest 2013 I didn't get
[00:07:40] the summit I got to the first step which
[00:07:43] is about 8,500 meters above sea level
[00:07:46] and I got really cold and decided to
[00:07:48] come down very disappointed it was my
[00:07:51] second attempt and yet again I had
[00:07:53] failed I was with a great group of
[00:07:55] people we came down from the mountain
[00:07:57] and we were on the tibetan side so we
[00:07:59] had to drive across the border back into
[00:08:02] nepal i remember getting on the bus that
[00:08:05] was gonna take us back to Kathmandu and
[00:08:08] we had bought some beers in town and I
[00:08:12] just felt so alive I felt so present I
[00:08:15] can't explain it more than that we were
[00:08:17] on this bus I was surrounded by these
[00:08:20] folks that had climbed with for the last
[00:08:22] two months that I had experienced this
[00:08:24] an incredible life-changing climb with
[00:08:28] expedition with even one that I didn't
[00:08:30] define as successful it still meant so
[00:08:33] much and I was right there the warm
[00:08:36] thick oxygenated air was just you know
[00:08:38] coming through the open windows of our
[00:08:40] bus as I sipped on that beer and just
[00:08:43] looked around at all my buddies and I
[00:08:45] remember telling myself this is the
[00:08:47] moment this is the feeling I want to
[00:08:50] recreate as much as I can every day of
[00:08:53] my life and I've never forgotten that
[00:08:54] and later on as I try to figure out what
[00:08:57] that moment
[00:08:58] it was I was there nowhere else I
[00:09:03] couldn't of course I was thinking of my
[00:09:05] family who was gonna come home to that
[00:09:08] first burger I was gonna eat but I was
[00:09:11] there and that was it
[00:09:12] I felt the air in me and I was tingling
[00:09:16] it was it was the craziest most surreal
[00:09:18] experience of my life and I've never let
[00:09:22] go of that and I hope that kind of maybe
[00:09:25] made you shiver a little bit when you
[00:09:28] think about your own happiest memories
[00:09:30] and realize that those are the memories
[00:09:32] that last the ones where you were right
[00:09:35] they're the ones that equated to
[00:09:38] happiness oh man clouds just lifted Wow
[00:09:43] we're gonna be up there in less than 36
[00:09:47] hours I'll see you after the summit
[00:09:56] [Music]
[00:10:08] [Music]
[00:10:18] [Music]
[00:10:21] again
[00:10:25] [Music]
[00:10:43] [Music]
[00:10:52] hey guys
[00:10:53] [Music]
[00:10:55] but if you have all these positive
[00:10:57] voices in your head telling you you need
[00:11:00] to go on and all these things too
[00:11:03] because the Treasury yeah
[00:11:07] there was the most beautiful thing I've
[00:11:09] ever seen in my life never had the
[00:11:11] opportunity to percent above the clouds
[00:11:13] for government at the dead boy and when
[00:11:17] you make it to the top
[00:11:19] it all come down either you're crying or
[00:11:23] laughing jumping up and down
[00:11:25] I think that's feeling a joy really
[00:11:29] overwhelmed occur
[00:11:36] time is the most precious thing we
[00:11:39] probably have and I think we all know
[00:11:42] that think the funniest thing about it
[00:11:44] is that we know it yet probably the
[00:11:47] thing we waste the most so what I wanted
[00:11:49] to kind of mention is that I think we
[00:11:52] all have a really bad relationship with
[00:11:54] time meaning we don't really know how to
[00:11:58] let time pass longer when we want it to
[00:12:02] and when we can make time pass quicker
[00:12:04] when we want it to but basically time is
[00:12:06] relative right in times where you're
[00:12:11] having a great time usually it goes
[00:12:12] pretty quickly and when things are tough
[00:12:16] and difficult and boring usually tends
[00:12:20] to drag on right so what I'm saying is
[00:12:24] usually the moments that are really good
[00:12:26] the ones you want to remember gone like
[00:12:29] that right but what if you could extend
[00:12:31] that it's a hard thing to to grasp
[00:12:33] because know if something feels great
[00:12:36] you don't really notice the time right
[00:12:37] but what I've been saying before be
[00:12:40] present be where your feet are all those
[00:12:43] things you're really in the moment
[00:12:44] you're trying to stretch out everything
[00:12:46] that you experience within that moment
[00:12:48] and hopefully make that moment last just
[00:12:51] a little bit more and in the process
[00:12:54] make it more memorable when you think
[00:12:55] back on it so one little exercise I
[00:12:57] think that might be helpful for a lot of
[00:13:00] you out there not just for the purpose
[00:13:01] of this video but for the future of your
[00:13:04] relationship with time is when you're in
[00:13:06] a moment where you know somebody's gonna
[00:13:09] be boring and long right what do you do
[00:13:11] take out your phone play some candy
[00:13:14] crush text a friend look up video
[00:13:17] whatever don't do that be bored learn
[00:13:21] how to experience a kind of boring
[00:13:24] amount of time by yourself with your
[00:13:27] thoughts see what that does for you I
[00:13:30] feel like that will help you remember
[00:13:34] moments better and have them last a
[00:13:37] little longer if that makes any sense

=== My Journey Learning Dutch (year 1) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKkQSIbtItQ

[00:00:00] hello so hard to think really yeah
[00:00:08] testing testing that was me just a few
[00:00:21] weeks ago yeah after a year of learning
[00:00:24] Dutch still having some problems this is
[00:00:28] also me all they bought this in a
[00:00:30] pittsburgh-based
[00:00:31] happy em piss pot vomit pot piss piss
[00:00:33] sometimes when I feel like I've got this
[00:00:36] line which under wraps and that's pretty
[00:00:38] much how I felt on this one year journey
[00:00:41] of learning Dutch slash punish at times
[00:00:44] I felt overjoyed with the progress I've
[00:00:47] made other times I felt really
[00:00:49] frustrated that I plateaued that I don't
[00:00:52] know anything at all when in fact I know
[00:00:54] that I do but what I was come to realize
[00:00:58] is that this is part of the language
[00:00:59] learning process I'm gonna encounter
[00:01:01] those kinds of things so this video is
[00:01:03] gonna talk about my journey from January
[00:01:06] 1st 2019 to 2020 January 1st my one-year
[00:01:10] journey to learning Dutch to becoming
[00:01:14] conversationally fluent
[00:01:17] [Music]
[00:01:27] alright first let's take a step back
[00:01:29] about a year ago when I started getting
[00:01:32] ideas for this project I was approached
[00:01:34] by a company called drops they are a
[00:01:37] language learning app that basically
[00:01:41] makes learning languages fun and there's
[00:01:45] dozens and dozens of different languages
[00:01:47] there's a really attractive UI so it's
[00:01:49] fun to play and you don't have to commit
[00:01:52] too much to it it's just kind of this
[00:01:53] thing that you can play five minutes a
[00:01:55] day and learn some vocabulary in a
[00:01:57] target language so we have an idea to
[00:02:00] see if I could learn as memory champion
[00:02:02] all of their words in their database
[00:02:05] which was about 2,000 to 2,500 words in
[00:02:08] the target language of my choice now I
[00:02:10] chose Dutch not the most common language
[00:02:12] to choose because it's it's part of my
[00:02:15] family it's part of my roots my mother
[00:02:16] speaks Flemish which is a sort of
[00:02:19] dialect of Dutch the Dutch or Flemish
[00:02:21] will kill me for saying that but
[00:02:23] essentially the same written language
[00:02:25] pronounced a little differently
[00:02:26] different idioms different expressions
[00:02:28] of course but more or less very similar
[00:02:31] language so if you look at some of my
[00:02:33] older videos you'll see me accomplishing
[00:02:35] this feat getting tested by my mother it
[00:02:38] was a really great experience and a good
[00:02:40] challenge for my memory because I can
[00:02:42] memorize a lot really quickly but in a
[00:02:44] foreign language and that many words
[00:02:46] over time to really know them you know
[00:02:49] deep inside my brain so I can recall
[00:02:51] them when I need them that's not the
[00:02:53] simplest of tasks even for a memory
[00:02:55] champion but I was able to do it in
[00:02:57] ninety days I was able to memorize all
[00:03:00] 2500 or so words but it didn't stop
[00:03:03] there of course I wanted to become
[00:03:05] conversational in this language and
[00:03:07] knowing 2,000 words no matter how many
[00:03:09] words you know you won't be able to
[00:03:11] converse with anybody holmen's I mess Oh
[00:03:17] scuba-dive mess part of this journey
[00:03:21] really was to get closer to my mother
[00:03:24] and her side of the family for 35 years
[00:03:26] of my life she spoken that language to
[00:03:29] her sisters on the phone we've been to
[00:03:31] Belgium many times but I never picked up
[00:03:34] the language we also spoke French at the
[00:03:36] household my father's French so that's
[00:03:37] the language I actually grew up on a lot
[00:03:39] of people out they were asking me well
[00:03:41] your parents suck
[00:03:42] they weren't teaching you any languages
[00:03:44] but that's not true they were teaching
[00:03:45] me French so what's the ninety days were
[00:03:46] done we kind of have this face to idea
[00:03:48] between drops and I and that was to
[00:03:50] continue learning but now with study and
[00:03:54] with practicing and all the things that
[00:03:57] might go into your typical language
[00:03:58] learning process they team me up with a
[00:04:00] platform called prep lis and basically
[00:04:03] it's an online platform where you can
[00:04:04] choose your tutors and hire them and do
[00:04:07] sessions online I found a great tutor
[00:04:09] her name was Karina she was actually
[00:04:12] Flemish but spoke Dutch spoke Greek
[00:04:14] spoke Portuguese spoke dozens of
[00:04:17] languages crazy so since about April
[00:04:19] till about late November I was taking
[00:04:22] lessons with her sometimes once a week
[00:04:24] most times twice a week sometimes you've
[00:04:26] been three times a week and I've been
[00:04:28] studying through her speaking with her
[00:04:31] listening to her of course I've been
[00:04:34] dozens of other things reading articles
[00:04:36] news books children's books oh mama mama
[00:04:44] mama hey close the oven
[00:04:47] listening to podcast listening to kids
[00:04:49] cartoons watching the Pete's cartoons
[00:04:51] anyways here we are
[00:04:53] December end of the year where am i how
[00:04:56] am i doing what's in store for me so one
[00:04:58] of the ideas we had was at the end of
[00:04:59] the year we were gonna send me and my
[00:05:01] mother to Belgium where her family is
[00:05:03] and see how I do can I understand my
[00:05:06] family can I talk with them what would
[00:05:08] happen would I feel closer to that side
[00:05:10] of my family or would it feel as bizarre
[00:05:12] and not a part of me as it used to so my
[00:05:15] mom and I went to Belgium a couple weeks
[00:05:17] ago and here is what that trip looked
[00:05:19] like
[00:05:21] since it back on but Netherlands the
[00:05:25] letter was a near on Familia the bazooka
[00:05:27] the akin yaran Lechmere have cuisine to
[00:05:31] spray gimme so good angles this is our
[00:05:34] heads and hood opening then who hood
[00:05:38] main netherlands is when you clawed even
[00:05:42] glass
[00:05:43] [Music]
[00:06:09] jeez
[00:06:17] [Music]
[00:06:24] [Music]
[00:06:47] [Music]
[00:07:06] I loved seeing that it just makes me
[00:07:13] feel I don't even know the words it's an
[00:07:19] interesting thing and this is kind of
[00:07:21] what I wanted to talk about as the New
[00:07:23] Year rolls around you know learning a
[00:07:26] language people have all sorts of
[00:07:28] reasons for doing that whether you've
[00:07:30] just moved and you need to know it for
[00:07:33] work or you just want to be able to
[00:07:36] speak another language to impress your
[00:07:38] friends or someone or a girlfriend or
[00:07:40] maybe like me where you have family from
[00:07:43] that place and you want to not only be
[00:07:46] able to speak with them but to really
[00:07:49] connect with them and at the beginning I
[00:07:52] really thought it was just about
[00:07:53] speaking and understanding them that's
[00:07:55] it but as I sat there with my family
[00:07:59] some of who I'd never met yet my
[00:08:03] cousin's kids who hadn't seen I hadn't
[00:08:05] seen him in 20 years or so I just
[00:08:08] couldn't believe that there I was a part
[00:08:10] of this family the side of the family
[00:08:12] which had never really felt like a part
[00:08:14] of me and I understood them and I was
[00:08:18] laughing with them and we reminisced
[00:08:20] about memories that we had together and
[00:08:22] you know I was able to feel that it was
[00:08:25] crazy it was a surreal experience and I
[00:08:27] just stepped back out of myself and I
[00:08:29] just couldn't believe that learning the
[00:08:31] language could bring all that to me and
[00:08:33] I'm not fluent by any means but it
[00:08:37] really felt like there was something
[00:08:38] fluent in me at that point and that
[00:08:42] really hit it home for me that
[00:08:44] everything I'd worked for this year
[00:08:47] granted I'm not perfect in my language
[00:08:50] learning and what I've learned I could
[00:08:52] maybe learn more but I was I felt really
[00:08:56] successful I felt really proud of myself
[00:08:58] for coming that far and putting myself
[00:09:01] in that situation so what's next
[00:09:03] am I done with Dutch not at all right
[00:09:05] I've made quite a bit of progress in the
[00:09:08] past year but my journey to full fluency
[00:09:11] is nowhere near done
[00:09:12] it's gonna be something I'm gonna
[00:09:13] continue working on throughout this year
[00:09:15] and the next and so on you'll see some
[00:09:18] more videos of me talking with my mom so
[00:09:19] you can see some awesome improvements as
[00:09:23] they happen I have some ideas for
[00:09:25] enrolling myself into different Dutch /
[00:09:27] Flemish courses continuing with my tutor
[00:09:30] online on prep lis and every once in a
[00:09:33] while getting through my drops apps
[00:09:34] words to keep those words fresh so going
[00:09:36] to the new year I hope that this video
[00:09:38] inspires you to get started on your own
[00:09:41] language learning journey it doesn't
[00:09:43] have to be through drops or prep Li but
[00:09:47] really finding that why to why you would
[00:09:49] like to learn a language and to really
[00:09:52] committing to it that's one thing I did
[00:09:54] this year is every day I put a little
[00:09:56] bit of work into it even when I didn't
[00:09:58] feel like it I did it and it paid off
[00:10:01] yeah there were some days where I felt
[00:10:02] like what I was doing it wasn't helping
[00:10:04] at all but when I was sitting there with
[00:10:06] my family at the end of it all it really
[00:10:09] felt like it came through thank you guys
[00:10:11] so much for following me this last year
[00:10:13] for enjoying some of my videos I got a
[00:10:15] lot of new subscribers especially from
[00:10:17] the Netherlands Thank You Val if you

[00:10:27] to the mind and memory then subscribe
[00:10:31] please I would make my day I love you
[00:10:34] all this year has been amazing it's

[00:10:40] me
[00:10:40] and I will see you in the next video as
[00:10:42] I like to say I'm out

=== READ A BOOK IN A DAY (how to speed-read and remember it all) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q0we4LjSws

[00:00:12] four years ago I entered myself into a
[00:00:15] speed-reading competition just for the
[00:00:18] heck of it and I actually did really
[00:00:20] well I came in third place really
[00:00:24] unexpected and I didn't even train for
[00:00:27] it or do any special preparation nothing
[00:00:30] really nothing I applied a few
[00:00:34] techniques I had read about beforehand
[00:00:36] mixed with my natural ability to be
[00:00:38] attentive and my trained memory to
[00:00:41] actually just perform well and that's
[00:00:43] really all I did I was competing against
[00:00:47] these guys that were claiming to have
[00:00:49] over 2,000 words per minute speed
[00:00:51] reading abilities it was insane and
[00:00:53] slightly unbelievable and those guys
[00:00:55] actually bombed and crashed now there's
[00:00:57] a lot of [ __ ] out there about speed
[00:00:59] reading and programs that can promise to
[00:01:01] increase your speed by 2,000 percent or
[00:01:04] something crazy
[00:01:05] the shorter that speed reading doesn't
[00:01:06] just come down to one number how fast
[00:01:09] you can rate it really depends on where
[00:01:11] you are what you're reading what you
[00:01:13] want out of the book right
[00:01:15] all those little factors play into how
[00:01:18] fast you're gonna read a book and what
[00:01:19] you're gonna retain anyways the point of
[00:01:21] this video is to show you that anybody
[00:01:23] including you can actually read a book
[00:01:26] in a day I've actually never tried this
[00:01:28] so I'm going to try it today and then at
[00:01:31] the end of this video I'm going to share
[00:01:32] some tips with you on how you can do it
[00:01:34] too
[00:01:34] so the next thing you need to do is find
[00:01:36] a book that I want to read in a day
[00:01:38] let's do this
[00:01:40] [Music]
[00:01:51] so after spending some time walking
[00:01:54] around the city thinking about what that
[00:01:56] book was going to be we ended up in the
[00:01:59] strand bookstore off of Union Square
[00:02:01] where I spent about an hour looking for
[00:02:03] the right one I didn't want to be too
[00:02:05] easy I didn't want to be too hard they
[00:02:07] want to be too long too short just right
[00:02:09] so I decided on this book The Handmaid's
[00:02:12] Tale I know a little bit about it I
[00:02:14] haven't read it I've seen a little bit
[00:02:16] of the show but I've heard it's really
[00:02:18] good it's not too long it's about 300
[00:02:20] pages the font isn't too big or small
[00:02:25] seems just right so we're heading on the
[00:02:28] train back upstate in a few hours it's
[00:02:31] about three hours long the whole ride so
[00:02:33] I'm hoping to try to read the book start
[00:02:35] to finish on that train ride at the end
[00:02:37] I'll give you tips on how I did that and
[00:02:40] how you can do it as well
[00:02:44] [Music]
[00:03:32] [Music]
[00:04:01] well last night on the train ride home
[00:04:04] actually didn't finish the book but I
[00:04:07] got pretty close I did about two hundred
[00:04:09] and thirty four pages I did exactly 234
[00:04:13] pages out of 295 it was a three-hour
[00:04:16] ten-minute train ride that's not too bad
[00:04:19] so I took a break we got home and then a
[00:04:23] little bit later I finished up the book
[00:04:25] there's another 60 pages or so and it
[00:04:27] took me about 44 minutes so all in all I
[00:04:31] read this book about 300 pages in 3
[00:04:34] hours and 50 minutes or so not too bad
[00:04:38] so I did a bit of math there's a hundred
[00:04:41] and five thousand words in this
[00:04:42] particular book more or less and the
[00:04:45] average speed reading rate is about 200
[00:04:48] to 250 words per minute so if you wanted
[00:04:52] to at that speed which isn't that fast
[00:04:54] you could finish this book in seven
[00:04:57] hours turns out that for me the speed I
[00:04:59] was reading at with a few techniques I'm
[00:05:01] about to show you in a little bit I was
[00:05:02] able to read about 450 words per minute
[00:05:05] which is blazing fast either but it's
[00:05:08] actually only about 1% of the population
[00:05:10] reads at that speed so it is faster than
[00:05:13] average and it led me to finish the book
[00:05:16] in under 4 hours which is more of a
[00:05:18] reasonable time to finish a book in a
[00:05:20] day alright so here's the deal I'm gonna
[00:05:23] give you 10 tips to help increase your
[00:05:26] speed reading ability now not only that
[00:05:28] I just don't want to promise you can
[00:05:30] speed read thousands words per minute I
[00:05:33] want you to be able to read faster but
[00:05:34] also remember what you friggin read
[00:05:37] that's the thing that really grinds my
[00:05:38] gears is people promise all these
[00:05:40] abilities to speed read promised to
[00:05:43] increase your reading ability by tenfold
[00:05:46] thousand words per minute all this crazy
[00:05:48] stuff and that's fine maybe it's doable
[00:05:50] but are you gonna remember what you read
[00:05:52] I want you to be able to read faster
[00:05:54] enjoyably and to remember the [ __ ] you
[00:05:58] read it's not too much to ask
[00:06:01] [Music]
[00:06:03] all right so tip number one intent you
[00:06:08] gotta want to do this right I'm not
[00:06:10] forcing you to read any books but if you
[00:06:13] do want to then just do it just do it
[00:06:17] seriously just do it I wanted to read a
[00:06:20] book in a day I said tomorrow on the
[00:06:22] train ride home I have three hours
[00:06:23] allotted to sit down do whatever I want
[00:06:25] I'm gonna dedicate that to reading a
[00:06:27] book
[00:06:28] now obviously you have so many hours in
[00:06:30] a day if I'm telling you you can read a
[00:06:32] book like this in four hours if you
[00:06:34] learn how to read a little bit quicker
[00:06:35] that's still four hours of your day
[00:06:37] right where are you getting four hours
[00:06:39] from well you can make time for that
[00:06:42] right think about it's really only eight
[00:06:43] thirty minute blocks if you really
[00:06:45] wanted to and this is what it comes down
[00:06:47] to you could not look at your phone
[00:06:50] you could not swipe through Instagram or
[00:06:52] post on Facebook or whatever that's
[00:06:55] probably gonna save you those four hours
[00:06:57] in a day make sure that you also choose
[00:06:59] a book that you're interested in don't
[00:07:00] make it something that you're forcing
[00:07:02] yourself to read and then also ask
[00:07:03] yourself the question why am i doing
[00:07:05] this if you don't have an answer then
[00:07:08] maybe you shouldn't do it find that
[00:07:09] reason to kind of build into your intent
[00:07:11] so that it makes the process of reading
[00:07:13] this book a lot more enjoyable and
[00:07:15] you're naturally gonna be reading it a
[00:07:17] little bit faster because you're
[00:07:18] devouring it because of that reason that
[00:07:20] makes you want to do it okay that's
[00:07:22] enough of that
[00:07:26] alright it goes without saying that tip
[00:07:28] number two or step number two is to turn
[00:07:30] off any distractions right so it's very
[00:07:33] easy to get distracted obviously in this
[00:07:34] day and age so anything that you think
[00:07:37] will distract you from keeping focused
[00:07:39] on your book turn it off put it away get
[00:07:42] it out of sight for me on my train ride
[00:07:44] I turned my phone on silent I actually
[00:07:46] turned it off and put it in my back
[00:07:48] pocket was not gonna be a problem
[00:07:51] it was not gonna distract me one goal in
[00:07:53] mind I was gonna do it yeah
[00:07:56] [Music]
[00:07:59] alright so the next tip is to work on
[00:08:02] increasing your peripheral vision so if
[00:08:05] you think about it when you read you
[00:08:08] know obviously you're reading a line
[00:08:09] it's very tempting to think that you
[00:08:11] read from the left side of the page to
[00:08:13] the right side of the page literally
[00:08:15] from end to end but we don't actually do
[00:08:17] that our eyes jump around and we
[00:08:19] actually can see things that are not
[00:08:21] directly in our slide of sight if you
[00:08:23] look directly at my finger you can
[00:08:25] actually see what's here and here maybe
[00:08:27] not perfectly but you can get the sense
[00:08:29] of it and if we can do that when we read
[00:08:31] you're gonna cut out words that you
[00:08:33] actually need to look at in process and
[00:08:35] that's obviously gonna cut down on your
[00:08:37] reading time because there's less words
[00:08:39] you need to read so a tip to do that I
[00:08:41] didn't come up with this but I've seen
[00:08:42] this in numerous places start with the
[00:08:45] first few pages take a ruler and draw a
[00:08:50] line a vertical line on either sides of
[00:08:53] the margin about one or two words in
[00:08:56] okay see that and then what you're gonna
[00:08:58] try to do is read for a few pages maybe
[00:09:00] for five to six pages by only reading in
[00:09:04] between those margins okay so
[00:09:06] technically I'm cutting out two to three
[00:09:09] words on either side and focusing only
[00:09:12] on the middle part not to say that
[00:09:13] you're ignoring those words you can
[00:09:15] still read them but you don't have to
[00:09:16] actually read them and what you'll find
[00:09:18] is after a few pages you don't have to
[00:09:21] do that for every single page but you'll
[00:09:23] naturally find yourself just limiting
[00:09:24] yourself to that specific range you can
[00:09:27] even narrow that range to and get better
[00:09:29] at literally looking at a very small
[00:09:32] portion of the page sounds crazy but it
[00:09:35] actually works
[00:09:39] all right next tip is to eliminate going
[00:09:43] back so when I used to read or sometimes
[00:09:47] when I do when I'm really tired I'll
[00:09:48] read something but I find myself going
[00:09:50] back to that same line or even in that
[00:09:52] same paragraph because my eyes are all
[00:09:54] over the place that is wasting time and
[00:09:56] I'm not gonna get through this book as
[00:09:57] fast as I want if I keep on doing that
[00:09:59] so you want to eliminate as much as you
[00:10:02] can any backtracking that means your
[00:10:04] eyes need to be focused on what you're
[00:10:06] looking for and constantly progressing
[00:10:07] moving forward in the book no going back
[00:10:10] no going back so one technique that I
[00:10:12] used to do that is basically pointing
[00:10:14] take my index finger you can use a pen
[00:10:17] or any kind of sharp singular device
[00:10:22] fingers good and literally I just guide
[00:10:26] myself along with in that little range
[00:10:29] that we talked about in the previous tip
[00:10:30] and I make myself follow the line down
[00:10:33] the page no going back now it takes a
[00:10:36] bit of getting used to
[00:10:37] it's a bit weird to stand there pointing
[00:10:39] at your book but you get the hang of it
[00:10:41] and actually you rely on that finger to
[00:10:44] guide you through the book and this can
[00:10:46] almost dictate how fast you're pushing
[00:10:48] yourself at first it's gonna be not so
[00:10:50] fast with practice as you get through
[00:10:52] the book you're gonna find yourself just
[00:10:54] kind of zipping through the page it
[00:10:55] looks kind of ridiculous if anybody's
[00:10:57] watching you doing that don't think
[00:10:58] you're not even reading you actually can
[00:11:00] follow along much better than you think
[00:11:02] you can
[00:11:04] all right so the next step this is more
[00:11:07] up my alley in terms of memory is if you
[00:11:10] want to remember what you're reading
[00:11:11] especially when you're doing those kind
[00:11:14] of techniques that I just previously
[00:11:15] mentioned you got to visualize so what I
[00:11:17] like to do as I'm letting these words
[00:11:20] kind of fill my mind as I zip through
[00:11:22] them with my guided finger with my
[00:11:23] narrowed margins with my intent I try to
[00:11:27] imagine I'm watching a movie so
[00:11:29] everything as I read it kind of plays in
[00:11:32] my mind it's not always perfect doesn't
[00:11:34] always kind of keep up because I'm going
[00:11:37] pretty fast but I try to really imagine
[00:11:39] what I'm seeing or reading plastered on
[00:11:42] some kind of cinema screen like a movie
[00:11:45] playing in my mind that makes everything
[00:11:47] happen almost in real time as if I were
[00:11:49] there experiencing it we're seeing it on
[00:11:52] a screen which has pictures and color
[00:11:54] and sound and all that stuff and you
[00:11:56] guys all know from watching dozens of my
[00:11:58] videos that visualization pictures in
[00:12:01] the mind is key to remembering anything
[00:12:03] simple as that
[00:12:06] alright those first five tips are really
[00:12:09] the majority of what you need to
[00:12:10] increase your speed and your retention
[00:12:13] of what you read these next five tips
[00:12:15] are really quick little tips that will
[00:12:16] help set you up for success to remember
[00:12:19] better to read faster as well the first
[00:12:21] one and I found this one really helpful
[00:12:23] I listen I'd never memorize the book so
[00:12:25] fast in one session but obviously I had
[00:12:29] a limit that train ride so so I was kind
[00:12:34] of stuck to reading for a long period of
[00:12:37] time in one sitting it was actually kind
[00:12:39] of cool because I was invested in the
[00:12:42] story I was in it and you know I didn't
[00:12:45] want to step out and then come back in
[00:12:46] and revisit everything I wanted
[00:12:47] everything to be fresh as I read it so I
[00:12:51] actually read for an hour non-stop took
[00:12:56] a break for a second then went back for
[00:12:58] another hour and a bit took a break and
[00:13:00] then finished off the rest of the train
[00:13:02] ride in another session and I think
[00:13:04] that's a great tip to really kind of
[00:13:06] carry you through the book and to stay
[00:13:08] motivated and to stay interested is to
[00:13:10] try longer reading sessions and the next
[00:13:13] tip is kind of contradictory but a
[00:13:15] little bit necessary is to take breaks
[00:13:17] this is a tiresome process you'll find
[00:13:20] your mind becoming a bit tired as you do
[00:13:22] this and your eyes you're probably not
[00:13:24] used to that moving so fast but take a
[00:13:27] break I took a break every hour seemed
[00:13:28] to be enough just for a few minutes then
[00:13:30] I got back and I continued on top of
[00:13:32] that you also should try to switch up
[00:13:36] locations so I was on the train so I had
[00:13:38] my seat but I actually got up a couple
[00:13:40] times I read standing up I read actually
[00:13:42] in the back of the Train in between cars
[00:13:45] and the reason I did that is because
[00:13:47] when you're reading a book a physical
[00:13:49] book why am i reading a physical book
[00:13:51] well because it's tangible right I'm
[00:13:53] somewhere holding this book there's a
[00:13:56] memory of that that will help me
[00:13:57] remember the book reading experience for
[00:14:00] that book double the whole point of this
[00:14:01] I wanted to read a book that I could
[00:14:02] remember and that I could remember when
[00:14:04] I read it
[00:14:05] so vary your location when you read
[00:14:07] it'll help you remember what you're
[00:14:09] actually reading next tip number 9
[00:14:11] practice I mean this doing this in
[00:14:14] itself is practiced right if you
[00:14:16] continue reading at this pace with those
[00:14:18] techniques
[00:14:19] you're essentially practicing for the
[00:14:21] entirety of a book you're gonna get
[00:14:22] better by the end of the book and I
[00:14:24] found that you know first a few like 20
[00:14:27] to 30 pages it was a bit uncomfortable I
[00:14:29] felt myself really pushing and I was
[00:14:31] like man I don't know if I can carry on
[00:14:33] with this for the next 2 and 1/2 hours
[00:14:34] but turned out after hour one it felt
[00:14:39] really natural
[00:14:40] I felt really good at it and I felt like
[00:14:42] I wasn't missing anything I felt like I
[00:14:44] was able to read all this stuff quickly
[00:14:47] absorb it visualize it all that stuff
[00:14:50] and it would felt really natural and
[00:14:51] finally you know this is kind of an
[00:14:54] after-the-fact kind of tip but it'll
[00:14:56] help you remember what you read for
[00:14:58] longer write it down write down a
[00:14:59] synopsis of what you read it doesn't
[00:15:01] have to be super detailed you can do it
[00:15:03] on your phone and Google Drive or
[00:15:05] literally by hand or even tell someone
[00:15:08] about it is to just kind of recap what
[00:15:10] you read just kind of the general idea
[00:15:12] of what you remembered from this book
[00:15:14] all those things will help you kind of
[00:15:15] solidify that entire speed reading
[00:15:18] session of you reading this book from
[00:15:20] start to finish really quickly in a day
[00:15:27] well that's all I got for you guys to
[00:15:30] tell you the truth this experiment was
[00:15:31] actually really enjoyable for me I was a
[00:15:33] bit afraid of it I didn't think I'd be
[00:15:34] able to do it but now I have this
[00:15:36] confidence that I know I can read a book
[00:15:39] in a day if I really want to and the
[00:15:42] best part about it is I know that you
[00:15:43] can do it too I knew that I was
[00:15:45] something that I could share with
[00:15:46] anybody and the experience was great you
[00:15:48] might think like well why would I want
[00:15:49] to rush through a book well there's tons
[00:15:51] of stuff I want to read and there's tons
[00:15:54] of moments where I would like to finish
[00:15:55] a book because if I don't finish it now
[00:15:57] I know that I won't finish it later I'm
[00:15:59] on vacation now for the holidays when I
[00:16:01] get back to Miami I know that I'm gonna
[00:16:03] be busy as hell and it's gonna be hard
[00:16:05] for me to maybe finish that book I have
[00:16:07] other stuff to do I will be reading more
[00:16:08] books in a day I'm sure of it I hope
[00:16:10] this inspires you to baby pick up a book
[00:16:12] that you've always wanted to read finish
[00:16:13] it and then move on to another book
[00:16:15] anyways that's enough of me thanks for
[00:16:18] watching please subscribe like share
[00:16:19] I'll see you in the next video happy
[00:16:21] holidays

=== Your MEMORY Is a collection of MEMES. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp07DfBxrHM

[00:00:00] let's talk about memes wait not those
[00:00:04] kinds of memes what well sort of
[00:00:06] they are memes after all but let's talk
[00:00:10] about real memes as in your memory
[00:00:14] believe it or not the idea of memes has
[00:00:16] been around for longer than you think
[00:00:18] way before success kid grumpy cat Drake
[00:00:21] fortnight old town road sad Keanu
[00:00:23] icebucketchallenge
[00:00:25] that Friday song dabbing and of course
[00:00:27] how could I forget
[00:00:29] gotcha before all that the word was
[00:00:32] first used in Richard Dawkins The
[00:00:34] Selfish Gene back in 1976 1976
[00:00:38] yeah I know in his book he explains just
[00:00:41] as genes propagate themselves in the
[00:00:43] gene pool by leaping from body to body
[00:00:45] via sperms or eggs so memes propagate
[00:00:48] themselves in the mean pool by leaping
[00:00:50] from brain to brain via process which in
[00:00:52] the broad sense can be called imitation
[00:00:54] a meme technically can be anything an
[00:00:57] idea a song a catchphrase ways of doing
[00:01:00] things some form of idea that can spread
[00:01:03] but I prefer Douglas Hofstadter's
[00:01:04] broader definition of the term as a
[00:01:06] library is an organized collection of
[00:01:08] books so a memory is an organized
[00:01:10] collection of memes our memories are a
[00:01:13] collection of memes it's impossible to
[00:01:15] remember every single moment in our
[00:01:17] lives so the Selective ideas experiences
[00:01:20] and thoughts that play in our mind in
[00:01:22] the present over the ones that have
[00:01:23] faded away and become forgotten those
[00:01:25] are our memes and the result is our
[00:01:28] memory they make up who we are
[00:01:31] so here I am filming a video on this
[00:01:34] couch for the last time in this
[00:01:35] apartment where I've spent the last four
[00:01:37] years where I've gotten married got a
[00:01:39] dog raised a kid wrote a book memorized
[00:01:42] slept laughed
[00:01:43] broke 50,000 subscribers thank you by
[00:01:46] the way we're moving not too far just
[00:01:49] really down the street but not here this
[00:01:53] place where I started my youtube channel
[00:01:55] will be no more becoming hopefully one
[00:01:58] of the many memes that I hope propagates
[00:02:00] into my long-term memory and build
[00:02:02] itself into the long-form story that is
[00:02:03] my life
[00:02:05] life passes by in a blink of an eye
[00:02:07] before you know it
[00:02:08] high school is over and you suddenly
[00:02:09] find yourself 35 thinking whoa where did
[00:02:13] it all go but thankfully I value my
[00:02:17] memory and I try my best to cultivate
[00:02:19] and curate those precious memes my
[00:02:21] engineer as best I can
[00:02:23] those very memes that I wanted to
[00:02:24] propagate it's not easy it doesn't
[00:02:26] always work but I can often happily and
[00:02:29] satisfactorily say to myself you played
[00:02:31] out that moment in the most memorable
[00:02:33] way possible gold star buddy that means
[00:02:36] I lived it I was there
[00:02:38] present paid attention to the details so
[00:02:41] with that as much as I'll miss this
[00:02:43] place this cozy apartment and a
[00:02:45] not-so-great building on a not so great
[00:02:47] corner of Miami I know my name's already
[00:02:49] anxiously waiting in line to join the
[00:02:51] epic library that is my life thanks for
[00:02:54] listening now on to create some new
[00:02:56] memes and onwards to a hundred thousand
[00:02:59] subscribers
[00:03:01] [Music]
[00:03:07] [Music]
[00:03:17] [Music]
[00:03:25] [Music]
[00:03:32] here we are this is my new set not the
[00:03:37] only set I'm ever going to use but this
[00:03:39] is my new couch area in our new place
[00:03:43] and it looks pretty similar I'm still on
[00:03:47] it
[00:03:48] same old business anyways I'm so excited
[00:03:51] to be kind of in a fresh place to create
[00:03:54] more content for you guys and to create
[00:03:56] more memories honestly in my life it's
[00:03:59] all about those next steps and just kind
[00:04:02] of building my collection of memes right
[00:04:04] into my memory library and one of the
[00:04:08] reasons why I made this video in the
[00:04:09] first place is I kind of wanted to at
[00:04:11] the tail end talk about something that's
[00:04:13] super important to me I don't really get
[00:04:15] a chance to mention it much emotionally
[00:04:18] kind of tough to talk about but it is
[00:04:20] part of the reason why I'm making these
[00:04:22] videos why I made this channel and why I
[00:04:25] am Who I am today and that is
[00:04:28] Alzheimer's many of you know my
[00:04:31] grandmother passed away from Alzheimer's
[00:04:32] in 2009 and that's what kind of led me
[00:04:35] on this journey to becoming the us
[00:04:37] memory champion
[00:04:38] anyways part of my journey to kind of
[00:04:41] becoming a champion and an advocate for
[00:04:44] memory techniques is I always wanted to
[00:04:46] bring it back and to let people know
[00:04:48] about Alzheimer's through my charity
[00:04:51] which I started years ago I climb
[00:04:52] mountains for charities through climb
[00:04:54] for memory if you're interested you can
[00:04:55] check out the link in the description
[00:04:57] but that's not anything new something
[00:05:00] new that is actually happening that I'm
[00:05:02] super excited about is I've partnered
[00:05:05] with a company called map habit I'm
[00:05:07] gonna do a separate video on that
[00:05:09] entirely just to show you what it is
[00:05:11] what it does how awesome it is and how
[00:05:14] life-changing it can be for those with
[00:05:16] Alzheimer's or people for people who are
[00:05:19] caretakers of those with Alzheimer's I'm
[00:05:21] always looking for ways to kind of
[00:05:23] change the Alzheimer's research
[00:05:25] landscape which is pretty bleak
[00:05:27] unfortunately this app in short it's an
[00:05:30] out for a smart device so
[00:05:32] tablet or phone and basically either the
[00:05:34] caretaker can use it or the person with
[00:05:36] Alzheimer's can use it and it interacts
[00:05:38] with them on a daily basis it's kind of
[00:05:40] like their assistant it helps remind
[00:05:42] them to do certain tasks very simple
[00:05:44] tasks but it sets reminders it shows
[00:05:47] them how to do certain things
[00:05:49] step-by-step the most basic things that
[00:05:51] people with Alzheimer's and dementia
[00:05:52] struggle with you know how to take a
[00:05:55] shower reminding people to take a shower
[00:05:57] reminding them to take the pills anyways
[00:05:59] like I said I'm gonna go through that in
[00:06:01] more detail in a separate video but for
[00:06:02] now go check out their website and if
[00:06:05] you know anybody that works in this

=== Staying in a $1000 A NIGHT Memory Palace in AMALFI COAST ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aUiJuWUvZc

[00:00:08] [Music]
[00:00:39] what's up guys Nelson Dellis here and I
[00:00:42] am in Italy in the Amalfi Coast and I'm
[00:00:45] staying in this crazy thousand dollar a
[00:00:47] night hotel it is stunning
[00:00:49] hotels stunning the views are stunning
[00:00:52] they put me up here because I'm here
[00:00:54] filming some client work and my first
[00:00:56] thought when I got here is this is a
[00:00:57] perfect memory palace definitely using
[00:01:00] this in the future to store stuff so I
[00:01:01] figured I'd make a video doing a tour of
[00:01:03] the place so you can see how amazing it
[00:01:05] is but also more importantly so that you
[00:01:07] can have a new memory palace to use to
[00:01:09] memorise whatever you want so I'm gonna
[00:01:10] show you ten spots around this place all
[00:01:13] you have to do is watch this video and
[00:01:14] by the end of it you'll have a new
[00:01:16] memory palace that you can actually use
[00:01:18] to store stuff and on top of that it's a
[00:01:19] beautiful location you have this super
[00:01:21] expensive chic hotel has one of your
[00:01:23] memory palaces you're welcome let's go
[00:01:26] check it out
[00:01:26] [Music]
[00:03:05] all right so we start our tour in this
[00:03:08] impressive room and I don't know if this
[00:03:12] is the biggest from ABBA I don't think
[00:03:13] it is
[00:03:14] I've seen some floors up above that have
[00:03:16] a whole balcony and such so this might
[00:03:19] be the lower tier of the rooms but it is
[00:03:21] beautiful nonetheless exquisite
[00:03:24] attention to detail my favorite feature
[00:03:26] of this room is that ridiculous ceiling
[00:03:29] what is that is that original or did
[00:03:33] they make it that way I don't know just
[00:03:36] awesome makes this room feel huge you
[00:03:38] know it's not second thing is this
[00:03:40] amazing desk makes me want to write
[00:03:43] letters from it hundred sixty-five
[00:03:46] letters to like my mom while looking
[00:03:49] over the Mediterranean Sea while looking
[00:03:57] over the Adriatic Sea while looking over
[00:04:02] the sea here and you know there's just a
[00:04:04] case full of books which I'll never read
[00:04:07] but they look pretty awesome
[00:04:09] and yeah that's this room what's going
[00:04:14] downstairs into the lobby
[00:04:16] so here we are this is kind of a main
[00:04:18] action area super cool what could be
[00:04:21] ceilings I don't know if that's real
[00:04:23] rock or whatever but basically
[00:04:26] this is how you enter from your bedroom
[00:04:29] and memorable let's go into the next
[00:04:33] room over here so here's kind of like a
[00:04:35] bar slash drinking so long I guess feels
[00:04:39] very James Bondish 1950 1960s south but
[00:04:46] uh yeah the little chairs nooks and
[00:04:49] crannies that you can store stuff in in
[00:04:50] your memory palace yeah let's go so
[00:04:54] here's the next location it's basically
[00:04:55] the entryway to this wonderful space
[00:04:58] this is kind of like the entryway from
[00:05:00] the only 2,000 steps we need to get down
[00:05:04] here
[00:05:05] and just outside this door are literally
[00:05:10] 200 steps to the street so we actually
[00:05:13] at the park her car and take our two
[00:05:15] massive suitcase down those stairs
[00:05:17] that's the price you got to pay to be
[00:05:20] here anyways
[00:05:20] beautiful location you got the door here
[00:05:23] you got a little branch tree there some
[00:05:26] little bench here another tree you can
[00:05:30] really use a space to store a few things
[00:05:32] then walking over here this is kind of
[00:05:36] nice little veranda with an incredible
[00:05:40] view like everything else and a number
[00:05:43] of cables here this is where we had
[00:05:46] dinner last night
[00:05:48] by candlelight yeah that speaks for
[00:05:53] itself I'm just gonna shut up and let
[00:05:55] you see that
[00:05:59] and we have our next location which is
[00:06:01] basically the main dining area that's
[00:06:04] where we have breakfast lunch you're
[00:06:06] gonna have dinner there whatever you
[00:06:07] want basically this is nice but it
[00:06:10] doesn't look anything quite like it does
[00:06:11] at night when everything is letting up
[00:06:13] by candlelight and kind of mood lighting
[00:06:16] it's stunning
[00:06:19] and memorable and definitely outside of
[00:06:22] our budget range
[00:06:23] here's another location basically I
[00:06:25] think one of the rooms you're not in
[00:06:27] this room but there's a nice little
[00:06:28] patio the beds in there
[00:06:31] a few things you can use to store stuff
[00:06:34] yeah yeah next up we have this beautiful
[00:06:39] water fountain area then we serve any
[00:06:43] other purpose than to look nice make
[00:06:45] this place look fancy but I appreciate
[00:06:47] it and I'm going to use it as a memory
[00:06:49] toss mmm looks like something Game of
[00:06:52] Thrones right busy sir see walking
[00:06:55] down next dark on the other side all
[00:06:58] right it's so next up we have this
[00:07:00] gorgeous pool deck which looks amazing
[00:07:03] and you'd think that there'd be a ton of
[00:07:04] people out here you think I'd be laying
[00:07:06] out here but actually doesn't compare to
[00:07:09] what's down there so I'm gonna be gonna
[00:07:12] hang out here it's not worth it this is
[00:07:13] disgusting is this no it's gross anyway
[00:07:18] here's a pool there's a few kind of deck
[00:07:20] chairs here the tree umbrellas stuff
[00:07:23] like that you can use all of that as
[00:07:25] locations in this one spot so beautiful
[00:07:28] area for a memory palace location all
[00:07:33] right let's move on so next up we have a
[00:07:35] stand here next up we have this kind of
[00:07:38] like lemon tree patch and there's some
[00:07:43] lemons on the floor or whatever but
[00:07:44] basically this is gonna be a location in
[00:07:46] itself to maybe choose a few spots like
[00:07:48] the end the middle and the other end
[00:07:49] it's up to you all right this space will
[00:07:52] be the next location for hotel has a
[00:07:55] patch of lemon trees right I was even
[00:07:58] told we're free to pick them actually
[00:08:00] this region is known for its lemon so I
[00:08:02] might just actually pick one and
[00:08:04] I really eat lemons listen yeah whatever
[00:08:08] alright and so finally we have our last
[00:08:10] location which is basically this view
[00:08:13] over the sea the Mediterranean Sea the
[00:08:16] rocks and the kind of layout area of
[00:08:18] this hotel just unbelievable I don't
[00:08:21] even want to talk to you guys anywhere I
[00:08:22] want to go lay out read my book and dive
[00:08:26] in and go swimming so it's one quick tip
[00:08:29] I mean this is one location and this
[00:08:32] memory palace but there's clearly a ton
[00:08:34] of stuff you can use to expand your
[00:08:36] memory palace you can use the layout
[00:08:37] chairs the umbrellas the different rocks
[00:08:40] even the castle that's on the outcrop
[00:08:42] there the see the boats passing by so
[00:08:45] there's a ton packed into this one
[00:08:47] location doesn't have to be just one
[00:08:48] location but I'm trying to generalize
[00:08:50] here yeah you know what I'm gonna stop
[00:08:52] talking and go for a swim and enjoy this
[00:08:56] rather than making a video probably
[00:08:58] never gonna be here again so there we go
[00:09:00] we have 10 locations this was the last
[00:09:02] one yeah I'm gonna stop talking now
[00:09:03] that's the whole place guys isn't it
[00:09:05] nuts isn't it beautiful
[00:09:07] I can't even believe I'm stay here I
[00:09:08] don't know what I'm doing here I do not
[00:09:10] belong here anyways you now have 10
[00:09:12] locations that you can store new
[00:09:14] information now a lot of those rooms
[00:09:16] were actually you know they had a few
[00:09:19] things in them so you'd actually expand
[00:09:20] those 10 locations to keep it more if
[00:09:22] you wanted to but at a very basic level
[00:09:23] you had 10 areas for your memory palace
[00:09:26] now I'm thinking about doing maybe a few
[00:09:28] more of these videos over time I think
[00:09:29] it's a great way to help some of you
[00:09:31] guys out there that are stuck in
[00:09:32] creating memory palaces you know maybe I
[00:09:34] have one two three or four or five but
[00:09:36] you can't really think of any more
[00:09:37] places I'm here that's what I'm here for
[00:09:40] I'm here to help you guys become
[00:09:41] proficient memorizers so that means you
[00:09:44] need more memory palaces here's another
[00:09:46] one and hopefully more in the future so

[00:09:53] button the bell so you get notifications

[00:02:51] cards yep and you've already made some
[00:02:53] progress right yeah sure what's your
[00:02:55] what's your best time at this point

[00:03:06] pitfalls and kind of roadblocks that

[00:03:16] looking forward to it looking forward to
[00:03:17] melting my time down coming for you I'm
[00:03:19] coming for this guy so I was my previous
[00:03:21] time five minutes 31 the best time ever
[00:03:23] to take stuff I'm gonna try to beat that
[00:03:26] right now
[00:03:27] he's got a big head so do people know
[00:03:30] how tall you are ya know so Nelson's
[00:03:34] like 611 yeah he's actually like six
[00:03:38] five and you divorced me I'm 63
[00:03:40] but I feel like I'm 5 11 X again I feel
[00:03:43] like I'm lead but leaves actually 510
[00:03:45] lead Lee tells me blaze 511 and a half
[00:03:48] yeah well people are 511 and a half
[00:03:52] though they say they're six foot ya know
[00:03:55] yeah exactly
[00:03:55] Yeah right yeah says they're six foot
[00:03:59] I'm like you're five yeah alright okay
[00:04:03] [Music]
[00:04:15] eight clubs five close once I get past
[00:04:25] this like initial hump for clubs I'm
[00:04:32] gonna say be the buzz yeah okay remember
[00:04:36] a hard times nine of Hearts Jack of
[00:04:40] Hearts so I wasn't really happy with my
[00:04:44] first attempt and now that's like kind
[00:04:46] of my first step around people
[00:04:47] especially on a memory champion kind of
[00:04:49] makes you nervous so I'm gonna go into a
[00:04:51] different line palace and try to try to
[00:04:54] memorize a deck hopefully they don't get
[00:04:57] too many mistakes I'm down to get a few
[00:04:58] mistakes I just not as many as I had I
[00:05:00] think that's the most I've ever had to
[00:05:01] kind of kind of weighs on me so I got
[00:05:04] you know you know focus here focus hard
[00:05:06] try to beat my time
[00:05:08] [Music]
[00:05:22] better a longer time but I feel better
[00:05:26] than the last one
[00:05:27] it's good still struggled too sometimes
[00:05:30] I had these I had images and they just
[00:05:32] weren't I had the cards and I wasn't
[00:05:34] seeing the images right away yeah it
[00:05:36] took me a good 10 seconds to see this oh
[00:05:38] I don't know if it's cause it's later in
[00:05:39] the day we're tired we've worked I don't
[00:05:41] know where the excuses there but I do
[00:05:43] feel better about this one place here we
[00:05:46] go
[00:05:49] ten of Spades nine space
[00:06:08] [Music]
[00:06:19] so you just did a deck of cards in
[00:06:22] around six and a half minutes yes which
[00:06:24] is very respectable especially
[00:06:26] considering you've only been doing this
[00:06:27] what twelve day yes yeah Todd this
[00:06:29] that's amazing so I want to give you a
[00:06:31] few tips and any of your viewers that
[00:06:33] came over from our initial video and
[00:06:35] some of my viewers that have learned
[00:06:37] already how to memorize a deck of cards
[00:06:39] some of the things to look out for or to
[00:06:42] pay attention to to kind of build your
[00:06:44] speed hopefully this helps you a little
[00:06:45] bit yeah I'm looking forward to the
[00:06:50] first tip is probably to know your
[00:06:52] images okay so first of all making sure
[00:06:55] that all the images that you have that
[00:06:57] represent the person may actually the
[00:06:59] object you're 52 cards but they're
[00:07:01] meaningful to you and that also you want
[00:07:03] to be able to recognize them as quickly
[00:07:05] as possible more meaningful they are the
[00:07:07] quicker they'll be able to be accessed
[00:07:09] in your mind so one kind of drill I give
[00:07:11] people is instead of memorizing all the
[00:07:14] time do a few sets of just going through
[00:07:16] as fast as you can in your head
[00:07:19] recalling the image just the individual
[00:07:21] image yeah well you can say the person
[00:07:23] excellent object so I'd say you know my
[00:07:25] friend our dough bouncing on a dog so
[00:07:28] that's seen you don't see it that's just
[00:07:30] mentally say it to God as quickly as
[00:07:32] possible
[00:07:32] the reason for this is I was like to
[00:07:34] think of this as your upper limit
[00:07:37] memorization because you can't memorize
[00:07:38] faster than you can save images right
[00:07:40] right okay so and the faster you can
[00:07:43] drop that then that's your limit that's
[00:07:47] your that's your limit so I can do this
[00:07:49] around low twenty seconds so that means
[00:07:51] I'm able to memorise around 30 seconds
[00:07:53] I'm pretty close to my limit which is
[00:07:56] what you want to be and so getting to
[00:07:58] know your images by training that is a
[00:08:00] huge way to make leaps in your speed in
[00:08:03] a forum on your website you'd written to
[00:08:05] someone that take a few cards and keep
[00:08:08] in your pocket yeah yeah I was gonna say
[00:08:10] that too like I would go and have I
[00:08:12] would take a card or two each day and go
[00:08:14] like have lunch with them yeah put them
[00:08:16] like on my gate yeah yeah my dashboard
[00:08:19] of my car right we're like a windowsill
[00:08:20] next to my table just to you
[00:08:22] automatically so I'm working
[00:08:24] there's Britney Spears hey you know or
[00:08:26] I'm in the shower there's uh Britney
[00:08:28] Spears hey hey no you really get to know
[00:08:31] those images by the end of the day it's
[00:08:33] like you hung out with that person and
[00:08:35] it's yep - her space and then
[00:08:37] automatically you just you just see it
[00:08:38] you know it it's done yep yeah so like
[00:08:41] worse comes to worse at a 52 cards like
[00:08:43] that's a month of getting to know two
[00:08:46] cards yeah right it's worth it yeah
[00:08:48] totally worth it yeah yeah so the next
[00:08:52] one I like to tell people is to trust in
[00:08:54] your memory I say this a lot but
[00:08:56] especially with cards part of the trust
[00:09:00] issues people can't believe that their
[00:09:01] memory is able to go through all 52 and
[00:09:05] not go back so I always tell people try
[00:09:08] not to go back it's kind of instinctive
[00:09:10] to want to jump back is really hot I
[00:09:12] forgot and I got a go look at these
[00:09:14] cards again but really you got to just
[00:09:16] go through it and yeah you're gonna make
[00:09:18] some mistakes but that's how you're
[00:09:20] gonna be able to get faster cuz every
[00:09:21] time you double back you're wasting 200
[00:09:24] wasting time one thing is when is it
[00:09:28] when you're by yourself
[00:09:29] is it better to skip the card and come
[00:09:34] back to it or just look at it knowing
[00:09:36] that you might have erred like that that
[00:09:38] might be a mistake
[00:09:39] so during recall I'm here and I say
[00:09:42] eight of clubs ah it was the jack of
[00:09:45] spades is that better than to just be
[00:09:47] like I'm not sure I'll keep it for after
[00:09:50] I think it's better to keep it for after
[00:09:52] better make no mistakes and just keep it
[00:09:55] for after yeah because what you'll do
[00:09:56] with this after is try to figure it out
[00:09:59] right yeah maybe you won't but at least
[00:10:01] you'll go through the exercise of use a
[00:10:03] lot of times if I don't see this one I
[00:10:05] won't see these yeah well that's the
[00:10:08] thing yeah so like but if I do this one
[00:10:10] I'll be like oh then
[00:10:12] yeah yeah but you want to be able to to
[00:10:15] recall the entire call the entire image
[00:10:16] yeah so I recommend putting a card aside
[00:10:19] if that means putting three cards aside
[00:10:20] comes a group of three then so be it
[00:10:22] now then afterwards you can try to go
[00:10:25] through process of elimination like I
[00:10:27] did in your video that makes sense yeah
[00:10:32] so another one to get faster is speed /
[00:10:36] accuracy so I like people to push for
[00:10:40] speed right and um you know you might be
[00:10:42] tempted to stay cool and calm because
[00:10:45] you know you can get everything right if
[00:10:47] you go this speed and you don't really
[00:10:49] want to push that but you won't really
[00:10:50] get much faster if you don't push the
[00:10:52] envelope writer so naturally you go
[00:10:54] faster for the first time you're bound
[00:10:57] to make mistakes and that's okay you
[00:10:59] just got to get your brain kind of
[00:11:01] feeling what it's like to go through it
[00:11:03] that fast
[00:11:03] okay I think that works wonders for
[00:11:06] building your speed and if you have a
[00:11:09] hard time doing that because you kind of
[00:11:10] want to get them right so you go a
[00:11:12] little slower and you can't help it is
[00:11:13] it's helpful to set up a metronome you
[00:11:15] know I've heard of that yeah so just
[00:11:17] like so that every other beat you can
[00:11:19] look at a car yeah if it's you want to
[00:11:21] set a beat to each card you look at or
[00:11:23] four or yeah exactly
[00:11:25] you can set that tempo and then slightly
[00:11:27] so you have like more beats per per card
[00:11:30] or three beats per card then working
[00:11:32] down to one beat per car exactly yeah
[00:11:33] the Biba might be a bit distracting at
[00:11:35] first but also that's a good distraction
[00:11:37] practice with distracting yes speaking
[00:11:39] of distractions I pick these up or
[00:11:42] something similar
[00:11:43] yeah and they help me a lot but I do
[00:11:45] feel like if I don't have them yeah it's
[00:11:47] kind of a crutch as well it is a crutch
[00:11:49] it's by safe space when I put them on
[00:11:51] but uh it is a good technique also to
[00:11:53] get it yet not necessarily faster but
[00:11:55] better under pressure
[00:11:56] yeah to use without and even put noise
[00:11:59] on like whether it's a TV show
[00:12:01] or do it in a public place drying it out
[00:12:04] with your yeah because if you can do it
[00:12:05] there then you can definitely with those
[00:12:08] on yeah out of competition and quiet
[00:12:11] another tip don't speed up at the end
[00:12:13] you suggested this I think that's a
[00:12:15] great tip yeah you know you think you're
[00:12:17] almost done you just want to kind of
[00:12:18] get those last few seconds and you maybe
[00:12:20] don't give enough love to those last
[00:12:22] ones yep
[00:12:22] and you forget them so which is funny
[00:12:24] because if you're if you're not into
[00:12:26] memory stuff you would think that the
[00:12:27] first ones are the hardest to remember
[00:12:28] yeah
[00:12:29] cuz in the part of this thing go and
[00:12:30] then the first ones are usually the
[00:12:32] easiest to remember because that's where
[00:12:34] you start that's first image in your
[00:12:36] mind pal so easy peasy so it's it's kind
[00:12:39] of counterintuitive to think that the
[00:12:40] last one you looked at is the one you
[00:12:41] forget right what you can do is some
[00:12:45] people will grab the last few cards like
[00:12:47] say the thing in your head then hit the
[00:12:49] timer close your eyes and then make sure
[00:12:51] to encode it right there right you can
[00:12:54] say okay that's you know yeah c-3po
[00:12:56] dancing with a mushroom if you close
[00:12:59] your eyes you're done but now you're
[00:13:01] encoding it before you go back and
[00:13:03] review everything yeah and then finally
[00:13:07] last tip I think is to make sure that
[00:13:09] you have enough memory policies right
[00:13:11] when people start the South they have
[00:13:13] maybe one memory palace maybe two yeah
[00:13:15] but if you're practicing this everyday
[00:13:16] you're gonna be repeating the same
[00:13:18] memory collars for quite frequently and
[00:13:20] you can have echoes of images did you
[00:13:22] get what process I have yeah i'vei've
[00:13:24] because I only have two memory palaces
[00:13:26] at the moment I'll use the same one
[00:13:29] maybe twice a day and it'll it'll cause
[00:13:32] mistakes they I'm not too bad to get
[00:13:35] around it but usually it'll cause
[00:13:36] mistakes and I'll know where those
[00:13:37] mistakes are as soon as I'm unsure of an
[00:13:39] image yeah and I think a mistake like
[00:13:41] that is catastrophic because then you're
[00:13:44] using an entire person action object
[00:13:47] right right in the wrong place so you're
[00:13:49] replacing it with another person action
[00:13:50] object which can be separated into three
[00:13:52] other personalities not exact same exact
[00:13:54] it's catastrophic so it's like not what
[00:13:55] you want to do yeah so I have way too
[00:13:59] many I think but I think having a cycle
[00:14:01] of maybe five to seven different memory
[00:14:03] palaces for training cards if you're
[00:14:05] going to do it every day is it kind of a
[00:14:07] nice sweet spot and if you're using pa-o
[00:14:10] that means they're only need to be 17
[00:14:12] images over card which is pretty
[00:14:15] reasonable 17 or 18 not a big memory
[00:14:17] dolls that's a mytab right now what's
[00:14:19] your biggest memory thoughts oh when I
[00:14:22] memorized 10,000 digits of pi so it was
[00:14:25] 2,000 location
[00:14:26] how is that even possible can you walk
[00:14:29] me just quickly you're like how is that
[00:14:31] do you have like it was oh I have a room
[00:14:33] in a thousand drawers let me go perfect
[00:14:35] it couldn't be limited to rooms it was
[00:14:37] basically sprawling my hometown Miami
[00:14:40] and each thousand digits which is 200
[00:14:44] locations each was like a place like one
[00:14:47] was a mall one was my house plus the air
[00:14:50] surrounding area you know so they were
[00:14:52] like neighborhoods of the city yeah yeah
[00:14:56] it was a lot to manage and if you ain't
[00:14:59] emptied it out no no it needs to review
[00:15:03] some of its hit dusty but so what if I
[00:15:06] told you to go to the mall look at this
[00:15:11] no no no stop it don't ruin it just
[00:15:17] hopefully leads you right out is old ten
[00:15:20] thousand digits how did the feet of
[00:15:22] memory champion just show them through
[00:15:23] your atom cards and say this is in your
[00:15:25] house no I can't stop thinking about it
[00:15:27] thanks gonna be replace I'm screwed no

[00:00:11] here with Chris Ramsey YouTube star
[00:00:14] magician he's about to blow my mind I'm
[00:00:16] already my mind is ready blunt and I'm
[00:00:18] just gonna react
[00:00:19] so you sir you use your mind Palace and
[00:00:24] everything else right I thought I
[00:00:26] thought it'd be really cool if if a
[00:00:28] magician actually got inside your mind
[00:00:30] Palace know like I know it sounds like
[00:00:33] that but I would like to attempt to
[00:00:35] enter your mind Palace okay if you would
[00:00:38] take this dice yeah and and show the
[00:00:41] camera there all different on every side
[00:00:43] right seems pretty fair and I'll watch
[00:00:45] you too in your hands hold it in your
[00:00:48] hands shake it around and and just look
[00:00:51] at the top number that's on the top of
[00:00:53] that dice okay you got it
[00:00:59] yeah now I want you to imagine placing
[00:01:02] that number in your mind house okay
[00:01:06] where are you I'm at my home yeah hey
[00:01:10] which room I'm at the front door the
[00:01:12] front door yeah so I feel like you're
[00:01:15] knocking at the front door to get in
[00:01:16] you're knocking five times yeah yeah
[00:01:24] yeah I tried again might be luck might
[00:01:26] be a lot you were gonna get shaken don't
[00:01:27] even show the camera this time okay okay
[00:01:29] so imagine where I'm putting it yeah
[00:01:32] okay in your house again same house but
[00:01:36] on the couch the three seater yeah yeah
[00:01:47] look I was like cow cheese I have like
[00:01:49] three feeder isn't that you shouldn't
[00:01:52] went there yeah he's mapping out his
[00:01:54] mind house I'm going a different he
[00:01:56] doesn't know that allowing me access to
[00:01:59] his mind palace is actually very
[00:02:00] dangerous and I'll demonstrate why
[00:02:03] afterwards
[00:02:06] okay you got it yep okay where is it
[00:02:10] it's in the physics auditorium at the
[00:02:14] universe the universe Miami yeah huge
[00:02:17] seating hall with a big chalkboard one
[00:02:19] of this feel like in the movies yeah
[00:02:21] double when there's like an auditorium
[00:02:22] like seats going down like this it's
[00:02:24] near the front or the back of the middle
[00:02:25] it's at the front by the time I'm
[00:02:28] looking up at it in the chalkboard I
[00:02:30] want you to imagine you're writing a
[00:02:31] number on this chalkboard okay you're
[00:02:35] writing a number five god yeah yep yes
[00:02:37] yes I am okay I mean so now that I'm
[00:02:41] inside your mind Palace which is a lot
[00:02:43] of fun since we're in there we're gonna
[00:02:45] we're gonna mess with you a little bit
[00:02:47] okay okay and this might freak you out
[00:02:49] okay aunt Webb can you come over here it
[00:02:54] is experimental but I'm gonna enter your
[00:02:58] mind okay be gentle and I'm gonna enter
[00:03:03] your mind all right I'll try and just
[00:03:06] say stop whenever you like stop right
[00:03:08] there
[00:03:09] yep I want you to look at that card got
[00:03:13] it yep
[00:03:19] close your eyes and plug your ears hard
[00:03:22] as you can
[00:03:33] okay your card is the four of spades
[00:03:36] yeah plugged yeah completely plug what
[00:03:45] wait yeah I'm just trying I understand
[00:03:48] so what happened I heard a voice in my
[00:03:51] head was it my voice I think so yeah put
[00:03:55] it where would that have come from did
[00:03:57] you hear it what how did you do what did
[00:04:01] where did that come from inside your
[00:04:03] head no it did it you plug your ears
[00:04:05] where else would it come from that was
[00:04:07] like from a speaker but a speaker inside
[00:04:11] your head like a voice inside your head
[00:04:13] yeah it told me to say the four of
[00:04:15] Spades they they're not gonna believe
[00:04:17] you know you know that right have we
[00:04:19] talked about damn crazy
[00:04:20] I talked to Dallas and I was like
[00:04:21] they're just some tricks that are too
[00:04:23] perfect and that people are just not
[00:04:26] gonna believe because it's the Internet
[00:04:27] and that's fine oh but the important
[00:04:30] thing is that you know what happened
[00:04:32] yeah yeah yeah I do
[00:04:34] thanks for letting me into your into
[00:04:36] your head man appreciate it that's it
[00:04:38] was fine in there so take your phone in
[00:04:39] your calculator actually we're gonna do
[00:04:41] something we're gonna try it differently
[00:04:42] so hide this from me and clear the
[00:04:44] screen make sure it's clear yeah and I
[00:04:46] want you to put in put in the birthday
[00:04:48] of someone close to you that I wouldn't
[00:04:50] know so their day month or month day or
[00:04:53] however not the year just not the year
[00:04:56] yeah four digits and if it only comes
[00:04:58] down to three numbers it's fine to press
[00:05:00] plus and oh you're it's interesting how
[00:05:06] many views do you think this video is
[00:05:08] going to get put that in there don't
[00:05:11] tell anybody I wish they would gather
[00:05:12] sure you overshot that for sure if
[00:05:17] you're taking that long hit plus and I
[00:05:21] want you to put in a four-digit number
[00:05:23] that you're thinking of so this could be
[00:05:24] your pin code that you had before and
[00:05:28] then equals can I see that number so
[00:05:31] this number is not the number you're
[00:05:33] thinking of and you guys can see it at
[00:05:35] home here one one zero one four one
[00:05:38] seven
[00:05:40] obviously more than four digits but the
[00:05:42] thing is had I done this with you or him
[00:05:45] or him it would be completely different
[00:05:46] number sure right so to some extent it
[00:05:48] is a personal number yeah and we do
[00:05:50] choose numbers based on like a personal
[00:05:52] like a personal thing most the time
[00:05:55] guys like mean a lot of guys we just
[00:05:58] want to get into the phone real quickly
[00:05:59] right so will like to to Gigi to be like
[00:06:02] password or something easy women a lot
[00:06:05] of time will choose like a personal
[00:06:06] number yours if I'm not mistaken is a
[00:06:09] mix of both like you do lead like an
[00:06:12] express lifestyle so yeah maybe you'd
[00:06:14] think like if I want to create a
[00:06:16] password I gotta get into it quickly
[00:06:17] without forgetting it even though you're
[00:06:19] a memory champion but it it would be
[00:06:23] something that you wouldn't forget that
[00:06:24] you have to get your phone fast but
[00:06:25] there's also I feel a personal
[00:06:27] connection to that number somewhere
[00:06:29] maybe a sports number yes the sports
[00:06:32] number okay so there is some type of
[00:06:34] personal thing there and then over time
[00:06:35] you just kind of molded it into what it
[00:06:37] is right that's true yeah so there is a
[00:06:40] number that repeats itself yes okay you
[00:06:44] and could you how many languages could
[00:06:46] you say the first number in quite a bit
[00:06:50] right yeah so it's like a load number I
[00:06:52] think it's a one the one repeats itself
[00:06:53] twice yes but not right next to just one
[00:06:57] and then two and then one and then two
[00:06:59] once you want you twelve was my
[00:07:04] basketball jersey but it also in more
[00:07:07] recent days that's because it's my
[00:07:09] number Oh
[00:07:10] every world I COI see it comes from my
[00:07:13] basketball okay cool all right so let's
[00:07:17] try let's try another one here take
[00:07:21] these place them behind your back and
[00:07:26] and give a cut cut the deck anywhere you
[00:07:28] like okay and we you know afterwards
[00:07:32] we'll show the camera this is a
[00:07:33] completely normal deck they're not a
[00:07:35] bunch of duplicates or anything I've cut
[00:07:36] it again if you like I want you to take
[00:07:39] the top card and a hold of close your
[00:07:41] test do not look at it all right perfect
[00:07:44] so at this at this point neither one of
[00:07:46] us either one of us know what this card
[00:07:49] is right which is which is super
[00:07:51] interesting well I'm gonna I'm gonna try
[00:07:53] to have you guess it okay
[00:07:56] and I'd be cool all right red or black
[00:07:58] black okay perfect clubs spades spades
[00:08:01] perfect give me a number between 0 and
[00:08:03] 13
[00:08:06] have a look look that's insane was it
[00:08:15] yeah that was a good one all right
[00:08:24] [Music]
[00:08:47] so I tried this was a nice space
[00:08:50] oh there's a nice trees all along I
[00:08:52] wasn't gonna change I mean what's
[00:08:53] interesting is that there's no real way
[00:08:54] of me knowing that I was in that space
[00:08:56] and there was no way that you knew that
[00:08:58] that was the nice thing no but then so
[00:09:00] the black and red right what if I had
[00:09:04] chosen red yeah
[00:09:06] it would have that would have sucked do
[00:09:08] you just abandon ship at that point I
[00:09:10] could have well but you didn't even know
[00:09:12] either
[00:09:12] yeah well it's that's the whole thing
[00:09:14] right crap so you're going into a blind
[00:09:16] eye I can tell you for a fact I did know
[00:09:18] I didn't know what your card was and my
[00:09:21] whole my whole point was to guide you to
[00:09:24] that card I see right and so normally
[00:09:27] this trick would work and I would I
[00:09:29] would guess your card and you'd still be
[00:09:31] impressed yeah but I think it's just so
[00:09:33] much more impressive if you guessed your
[00:09:35] own card that you didn't even see you
[00:09:38] know so when I went to read a black
[00:09:40] there was a small so I I said do you
[00:09:43] want red or black yeah so red I said a
[00:09:46] little bit quiet or black a little bit
[00:09:47] louder and I was more engaged so I was
[00:09:49] like red or black okay and he said black
[00:09:50] immediately you felt compelled to say
[00:09:52] black that's a chance I took again it's
[00:09:54] not 100% but it does you know increase
[00:09:56] my odds okay and then I said same thing
[00:09:59] I said okay clubs or space Ranu my
[00:10:02] spades naturally spades right and then
[00:10:05] because it was a nine there's a
[00:10:07] principle in magic that doesn't always
[00:10:10] work but uh you know now that I've said
[00:10:12] it wouldn't work but look here right so
[00:10:16] name it number seed 0:20 quickly
[00:10:19] right it's literally what he whispered
[00:10:23] to me so it works with when you get when
[00:10:27] you get you have it that's a gimmick you
[00:10:28] guys set that up yeah but he doesn't he
[00:10:31] doesn't know we got times genuinely not
[00:10:33] in on it but that works sort of with
[00:10:35] everybody it's just like a psychological
[00:10:38] subtlety where first of all my hands go
[00:10:42] you number between 0 and 20 yeah and
[00:10:45] just 20 like 20 right so I'm up here
[00:10:48] right so you're thinking up here you
[00:10:49] don't wanna give me 20 cuz I just said
[00:10:51] it right you know want to say zero cuz I
[00:10:52] just said it so those are like that's
[00:10:54] like eliminating things without you even
[00:10:56] realizing it yeah cuz like I said think
[00:10:58] of a color for instance if you were to
[00:11:00] think of green you would think of grass
[00:11:01] or something right so think of a call
[00:11:02] you're not gonna think of green right I
[00:11:04] just eliminated right without saying
[00:11:06] right so if you said just over between
[00:11:09] 20 and zero right you probably do around
[00:11:12] three or two
[00:11:13] yeah correct it's not the you want to go
[00:11:15] if you're if you don't have a chance to
[00:11:18] think about it
[00:11:18] if you dwell on it too long you're gonna
[00:11:21] it's not gonna count yes it's gonna be
[00:11:22] zero twenty going immediately sixteen
[00:11:24] seventeen eighteen come to mind right
[00:11:25] yeah so because was a nine if I woulda
[00:11:28] said zero and ten you would have said
[00:11:29] six or seven yeah
[00:11:31] thirteen is perfect is there's thirteen
[00:11:32] cards to every suit so I said between
[00:11:34] zero and thirteen hoping you were gonna
[00:11:36] go for eight or nine if you woulda went
[00:11:39] eight it would've still been like oh
[00:11:40] it's a nine but else it would have been
[00:11:42] it would have been great the fact that
[00:11:43] you hit it was really great and I'm glad
[00:11:45] we got it on camera too okay that's
[00:11:48] awesome
[00:11:48] anyways thanks dude thanks in sharing
[00:11:50] there with me yeah please like subscribe
[00:11:52] share the video and I'll see you in the
[00:11:54] next video

=== Q & A #2 (2019) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5B7R3TDFPs

[00:00:00] do you tend to try to remember
[00:00:01] everything I used to but uh then I got
[00:00:07] lazy what's up guys Nelson Dellis here
[00:00:10] it's been a while since I've done a Q&A
[00:00:12] so I figured let's do a QA for 2019
[00:00:17] there's a lot of new members of the memo
[00:00:19] team here new subscribers what's up so I
[00:00:22] figured I might answer some questions
[00:00:24] that a lot of people asked or some weird
[00:00:27] ones that just won't well let's dive
[00:00:29] into it shall we
[00:00:31] [Music]
[00:00:35] all right he's gonna be totally random
[00:00:37] and all over the place just ones that I
[00:00:38] picked that I thought needed some
[00:00:40] answering or just funny ones or
[00:00:41] interesting ones that I thought should
[00:00:43] be addressed so starting with this and
[00:00:46] some of these refer to specific videos
[00:00:47] I'll make it clear what apply your money
[00:00:50] anyways the first one is hey what type
[00:00:52] of note book is that the ink doesn't
[00:00:54] bleed through that is so there's a video
[00:00:55] that I did wear it well actually a few
[00:00:57] videos where I'm writing in a notebook
[00:00:59] I think namely my Morse code 1 and the
[00:01:02] setting goals people were upset that I
[00:01:04] was wasting a whole notebook on that but
[00:01:07] whatever they are Moleskine sketchbook
[00:01:11] ins I buy the pack of three and I'll put
[00:01:14] the link of them in the description
[00:01:16] great stuff
[00:01:17] not too expensive either alright next
[00:01:19] question how is the drops to Kay
[00:01:22] challenge going glad you asked I'll be
[00:01:24] having some update videos coming soon
[00:01:27] so now obviously the the 2k challenge
[00:01:30] learning the 2,000 words
[00:01:32] finished earlier this year now I'm
[00:01:34] working on fluency or basic fluency and
[00:01:37] yeah I take lessons twice a week I speak
[00:01:40] with my mom and it's going well I should
[00:01:44] have an update video soon about how I'm
[00:01:46] speaking at the end of the year that's
[00:01:48] hopefully the goal is to get me to
[00:01:50] really show off what I've learned and
[00:01:52] taught myself in Dutch and I should also
[00:01:55] throw in some videos on how to memorise
[00:01:57] some of the difficulties of language I
[00:02:00] can use some Dutch
[00:02:01] apples like verbs conjugations anyways
[00:02:05] yeah good well thanks for asking all
[00:02:07] right since you trained your memory to
[00:02:09] such a high level do you recall memories
[00:02:11] of events prior to when you started
[00:02:13] memory training better no yeah no yeah I
[00:02:17] don't even remember things better now as
[00:02:19] they're happening as with the memory
[00:02:22] like mine memory is an active process I
[00:02:24] will say though though I will say though
[00:02:27] though my frame of mind is different
[00:02:28] because I'm have a highly trained memory
[00:02:31] so every experience I go into every
[00:02:33] event everything that happens to me I do
[00:02:35] see it through a lens of the Train
[00:02:37] memory guy so that I guess makes it more
[00:02:40] memorable but definitely doesn't make
[00:02:43] things from before that suddenly pop up
[00:02:45] in my memory like I'm a memory champion
[00:02:47] now I remember when I was born nah don't
[00:02:50] remember I was born how do you say look
[00:02:51] at my junk in Dutch so I think this is a
[00:02:56] reference to sometimes I frame my shots
[00:02:58] my videos and I don't realize that it's
[00:03:01] like almost centered on my crotch did I
[00:03:03] sit on the couch sometimes and it's
[00:03:04] pretty low this video no I've got it
[00:03:07] greatly set up you can get even to get
[00:03:09] to see my done my Dutch my done my done
[00:03:12] to my junk my dutch junk yeah I don't
[00:03:16] know the word for junk is but look at my
[00:03:18] is cake and our main look at mine my
[00:03:22] junk I don't know I'd have to look that
[00:03:25] up let's see junk
[00:03:29] Romel okay so Kate can I remain Romel
[00:03:32] yeah
[00:03:34] next question at fifty seconds into the
[00:03:37] specific video what do you tell yourself
[00:03:39] before starting the memorization so I
[00:03:40] did a 30 minute Pomodoro session and you
[00:03:43] can see memorizing numbers and I think
[00:03:46] what he's talking about is right before
[00:03:47] I memorize the numbers I close my eyes I
[00:03:49] kind of get myself together so that's
[00:03:51] exactly what I'm doing I don't really
[00:03:53] tell myself anything I just kind of
[00:03:54] Center myself calm myself down take a
[00:03:58] few breaths situate myself inside the
[00:04:01] memory palace I'm about to use at the
[00:04:03] starting point so I'm ready to go do a
[00:04:05] few breaths calm down and then I go
[00:04:07] that's all that's happening how much
[00:04:09] does the altitude change the
[00:04:10] memorization so I did a posted a video
[00:04:12] of me memorizing cars and Everest that's
[00:04:14] a great question and I could do a whole
[00:04:16] video on that I because I meticulously
[00:04:18] would study and train my memory at
[00:04:20] different altitudes to see the effects
[00:04:22] and back in the day 2011 I was high on
[00:04:26] this finding that actually improved with
[00:04:29] altitude insanely enough and I had my
[00:04:32] own reasons for that but uh I would say
[00:04:35] doesn't really if you're using memory
[00:04:38] techniques what did affect me is I was
[00:04:40] tired so sometimes I'd just be so
[00:04:42] exhausted that I couldn't even focus on
[00:04:44] anything and my memory would be bad but
[00:04:46] the heightened sense of where I was and
[00:04:48] being so removed from everything made my
[00:04:50] imagination and therefore memory much
[00:04:54] more powerful right can you do more
[00:04:56] videos as this yeah sure always trying
[00:05:00] to do more videos as this I think
[00:05:02] specifically is talking about the video
[00:05:03] where I teach you something as I'm
[00:05:06] learning it I think I did that for the
[00:05:08] alphanumeric pilot code I was doing it
[00:05:11] live and I think people really enjoy
[00:05:13] that so definitely I have a few videos
[00:05:15] in the pipeline that have me learning it
[00:05:17] as I go through the video I think it's a
[00:05:19] fun experience for everybody watching to
[00:05:20] see how I go about it my first time
[00:05:23] second time through I love the video but
[00:05:25] also did anyone else notice the
[00:05:26] pregnancy books in the background yeah I
[00:05:29] am not pregnant
[00:05:30] I just caused the kick but my wife was
[00:05:35] pregnant and we had a baby so
[00:05:38] pregnancy books are very helpful not for
[00:05:41] memory but for from remembering how to
[00:05:44] take every baby I guess do you still use
[00:05:46] pa-o system in memorizing cards and
[00:05:48] numbers hmm no sort of not really
[00:05:52] complicated how many sites do you have
[00:05:55] in your individual mind okay I think
[00:05:56] that's how many memory palace locations
[00:05:58] do I have hundreds thousands I have
[00:06:00] hundreds of memory palaces each have a
[00:06:03] varying amount of locations so
[00:06:05] definitely thousands some are longer
[00:06:08] like for numbers when I memorize more
[00:06:10] numbers some are shorter like for cards
[00:06:12] they don't have to be very long to
[00:06:13] memorize a whole deck of cards and then
[00:06:14] I have other ones for just whatever
[00:06:16] comes my way for memorizing words binary
[00:06:20] whatever so I have thousands of
[00:06:22] locations how do you do it at such a
[00:06:24] high speed though because I can pretty
[00:06:25] much do the memory palace thing but it
[00:06:27] takes a rather what long time any advice
[00:06:29] yeah I totally get it and I was the same
[00:06:32] way it's practice that's it and make
[00:06:34] sure that these memory palaces are
[00:06:36] familiar to you you know them very well
[00:06:39] that's it makes perfect it does actually
[00:06:41] does I believe it or not they say that
[00:06:44] all time but it's true curious how you
[00:06:46] think this might work for individuals
[00:06:47] with working memory issues do you have
[00:06:49] any knowledge of this yeah a little bit
[00:06:51] I've worked with some people who have
[00:06:53] had brain injuries or people with
[00:06:56] dementia and to varying degrees this
[00:06:59] stuff works definitely better than no
[00:07:01] memory techniques at all but I think it
[00:07:03] kind of depends can you learn something
[00:07:05] new first of all can you understand what
[00:07:06] I'm teaching you and once you can get
[00:07:09] past that I think a lot of people can
[00:07:11] use these techniques and that's where
[00:07:12] the benefit lies for a lot of people who
[00:07:14] have limitations on their their brain or
[00:07:17] so they think these techniques would
[00:07:19] help them get a lot further how much
[00:07:20] time per day did you use drops over the
[00:07:22] 90-day period a lot three four hours a
[00:07:27] day just mostly because I had to go
[00:07:29] through all the words and that's I can
[00:07:31] only go so fast as the software lets me
[00:07:33] but in terms of review I don't really
[00:07:35] need that much playing it and learning
[00:07:37] new words was enough to kind of get
[00:07:39] things going but I'd say a few
[00:07:41] hours a day it was fun I didn't mind it
[00:07:43] ten Elson I was wondering if you had any
[00:07:45] specific tips on how to get faster when
[00:07:47] memorizing a deck of cards or if it's
[00:07:48] practice practice practice see my answer
[00:07:51] a few questions ago
[00:07:52] practice makes perfect practice makes
[00:07:54] perfect practice makes perfect
[00:07:56] let's practice my friend I was wondering
[00:07:57] where you get your randomizing America
[00:07:59] lists for memory practice do you have a
[00:08:02] resource you can share or do you simply
[00:08:04] make your own on a text editor I
[00:08:06] actually make my own use Mathematica
[00:08:09] which is a programming suite I just code
[00:08:12] it and I generate my own numbers so that
[00:08:14] they look exactly like the ones at Euler
[00:08:16] the US championship or the world memory
[00:08:18] championship if you'd like some some of
[00:08:21] you know I'll send you something do you
[00:08:23] tend to try to remember everything no I
[00:08:27] used to when I first got into this that
[00:08:29] I was obsessed I love this stuff I
[00:08:31] thought it was a coolest thing I wanted
[00:08:32] to apply it to everything but uh then I
[00:08:35] got lazy now I only memorize or try to
[00:08:37] memorize when I'm actually competing on
[00:08:40] YouTube idk when but soon I hope so I
[00:08:44] mean recently I just had a miniature
[00:08:46] blow up kind of doubled my numbers but I
[00:08:49] would love to get 100k that's my
[00:08:51] ultimate goal and then I will quit
[00:08:53] YouTube and be happy
[00:08:54] hi would you memorize maps it's coming I
[00:08:56] have a good one coming up on that who in
[00:08:58] your mind is the world's greatest
[00:08:59] climber I'm going with Messner I'd have
[00:09:01] to agree with you Reinhold Messner
[00:09:04] legend Chilean Draenei Ueli Steck this
[00:09:07] guy names who I've never heard of before
[00:09:08] until this year he's climbing all 14
[00:09:10] eight-thousanders Peaks and I think 7
[00:09:13] months or something like that it's
[00:09:14] absolutely insane you got to check out
[00:09:16] his stuff in the description what keeps
[00:09:17] you motivated
[00:09:20] that's a soul-searching question man
[00:09:22] sometimes I don't know I find it hard to
[00:09:25] find that sometimes but I do want my
[00:09:27] fifth title that's me motivates me like
[00:09:29] no other so as long as I have that I'm
[00:09:32] gonna keep going
[00:09:33] Hank Scorpio I didn't know what that was
[00:09:36] I have to look it up what do you think
[00:09:38] yeah maybe
[00:09:40] is it just me or does it look like van
[00:09:42] Gogh yeah except God my ears fun fact
[00:09:44] actually wasn't and go for Halloween
[00:09:46] once saw you got a lot of these from
[00:09:48] Vsauce cool if you got credited this is
[00:09:51] the Morse code video Vsauce does the
[00:09:53] Morse code video true I covered
[00:09:55] something that he doesn't at all and
[00:09:57] even the the sound mnemonics that I use
[00:10:00] you can invent them they're on Wikipedia
[00:10:03] so and actually I didn't use the same
[00:10:05] ones he did some of them were the Sam
[00:10:06] anyways
[00:10:07] I mean I love this video did it make it
[00:10:10] because of him but you just haven't had
[00:10:11] to Morse code videos 221 am so
[00:10:14] apparently YouTube recommends my Morse
[00:10:17] code video the one that got a lot of
[00:10:18] views to people really early in the
[00:10:20] morning 404 a.m. 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. 4:14
[00:10:23] a.m. 304 a.m. 2:16 a.m. 321 a.m. 360
[00:10:27] a.m. the hell that's it for this video
[00:10:30] hope I answered some fun questions
[00:10:32] something interesting I'll do another
[00:10:33] one of these probably next year and in
[00:10:35] the meantime if you haven't subscribed
[00:10:37] yet I don't know what's going on better
[00:10:39] do that right now anyways see you in the
[00:10:40] next one I'm out
[00:10:42] [Music]


=== MEMORIZE A RECIPE using GOODFELLAS (Movie Palace Technique) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j9BQySuFAo

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:10] there's this super famous scene in
[00:00:13] Goodfellas where Polly is in prison and
[00:00:15] he's preparing part of the meal slicing
[00:00:17] garlic super thin like with a razor
[00:00:20] blade thing it's always stuck with me
[00:00:23] because I always used to put garlic peel
[00:00:25] press now according to Anthony Bourdain
[00:00:28] misuse of garlic is a crime
[00:00:31] don't put it through a press I don't
[00:00:33] know what that junk is that squeezes out
[00:00:35] of the end of those things but it ain't
[00:00:37] garlic shoot guilty now my wife's a big
[00:00:44] fan of Goodfellas with her Italian
[00:00:46] family and all and after watching it the
[00:00:48] other day got me thinking I could use
[00:00:50] this film to memorize something and why
[00:00:54] not memorize a delicious recipe that
[00:00:56] uses legal methods of garlic mutilation
[00:00:58] now since this video is all about movies
[00:01:01] and cooking I thought why not learn one
[00:01:03] of my favorite on-screen cook dishes
[00:01:05] Aglio olio I mean look at scar Joe's
[00:01:08] face right here wouldn't you want to try
[00:01:10] that pasta too I always talk about using
[00:01:12] actual places for memory palaces to
[00:01:14] store lists of things you don't know
[00:01:16] what a memory palaces check out this
[00:01:17] video right now but it doesn't always
[00:01:19] have to be an actual place you can
[00:01:21] actually use scenes from a movie
[00:01:23] to memorize those same things yeah
[00:01:26] movies anyways the recipe is insanely
[00:01:28] simple basically got six ingredients so
[00:01:31] I thought why not memorize this one
[00:01:32] here's what you'll need 1 head of garlic
[00:01:35] some high quality extra virgin olive oil
[00:01:37] some red pepper flakes a bushel of
[00:01:40] parsley a lemon or two and some pasta
[00:01:43] spaghetti or linguine is fine ok first
[00:01:46] let's talk about memorizing a recipe
[00:01:48] like what do you actually need to know
[00:01:50] and what can you kind of not bother with
[00:01:52] so I guess the idea of knowing a recipe
[00:01:55] is that you could say while you're out
[00:01:56] and about heard I would like to make
[00:01:58] this dish I know what I need and I know
[00:01:59] the steps to make it so that might
[00:02:01] involve you actually going to the
[00:02:02] grocery store remembering what
[00:02:03] ingredients you need or remembering
[00:02:06] whether you already have them and if you
[00:02:08] need to add any of the missing items
[00:02:09] then you obviously need to know the
[00:02:11] steps with the pasta now cut this out
[00:02:14] it's the sauce whatever
[00:02:16] okay hold on just a couple things to
[00:02:19] keep in mind this is not the only way to
[00:02:21] memorize a recipe in fact it may not
[00:02:24] even be the best way I'm just using it
[00:02:25] as an example to highlight this memory
[00:02:28] palace or movie Palace
[00:02:30] technique that I'm explaining another
[00:02:32] thing you can use any movie it does not
[00:02:35] have to be Goodfellas in fact if you've
[00:02:38] never seen Goodfellas or you're not that
[00:02:40] familiar with it then it's probably the
[00:02:42] worst movie you can use you want to use
[00:02:43] movies that are familiar to you you know
[00:02:46] and a lot of people have really close
[00:02:47] emotions or connections to films they
[00:02:49] make a feel good to make them laugh give
[00:02:51] you memories so that's why I'm talking
[00:02:53] about using them but only if they do
[00:02:55] that to you
[00:02:56] I like Goodfellas I watched it recently
[00:02:58] it means something in the context of
[00:03:00] making garlicky pasta so I thought it
[00:03:01] made sense one more thing you'll notice
[00:03:03] that sometimes I'll use parts of the
[00:03:06] scene like a specific frame that stuck
[00:03:08] out of my mind as the place we're on a
[00:03:10] place an image or I'll use the general
[00:03:12] idea of scene or I'll play the scene
[00:03:14] completely out doesn't really matter you
[00:03:16] have the flexibility of using either
[00:03:18] just do whatever you feel is memorable
[00:03:20] about that scene and lastly you should
[00:03:22] know this movie really well like scene
[00:03:24] for scene that's what this whole
[00:03:26] technique hinges on is that you know
[00:03:28] this film so well that you have a good
[00:03:30] idea of the order of scenes now I'm not
[00:03:32] saying you need to know every single
[00:03:34] scene of the movie in order but usually
[00:03:36] with movies that you know very well you
[00:03:37] know it starts with this opening scene
[00:03:39] and then there's this scene and that's
[00:03:41] even more or less you know the structure
[00:03:43] of this film that structure is what's
[00:03:45] going to keep the order of the
[00:03:46] information or trying to memorize in
[00:03:47] this case the steps of the recipe got it
[00:03:50] okay back to editing here
[00:03:54] all right the first thing we're gonna
[00:03:56] use is the intro if you remember from
[00:03:58] the film is basically three wise guys
[00:04:01] Goodfellas whatever they're driving in
[00:04:03] the car they hear a thumping in the
[00:04:04] trunk
[00:04:05] today it's something pull over open it
[00:04:07] isn't not quite yet
[00:04:09] dead body and they go ahead and kill the
[00:04:12] guy again so we'll use that scene all
[00:04:16] right to remember the most important
[00:04:18] part of our recipe ingredients right the
[00:04:20] six things and then kind of how much you
[00:04:22] need a beach so when I'm thinking about
[00:04:23] this I might think of the actual car
[00:04:26] that they're in so instead of ray
[00:04:27] Liotta's head all right this is gonna
[00:04:29] get weird but instead of ray Liotta's
[00:04:31] head let's imagine the garlic I need so
[00:04:34] I need a half head of garlic that's how
[00:04:37] much it when you use for the actual
[00:04:38] recipe half of his head is actually a
[00:04:42] garlic bulb then next to him in the
[00:04:44] passenger seat up front is Robert De
[00:04:46] Niro so let's imagine that we pour olive
[00:04:49] oil all over him and he's like gets
[00:04:52] really upset about it and that Robert De
[00:04:54] Niro kind of way and we need to remember
[00:04:56] that it's a half cup so just imagine
[00:04:59] literally he's got a cup half full or
[00:05:02] half empty then in the backseat we have
[00:05:04] Joe Pesci and the next ingredient is red
[00:05:06] pepper flakes
[00:05:07] one teaspoon and you can add more if you
[00:05:10] like I don't know how you like being
[00:05:12] spicy but for me one teaspoon is spicy
[00:05:14] enough so I'm just gonna imagine taking
[00:05:15] a little teaspoon and you take it you
[00:05:17] fill it with red pepper flakes and you
[00:05:19] just toss it into filled Pesci's eyes
[00:05:21] and it's just burnt you can hear him
[00:05:22] cursing the living daylights out of you
[00:05:24] in a very Joe Pesci way right all right
[00:05:29] now we have three more items let's
[00:05:30] finish it up so imagine that they pull
[00:05:31] over and they pop open the trunk inside
[00:05:33] of the trunk we see a dead guy or almost
[00:05:36] dead guy and his head is a big bushel of
[00:05:38] parsley bright green dead body with a
[00:05:41] bunch of blood all over it and for a
[00:05:42] head there's a green head of parsley now
[00:05:45] that's when Joe Pesci comes in and
[00:05:46] starts stabbing him to make sure he's
[00:05:48] dead so instead imagine who's holding
[00:05:49] lemons just squirting it all over the
[00:05:51] body and again depends how much lemon
[00:05:53] flavor you like but I find that if it's
[00:05:55] a juicy lemon one lemon is good enough
[00:05:58] if it's one of those hard to squeeze not
[00:06:00] much juice comes out of it lemons and
[00:06:01] two is good and then finally you gotta
[00:06:03] have the pasta right it's a pasta dish
[00:06:05] so let's imagine that
[00:06:06] you know after they pull over make sure
[00:06:08] the bodies dead they got to dump it and
[00:06:10] they dig a hole right they start putting
[00:06:11] the body in there
[00:06:12] imagine dumping all this pasta inside
[00:06:15] that dug hole and that's it first scene
[00:06:18] we have all the ingredients we know that
[00:06:20] we need half head of garlic 1/2 cup of
[00:06:23] olive oil 1 teaspoon of red pepper
[00:06:25] flakes bushel or a head of parsley then
[00:06:28] our two lemons acosta all right now our
[00:06:32] second scene okay is a classic
[00:06:34] Goodfellas scene and it's the one where
[00:06:36] Joe Pesci goes off on Ray Liotta they're
[00:06:40] laughing about some joke in their club
[00:06:42] and Ray Liotta just keeps laughing and
[00:06:44] under his breath says ah man you're so
[00:06:46] funny
[00:06:46] and Joe Pesci is like I'm funny how I'm
[00:06:48] a funny like I'm a clown am you so I'm
[00:06:50] gonna use that moment in time to
[00:06:52] remember the first step of our recipe
[00:06:55] and this this step is pretty easy I'm
[00:06:57] sure most of you out there who have ever
[00:06:58] cooked a pasta meal have done this and
[00:07:00] that is to boil water add some salt cook
[00:07:03] the pasta and that's it before you start
[00:07:05] anything you want to get this pasta
[00:07:06] going and what's important to remember
[00:07:08] though is that you want to cook it
[00:07:09] slightly al dente so don't make it too
[00:07:11] soft you want to take it out of the
[00:07:13] water before it gets completely cooked
[00:07:16] because you're gonna cook it a little
[00:07:17] bit in the pan and this is also
[00:07:19] important to save a quarter cup of the
[00:07:21] pasta water so we have Joe Pesci kind of
[00:07:24] giving really Oda a hard time he's
[00:07:26] surrounded by his other Italian goon
[00:07:28] henchmen so let's imagine that as he's
[00:07:30] saying mi clown do I amuse you that he's
[00:07:33] got a big pot of pasta water cooking
[00:07:36] he's sprinkling some salt as he says
[00:07:38] that and then he adds the pasta if you
[00:07:40] were to help remember that it's al dente
[00:07:42] maybe imagine that he gets so angry at
[00:07:45] Ray Liotta that he takes the pasta out
[00:07:47] and he's able to hit him with it because
[00:07:49] it's still pretty hard and now that last
[00:07:51] part again it turns out that Joe Pesci
[00:07:53] is just messing around with him and they
[00:07:56] laugh it off saying I'm just messing
[00:07:57] with you
[00:07:59] and as it at that point maybe he takes a
[00:08:01] quarter puts it in a cup of pasta water
[00:08:04] and hands it to ray liotta as a sign of
[00:08:07] good faith all right this next scene
[00:08:12] also a classic it's often known as
[00:08:15] Steadicam scene why because it starts
[00:08:18] off on the streets
[00:08:19] it's Ray Liotta and his girlfriend it
[00:08:21] follows them all through the club at the
[00:08:23] Copacabana through the kitchen passing
[00:08:25] all of his friends you know skipping
[00:08:27] along the way and then they get a seat
[00:08:28] inside the actual club and it's this one
[00:08:31] continuous shot anyways for me what
[00:08:33] sticks out is kind of the part where
[00:08:35] they go through the kitchen there's a
[00:08:36] lot of crazy stuff going on and the
[00:08:38] kitchen kind of applies to cooking right
[00:08:40] so the next step while you have your
[00:08:42] pasta going it's almost done I'd say
[00:08:44] you're gonna start doing this in a large
[00:08:46] saute pan add your olive oil and start
[00:08:49] cooking it on medium now this is
[00:08:51] important don't friggin blast the heat
[00:08:53] on this thing you're gonna ruin the next
[00:08:55] step so make sure that you cook the
[00:08:57] olive oil on medium heat and notice when
[00:09:00] it starts to shimmer that's when you're
[00:09:02] gonna move on to the next step how do we
[00:09:03] remember this okay so let's imagine that
[00:09:05] Ray Liotta is walking through the
[00:09:07] kitchen and he slips on some olive oil
[00:09:10] it's just covered in olive oil all
[00:09:12] throughout the kitchen because somebody
[00:09:14] added it to the floor to a medium heat
[00:09:17] so you could just try to add that to the
[00:09:18] picture that it's not too hot it's
[00:09:20] shimmering it's a little shiny and
[00:09:22] medium heat that's it all right here's
[00:09:24] the next scene I call it the pistol-whip
[00:09:26] scene
[00:09:27] it's where Ray Liotta goes across the
[00:09:29] street through his wife or girlfriends
[00:09:31] neighbor who apparently roughhouser and
[00:09:33] he beats the living crap out of him with
[00:09:36] a pistol right on this driveway anyway
[00:09:38] so the next step is to add our garlic
[00:09:40] now during the prep obviously there's
[00:09:42] some prep to this recipe you got half
[00:09:44] the lemon you got to cut the garlic you
[00:09:46] got to cut the parsley now for the
[00:09:48] garlic remember it's got to be razor
[00:09:51] thin that's the whole point of this
[00:09:52] video okay so make sure you that you've
[00:09:54] done that beforehand it takes a little
[00:09:56] bit of time you can use a razor blade
[00:09:57] you can use a very thin knife but take
[00:09:59] your time that's what makes this dish
[00:10:01] delicious anyways at this point you're
[00:10:03] gonna add that garlic to the olive oil
[00:10:05] that's somewhat hot again it does not
[00:10:08] need to be hot hot hot because your
[00:10:11] garlic will burn
[00:10:12] and then the dish is ruined nobody likes
[00:10:14] burned garlic smells disgusting tastes
[00:10:16] disgusting make sure that kind of cooks
[00:10:19] slowly not too hot and you want it
[00:10:21] slightly browned so imagine instead of a
[00:10:24] pistol he's using to beat the crap out
[00:10:26] of this guy imagine it's all the garlic
[00:10:27] right and he's just hitting the guy
[00:10:29] until it's slightly brown all right the
[00:10:33] next scene is the shinebox scene I call
[00:10:36] it and this is where Ray Liotta just has
[00:10:38] a new club he opens and there's a maid
[00:10:40] goon guy at the bar and Joe Pesci comes
[00:10:44] in they haven't seen each other in a
[00:10:45] while basically but the guy insults Joe
[00:10:53] Pesci and does not take you well let me
[00:10:57] get your shine box all right the next
[00:11:03] step in your recipe is to add the red
[00:11:05] pepper flakes there's no special thing
[00:11:07] to that you already have it as a
[00:11:09] teaspoon you're just gonna toss it into
[00:11:10] the saute pan mix it around and then as
[00:11:13] soon as you got that mixed in take
[00:11:15] everything off the heat you don't want
[00:11:17] that garlic to cook anymore so let's
[00:11:18] imagine that this guy is talking about
[00:11:20] the shoe-shining he's making fun of Joe
[00:11:23] Pesci and since we did this before we
[00:11:25] threw red pepper flakes into Joe Pesci's
[00:11:27] eyes and he cursed about it so imagine
[00:11:29] this other mouth guy throws a teaspoon
[00:11:31] of red peppers into his face that brings
[00:11:33] it all back together the next scene is
[00:11:36] the pasta scene where they're cooking in
[00:11:39] prison and the next step is to add the
[00:11:42] pasta to the actual pan along with that
[00:11:45] quarter cup of pasta water
[00:11:47] so imagine makes sense in this pasta
[00:11:49] dish they're cooking at some point they
[00:11:51] got to put the pasta into the pan you
[00:11:53] can remember the pasta water
[00:11:55] you know paulie's gonna put in some
[00:11:56] pasta water into the dish as well the
[00:11:59] next scene is gonna be the scene where
[00:12:01] Pesci gets basically whacked sorry for
[00:12:04] the spoiler the step in the recipe is to
[00:12:06] add the parsley add the lemon toss to
[00:12:08] combine so imagine that Barry is lying
[00:12:11] on the floor and they squirt some lemon
[00:12:13] and pour some parsley over him to cover
[00:12:15] his body that's it all right and finally
[00:12:19] the last scene is gonna be at the end
[00:12:21] where Ray Liotta flips and he's
[00:12:23] basically on this
[00:12:25] and pointing out ratting out his guys so
[00:12:27] that he can go to witness protection so
[00:12:29] the last step and this is kind of a
[00:12:31] bonus makes sense it's not too hard to
[00:12:33] remember with anything you cook that's
[00:12:35] to add salt and pepper to taste
[00:12:37] you can have some Parmesan cheese if you
[00:12:39] like that or not it tastes good with or
[00:12:41] without just imagine that he's sitting
[00:12:42] on the stand sprinkling some salt and
[00:12:45] pepper and maybe even shaving some parm
[00:12:48] throwing them some shade that's how the
[00:12:53] method works guys it's not too hard take
[00:12:55] a bunch of scenes from a movie and order
[00:12:56] and place images for the things you want
[00:12:58] to remember onto them in this case I use
[00:13:00] a recipe that I love and hopefully you
[00:13:02] love to it's the easiest recipe to
[00:13:04] remember try it it is delicious
[00:13:06] now if you're watching my videos there's

[00:00:14] Charlie we're gonna be doing some state
[00:00:17] high points that are in the New York
[00:00:19] area specifically we're doing
[00:00:20] Connecticut which is where we are Rhode
[00:00:22] Island and then Mass all in one single

[00:03:53] YouTube's filled with incredible drone
[00:03:55] shots epic moments but sometimes you
[00:04:00] don't have to have an epic moment to
[00:04:01] have a crazy or fun little memorable
[00:04:05] adventure right you'll always have to go
[00:04:07] some at this peak some at that peak
[00:04:08] granted we did some of the peak but you
[00:04:11] know doesn't always have to be that way

[00:05:00] on the road mostly more than anything
[00:05:01] but we're done and we're gonna head back
[00:05:04] down and that's it I'm just kind of a
[00:05:07] little point I wanted to make and that
[00:05:09] it's okay to not do these insane things
[00:05:12] just to live up to the hype that you see
[00:05:14] on Instagram or YouTube it's okay to
[00:05:17] just do these micro adventures I call
[00:05:19] them where you just have a plan
[00:05:21] something kind of out there or something
[00:05:24] that you just want to accomplish and you
[00:05:25] just go and get it done no matter how
[00:05:28] small or unimportant it may seem and
[00:05:30] maybe how unposted it may seem to the
[00:05:34] world out there even though I'm posting
[00:05:36] about this right now
[00:05:37] I don't give a crap it was a memorable
[00:05:39] day for me I spent time with my friend I
[00:05:41] did a couple things that I wanted to do
[00:05:43] that were on my personal bucket list and
[00:05:45] I'm happy because of it it was a great
[00:05:47] day can't be ashamed of that that's
[00:05:49] that's all you want it's not about
[00:05:50] trying to impress people it's just about
[00:05:53] living your own life and making the best
[00:05:57] of the time that you're given maybe
[00:05:59] that's the point of this video
[00:06:00] especially considering that in the past
[00:06:02] few weeks my youtube channel has kind of
[00:06:04] made a big jump unsuspectingly I don't
[00:06:06] know why but it's great and thank you
[00:06:08] all for subscribing but you know there's
[00:06:10] almost kind of this pressure to perform
[00:06:12] and to make something better and bigger
[00:06:14] but you know at the end of it just gotta
[00:06:16] make something that makes you happy and
[00:06:18] do things that make you happy and I
[00:06:20] think that's hopefully what comes across
[00:06:22] best that's the content quality for you
[00:06:24] guys I hope so but yeah don't get caught
[00:06:27] up in that stuff I try not to not always
[00:06:30] successful but I try not to thanks for

=== 4 BOOKS THAT CHANGED MY LIFE ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fkFDlTQIA

[00:00:03] [Music]
[00:00:17] what's up everyone Nelson Dellis here
[00:00:20] and in this video we're gonna talk about
[00:00:21] three well four books really that
[00:00:25] changed my life completely you want to
[00:00:27] know what they are might not be what you
[00:00:29] think let's get into it so over the
[00:00:34] years I've had an interesting journey
[00:00:36] getting to a place where I can call
[00:00:38] myself a memory champion I mean ten
[00:00:42] years ago I would have never thought
[00:00:43] that that would be the person I am today
[00:00:46] there are plenty of books that I've read
[00:00:48] that have changed me a little bit but
[00:00:50] I'd say these are the four that really
[00:00:52] broke me down to the heart and really
[00:00:55] inspired me in a way to do something or
[00:00:58] change something or go about something
[00:01:00] differently
[00:01:02] so the first book here into thin air by
[00:01:06] Jon Krakauer is a classic and many of
[00:01:10] you out there have read into the New
[00:01:11] York Times bestseller and basically it
[00:01:14] recounts the tragic events of the 1996
[00:01:17] climbing season on Mount Everest
[00:01:20] it was titillating to brush up against
[00:01:22] the enigma of mortality to steal the
[00:01:25] glimpse across its forbidden frontier
[00:01:26] climbing was a magnificent activity I
[00:01:29] firmly believed not in spite of the
[00:01:31] inherent perils but precisely because of
[00:01:33] them now for me though that wasn't
[00:01:36] really why I wanted to read this I was
[00:01:38] fascinated by the idea of climbing in
[00:01:42] the mountains how was it and I had no
[00:01:45] knowledge I was a complete noob I had no
[00:01:48] idea what it took for what it was about
[00:01:49] but I knew that I liked mountains and
[00:01:52] this was the first book that allowed me
[00:01:54] to explore that and see what the extreme
[00:01:57] end of that was and you know I read this
[00:02:01] I learned about what it takes to go on a
[00:02:03] really long mountain expedition and then
[00:02:06] what it's like at the top of the world
[00:02:08] I just couldn't fathom it but I knew
[00:02:10] that after I read this that I was onto
[00:02:12] something and something that got within
[00:02:14] my very core told me that I needed to go
[00:02:19] climb a mountain maybe not this one but
[00:02:21] some mountain I wanted to feel that and
[00:02:23] because of that I think I learned
[00:02:25] valuable lessons about what it means to
[00:02:28] push yourself and difficult painful
[00:02:31] situations not just sitting on the
[00:02:33] mountains but in life and to get to any
[00:02:36] goal use the metaphor to the mountain it
[00:02:39] takes one step at a time
[00:02:40] and sometimes these steps can be slow
[00:02:43] and arduous but if you set one small
[00:02:46] goal after the other you put your head
[00:02:48] down
[00:02:50] there
[00:02:51] now my second book and a lot of you
[00:02:53] might be shocked by this because you'd
[00:02:55] expect it to be maybe a different memory
[00:02:57] book but to be honest this is one of the
[00:02:59] first memory books I ever picked up your
[00:03:02] memory how it works and how to improve
[00:03:03] it and I can it take me of course it's a
[00:03:06] great memory book with all the
[00:03:07] traditional fixins if you will talking
[00:03:10] about imagery different systems to
[00:03:13] memorize numbers lists of words things
[00:03:15] like that you have probably heard the
[00:03:17] saying that you can't teach an old dog
[00:03:19] new tricks actually there is another
[00:03:21] saying that is probably more accurate
[00:03:23] but it's not quite as well known the
[00:03:25] quickest way to become an old dog is to
[00:03:27] quit learning new tricks but I remember
[00:03:29] reading it and wanting more right and
[00:03:33] because I wanted more that's what led me
[00:03:35] to actually find probably the book that
[00:03:37] I would recommend the most existed an
[00:03:43] audio CD form and that was quantum
[00:03:46] memory power by Dominic O'Brien a time
[00:03:48] world memory champion and so because of
[00:03:51] this book first got me thinking about
[00:03:54] hey I can actually improve my memory and
[00:03:56] because this I was able to get a book
[00:03:59] from a world champion that led me to
[00:04:00] compete in memory championships now I
[00:04:03] have a whole collection of memory books
[00:04:05] I'm probably gonna do a separate video
[00:04:06] on my favorite memory books and that'll
[00:04:09] be a fun one but for now this is really
[00:04:11] the one that got me started
[00:04:16] now let's get to this monster of a book
[00:04:18] I love this book Colonel Usher in Bock
[00:04:21] an eternal golden braid by Douglas
[00:04:23] Hofstadter now and missus
[00:04:25] this pretty much sums it up exactly what
[00:04:27] it is perfectly a metaphorical view on
[00:04:30] minds and machines in the spirit of
[00:04:33] Lewis Carroll make you want to read it
[00:04:37] of course I'm a terminator there was a
[00:04:39] time of my life I was studying physics I
[00:04:41] was convinced I was gonna go to space I
[00:04:43] was gonna be an astronaut an
[00:04:44] astrophysicist I was on my way to
[00:04:46] getting my PhD in physics when I came
[00:04:49] across this book I don't know where I
[00:04:51] heard about it don't know who showed it
[00:04:53] to me but I found it and I was hooked I
[00:04:56] read every single page over and over
[00:05:00] again if there was just so much in this
[00:05:02] book that resonated with me and inspired
[00:05:04] me and it was the right book at the
[00:05:06] right time because it led me to question
[00:05:09] the mind and with physics I was more
[00:05:12] questioning the world and I realized
[00:05:14] that I was more interested in what was
[00:05:15] happening in here and so this led me to
[00:05:18] switch my studies completely to computer
[00:05:20] science Douglas Hofstadter was a
[00:05:22] computer scientist and he was deep into
[00:05:24] artificial intelligence and he was
[00:05:26] really really clever in how he thought
[00:05:28] about how the mind works and how to
[00:05:30] replicate it in machines I just love it
[00:05:32] it weaves together
[00:05:33] music math science the mind all into one
[00:05:38] incredible fat book and in between these
[00:05:42] chapters there's kind of a little
[00:05:45] dialogue that really feels like you're
[00:05:47] in an Alice in Wonderland story and I
[00:05:49] loved those those just got me thinking
[00:05:50] so deeply about what was possible with
[00:05:54] the mind and I honestly attribute a lot
[00:05:57] of my success in the mental world to
[00:06:00] this book this is kind of where it
[00:06:01] started I don't think I would have read
[00:06:03] my other memory books had it not been
[00:06:05] for this one it's beautiful
[00:06:08] now last but not least my fourth book
[00:06:12] believe it or not is not moonwalking
[00:06:14] with Einstein Oh a lot of memory peeps
[00:06:16] out there claimed this to be their first
[00:06:19] book that got them into the world of
[00:06:21] memory sports but not me I am an old man
[00:06:24] and this book actually did not exist
[00:06:26] when I started it took about three years
[00:06:29] of me competing before this book came
[00:06:31] out so this actually didn't mean
[00:06:33] anything to me but no so my fourth book
[00:06:35] and this is kind of hard and
[00:06:38] embarrassing to say and I actually don't
[00:06:40] have the book anymore I don't know where
[00:06:42] it is book is called the game I'm not
[00:06:44] afraid to say it but a bit of shame but
[00:06:46] I bought it at a time in my life when I
[00:06:47] trying to meet people and have I've
[00:06:51] always had a hard time talking to people
[00:06:53] believe it or not as easy as you think
[00:06:55] this is it's a lot easier for me to talk
[00:06:58] to a camera or even to an audience of
[00:07:00] 3,000 people where I can't see specific
[00:07:03] people than it is for me to have a
[00:07:05] one-on-one conversation or a
[00:07:06] conversation with a girl at a bar I was
[00:07:09] having lunch with this guy a friend of
[00:07:11] mine and I recommended moonwalking with
[00:07:13] Einstein I said it would change his life
[00:07:14] and he said well I have a book for you
[00:07:16] let's trade books so we went to the book
[00:07:17] store
[00:07:18] I bought him that one he bought me this
[00:07:19] book the game the game is written by
[00:07:21] Neil Strauss and it's about him kind of
[00:07:25] an awkward writer infiltrating the world
[00:07:27] of pickup artists yeah and learning the
[00:07:32] ways and kind of getting better at
[00:07:35] mastering himself in front of the other
[00:07:37] sex a lot of what I found in that book
[00:07:39] forget about meeting women it was more
[00:07:42] about the psychology of people and
[00:07:45] interactions between people and what
[00:07:47] makes people tick so that you can kind
[00:07:49] of
[00:07:50] work towards that in a conversation in
[00:07:52] life people tend to wait for good things
[00:07:54] to come to them and by waiting bay miss
[00:07:57] out usually what you wish for doesn't
[00:07:59] fall in your lap it falls somewhere
[00:08:00] nearby and you have to recognize it
[00:08:02] stand up and put in the time and work it
[00:08:04] takes to get to it
[00:08:05] this isn't because the universe is cruel
[00:08:07] it's because the universe is smart it
[00:08:09] has its own castering theory and knows
[00:08:12] we don't appreciate things that fall
[00:08:13] into our laps
[00:08:14] I remember you know I was already in the
[00:08:16] memory world but then it kind of gave me
[00:08:18] a lot of confidence out on the speaking
[00:08:20] circuit when I would do speeches when I
[00:08:22] would learn people's names and have to
[00:08:25] memorize them
[00:08:25] now I had such anxiety going up to
[00:08:27] people and having conversations with
[00:08:29] them this book laid it on the floor and
[00:08:31] really gave me some tools and ideas to
[00:08:33] be able to get over that hump I think
[00:08:36] it's a great book to read whether you're
[00:08:37] a man or a woman or neither there's some
[00:08:41] really valuable tips in there you can
[00:08:42] kind of get over the fact that it's
[00:08:44] about picking up women I think there's a
[00:08:47] lot of takeaways outside of that that's
[00:08:49] good all right guys that's all I got for
[00:08:53] you today just wanted to go over a few
[00:08:55] of my really favorite books that mean a
[00:08:57] lot to me and I hope that helps you you
[00:09:00] don't have to read them just know that
[00:09:01] that's kind of where it comes from and
[00:09:02] if you'd like to pick them up I highly
[00:09:05] suggest them if they're great reads
[00:09:07] you'll get a lot out of them I'd love to

=== DUTCH WITH MOM (Drops update part 1) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thu7X-bpYbI

[00:00:08] we Monica what's up everyone Nelson
[00:00:15] Dellis here and I thought in this video
[00:00:17] we could put my language learning to the
[00:00:20] test so for the past 3-4 months I've
[00:00:23] been working on my Dutch name Lee I've
[00:00:26] been using the dropps app to learn over
[00:00:28] 2,000 words in the Dutch language and
[00:00:32] the whole purpose of this was to see if
[00:00:34] I could do it first of all but also so I
[00:00:36] could eventually speak with my mother
[00:00:37] who is from Belgium where they speak
[00:00:40] lumps or Flemish which is basically a
[00:00:43] dialect of Netherlands of Dutch you know
[00:00:46] I've been practicing my words and she's
[00:00:48] gonna go through them and kind of quiz
[00:00:49] me and see how I do and make fun of my
[00:00:52] accent and it should be a fun little
[00:00:55] exercise now
[00:00:56] I also wanted to kind of give it update
[00:00:58] on where that stands so I learned the
[00:01:01] words now what right so the plan was
[00:01:03] always this it was to learn the two
[00:01:05] thousand-plus words in ninety days or so
[00:01:07] which I did now the goal is obviously to
[00:01:10] try and get fluent in the language to a
[00:01:11] point where I can read it write it and
[00:01:13] understand it wherever I go and so to do
[00:01:17] that I'm taking tutoring lessons online
[00:01:18] with a platform called prep lis
[00:01:20] basically doing a lot of studying on my
[00:01:22] own the idea is that drops gave me the
[00:01:24] basics the foundation to kind of
[00:01:26] understand words here and there and now
[00:01:27] I'm gonna spend the rest of the year
[00:01:29] trying to get fluent in Dutch and the

=== HOW TO MEMORIZE EVERYTHING (SEE LINK GO! METHOD) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWE5ea7tdB4

[00:00:02] I'm Nelson knows I'm a four-time USA
[00:00:04] memory champion and welcome to my
[00:00:07] youtube channel now I realize the other
[00:00:09] day that a lot of my videos are very
[00:00:11] specific on how to memorize or learn
[00:00:14] specific things but I don't really have
[00:00:16] the video that describes kind of my
[00:00:18] general formula or plan of attack for
[00:00:21] memorizing absolutely everything and I
[00:00:24] do have one so this video will be
[00:00:26] devoted to that very short very simple
[00:00:29] but basically so you can understand how
[00:00:32] I approach everything that I'd like to
[00:00:34] memorize so I have this three-step
[00:00:36] foolproof process to memorizing anything
[00:00:38] and it starts with what I like to called
[00:00:40] C basically I find a way to picture or
[00:00:44] see the thing that I'm trying to
[00:00:46] memorize in my mind's eye as a picture
[00:00:49] so let's say for example I'm trying to
[00:00:51] memorize my friend's address which
[00:00:53] starts with the number 8 1 2 now when I
[00:00:56] try to see a picture for that number I
[00:00:59] don't want to picture the actual number
[00:01:00] itself that's the whole point is that 8
[00:01:03] 1 2 is not a very memorable number it's
[00:01:05] a bunch of symbols clustered together
[00:01:06] that means nothing to me so I want to
[00:01:09] turn those numbers into something that
[00:01:10] makes sense that I can see in my mind's
[00:01:12] eye
[00:01:13] so instead of seeing 8 1 2 why not try
[00:01:17] to see something like this which is very
[00:01:20] weird but we have an octopus driving one
[00:01:22] car with two wheels right octopuses have
[00:01:25] eight legs this is one pink car pink why
[00:01:29] not and then two tires this car has two
[00:01:32] tires now that is a way to see the
[00:01:34] number eight one two now the second step
[00:01:36] in my process is to do something called
[00:01:38] link which basically means to connect
[00:01:41] the image to something that you already
[00:01:43] know in your head now a great example of
[00:01:45] this is imagine a computer when you save
[00:01:47] a file right you usually give it a file
[00:01:49] name and you put it in the folder why do
[00:01:51] we do that we do that because we need a
[00:01:53] way to find it later by name by location
[00:01:56] we know where it is we know where the
[00:01:58] file is and we can get it out we can
[00:02:00] retrieve it or recall it so the same
[00:02:02] thing needs to happen in our brains we
[00:02:03] need to anchor the image that we saw to
[00:02:06] something that is already firmly planted
[00:02:08] in our brain and we know how to access
[00:02:10] already very easily so this is where the
[00:02:12] Lync idea comes from your linking those
[00:02:14] things together so we want to memorize
[00:02:16] this address we have eight one two we
[00:02:18] have an image already for it now we want
[00:02:20] to link it to something so I'm gonna
[00:02:22] think that ok this person's house that
[00:02:24] it represents the colors of the house
[00:02:27] that it happens to be painted
[00:02:28] reminds me of the planet Earth the
[00:02:30] colors of the ocean and the landmass
[00:02:33] whatever so what I'm gonna do is take my
[00:02:35] image my octopus and attach it to this
[00:02:39] image of the globe which is my link now
[00:02:42] the last step and this is probably the
[00:02:43] most important because it's kind of the
[00:02:45] special sauce the glue that makes it all
[00:02:47] work very nicely that is to do something
[00:02:50] I call NGO which basically takes the
[00:02:52] image that you saw the thing that you're
[00:02:54] linking it to and really smash them
[00:02:56] together give it life give it color give
[00:02:58] it context give it detail reasons why
[00:03:01] this would be the case and really try to
[00:03:03] imagine with all your senses what it
[00:03:05] would be like if it was actually
[00:03:06] happening so we have this octopus on our
[00:03:09] globe but let's imagine he's actually in
[00:03:12] the ocean and on top of that let's
[00:03:13] imagine that there's kids playing nearby
[00:03:15] to playing volleyball and they're sharks
[00:03:17] kind of swimming about the waves that
[00:03:19] are splashing the sounds and the kids
[00:03:21] laughing you could also imagine maybe
[00:03:23] boats are passing by what it would sound
[00:03:24] like for the wind flapping through the
[00:03:26] sails of those different boats and then
[00:03:29] also maybe there's fish flopping about
[00:03:31] right there jumping out of the surface
[00:03:33] of the ocean splashing back in you can
[00:03:35] even smell that fishy smell right and
[00:03:38] maybe even mouth tipless has a few fish
[00:03:40] in its tentacles right ready to eat
[00:03:42] that's the basic process see link go and
[00:03:44] I honestly do that every situation so if
[00:03:47] you want to learn more about what I do
[00:03:48] and how I do it and if you want to reach
[00:03:50] out to me even and send me an email head
[00:03:52] to my website it's Nelson Dellis com and
[00:03:55] also don't forget I have my book called
[00:03:58] remember it should remember it which
[00:04:00] basically talks about all the techniques
[00:04:01] to memorize the day to day stuff that we
[00:04:03] tend to forget and different strategies
[00:04:05] to memorize simple things and the more
[00:04:08] complicated things as well so don't
[00:04:10] forget to check that out that's it for
[00:04:12] this video thanks for watching I'm out
[00:04:15] you
[00:04:22] [Music]


=== KTLA - Nelson Dellis Interview (2019) // Talking Drops app, book, techniques ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqytQwtp-_M

[00:00:00] he travels around the world and competes
[00:00:02] in the world of memory sports
[00:00:04] he holds the title for memorizing the
[00:00:06] most names 235 in 15 minutes
[00:00:10] the most digits 907 in 30 minutes and
[00:00:13] the most decks of cards 9 in 30 minutes
[00:00:17] here to tell us more about this unique
[00:00:18] sport is four-time USA champion Nelson
[00:00:22] Dellis welcome mark can't remember our
[00:00:24] knee there is this world of competitive
[00:00:31] memory sports but what is it how did you
[00:00:33] get into it yeah most people don't it's
[00:00:34] a competition that's pretty quiet
[00:00:36] nowadays but it's growing and it it's a
[00:00:39] day-long event where people come
[00:00:40] together and memorize cards numbers
[00:00:42] names words poetry and I got into it
[00:00:46] because my grandmother had Alzheimer's
[00:00:47] and it was something that I wanted to do
[00:00:50] for myself so that when I got older my
[00:00:52] brain would be healthy and strong and do
[00:00:54] you think it's like a muscle can one
[00:00:56] make one's brain healthy and totally and
[00:00:58] I'm a perfect example because I did not
[00:00:59] have this skill when I was born this is
[00:01:01] something I actively said to myself I
[00:01:02] was gonna learn and practice every day
[00:01:04] and because we were saying how Marilu
[00:01:07] Henner right she's known for remembering
[00:01:09] this is totally different you worked at
[00:01:10] this yeah because I have a terrible
[00:01:12] memory can't remember a thing so how do
[00:01:14] we for others who feel the same way how
[00:01:16] do you train how do you develop it so
[00:01:18] the first thing is to get rid of that
[00:01:20] notion now you have bad memory a lot of
[00:01:22] people fall on that and then I would
[00:01:25] have said the same thing as well about
[00:01:26] myself 10 years ago but I have a great
[00:01:28] memory now and this is something we all
[00:01:31] can learn it's just a different way
[00:01:32] about thinking about how memory works
[00:01:34] and how we should use it and you have a
[00:01:36] book about this and some strategies to
[00:01:38] tell us you want a to strategy so yeah
[00:01:40] so the books called remember it it's
[00:01:42] just a bunch of tips on how to use these
[00:01:44] memory techniques during their daily
[00:01:46] life remembering where you put your car
[00:01:48] keys and names of people you meet and it
[00:01:50] essentially boils down to kind of two
[00:01:53] steps one is turning information into
[00:01:55] pictures so whatever you're trying to
[00:01:56] memorize try to see it as a weird
[00:01:58] over-the-top picture in your head and
[00:02:00] then another step is to connect that
[00:02:02] weird picture to something that you
[00:02:04] already know in your head to make that
[00:02:05] Association and then practice so they
[00:02:08] give us an example like this glass of
[00:02:10] well let's let's use your name you're
[00:02:12] Frank right
[00:02:13] so when I
[00:02:13] you I would think of a word for image
[00:02:16] for the name Frank and I think of like a
[00:02:17] frankfurter that's my picture okay name
[00:02:21] and then I choose something to anchor to
[00:02:24] you about that image and so I noticed
[00:02:26] you're kind of spiky peppery say that
[00:02:33] hot dogs sitting in the top of your hair
[00:02:35] I think pepper hot dogs but I don't say
[00:02:39] it out loud but party you're meeting a
[00:02:42] group of people it's gonna take you you
[00:02:44] know here's Betts okay but this is where
[00:02:47] practice this skill right you can get
[00:02:50] better at it becomes more well-oiled and
[00:02:52] suddenly it's almost okay xual so you
[00:02:54] have an app for people that are
[00:02:57] interested in learning a new language
[00:02:58] and everybody thinks if you don't learn
[00:03:00] in a language when you're a kid forget
[00:03:02] it you have no chance that's not true
[00:03:04] we don't do it yeah it's I'm working on
[00:03:06] that this year my goal is to it uses
[00:03:08] drops app to learn Dutch in one year
[00:03:10] that was just what my mother speaks
[00:03:12] that's roots and the app is great
[00:03:14] because a lot of people have a bit of
[00:03:16] lack of confidence in learning a
[00:03:17] language when they're older and this app
[00:03:19] is really fun to play because it's just
[00:03:21] learning words really gamified every day
[00:03:25] you spend five minutes and learn these
[00:03:26] words and eventually make progress in
[00:03:29] your domain choice all right we want to
[00:03:31] put your memory to the task you actually
[00:03:33] hold the record from memorizing 235
[00:03:36] names in 15 minutes so we feel like we
[00:03:38] should be a piece of cake we gave you
[00:03:39] one and a half minutes to memorize the
[00:03:41] people's names who work here with that
[00:03:43] looking at the screen as we there was a
[00:03:46] list of those names go all right so it
[00:03:48] was Frank Jessica Sam mark Jim Abraham
[00:03:53] Richie Roxanne Marcus Lela Kalina Nancy
[00:03:59] Janet Charlotte's Danielle Lorraine
[00:04:03] Jackie grace Kimberly and Brian oh my
[00:04:06] god so the next thing we did is we gave
[00:04:12] you this deck of cards okay that's right
[00:04:14] good we give it to you I was an hour ago
[00:04:15] I gave you three minutes to do it so I'm
[00:04:19] gonna hold the deck of cards here yeah
[00:04:20] and from the bottom parts yeah Ace of
[00:04:25] Hearts nine
[00:04:27] spades ten of clubs two of hearts Jack
[00:04:31] of Hearts Queen of Hearts Oh three of
[00:04:34] spades eight of clubs King of Spades
[00:04:37] eight of diamonds five of hearts
[00:04:44] four of hearts five of clubs two of
[00:04:48] clubs not one wrong Queen of Spades four
[00:04:52] of spades yeah 8 of spades queen of
[00:04:56] clubs 3 minutes ace of clubs seven of
[00:04:59] clubs
[00:05:02] three of hearts mm-hmm
[00:05:05] king of clubs Ace of Diamonds Jack of
[00:05:09] Diamonds two of spades Jack of Clubs
[00:05:12] eight of Hearts five of diamonds queen
[00:05:17] of diamonds Ace of Spades King of
[00:05:20] Diamonds three of clubs jack of spades
[00:05:25] six of diamonds can he do omens we're
[00:05:28] getting close the diamonds are you
[00:05:30] keeping up yeah yeah okay we're almost
[00:05:32] there six of clubs clubs loves King of
[00:05:40] Hearts
[00:05:41] seven of diamonds then the six of clubs
[00:05:43] yeah three of diamonds two of diamonds
[00:05:47] nine of hearts
[00:05:48] oh my gosh ten of hearts unbelievable
[00:05:50] ten of Spades six of hearts seven of
[00:05:53] hearts seven of spades hang on for one
[00:05:55] thing good and then the last four here
[00:05:59] four of clubs five of spades
[00:06:01] six of spades and ten of diamonds that's
[00:06:13] a bit different I mean there you're not
[00:06:15] memorizing but I'm sure it would
[00:06:16] probably help things that are easy to
[00:06:22] memorize like names as compared to
[00:06:24] numbers or yeah and like cards are hard
[00:06:26] because it's a bunch of symbols same
[00:06:28] with numbers and names can be hard too
[00:06:30] because they can be names you've never
[00:06:32] heard of or complicated names or very
[00:06:34] common names I'd say like learning words
[00:06:37] or things like that are probably the
[00:06:38] easiest but again it's what you practice
[00:06:40] and what
[00:06:40] you put effort in by the way have mostly
[00:06:44] pepper thanks Nelson thank you for more
[00:06:52] information on Nelson at his book titled
[00:06:53] remember it the names of people you meet
[00:06:55] all of your passwords where you left

=== LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8tPkb98Fkk

[00:00:00] (beeping)
[00:00:04] - Can you understand that?
[00:00:05] 'Cause I can't.
[00:00:06] But we're gonna learn
how to do it together.
[00:00:08] I'm gonna teach you how to memorize,
[00:00:10] or learn Morse code in this video.
[00:00:13] Let's do it.
[00:00:14] (snapping)
[00:00:15] (light guitar music)
[00:00:23] So, the story goes that Samuel
Morse was away from his wife,
[00:00:27] and got a letter saying
that she was very sick.
[00:00:29] He immediately went home,
which took him a lot of time,
[00:00:32] and by the time he got home,
[00:00:33] he found out that she had
actually already passed away,
[00:00:36] and was even buried.
[00:00:37] Can you imagine?
[00:00:38] So, he became dead set
[00:00:39] on how to make
communication a lot quicker,
[00:00:43] and subsequently came up with Morse code.
[00:00:45] (energetic music)
[00:00:46] - [Mario] Here we go!
[00:00:48] - What we're gonna do in
this video is figure out
[00:00:50] how to get it in our heads.
[00:00:52] I'm gonna teach you two ways,
[00:00:53] and I'm gonna learn it at the same time.
[00:00:55] One way is just kinda
the quick and dirty way.
[00:00:58] It's not gonna take you very much time,
[00:00:59] and what it'll do
[00:01:00] is it'll put enough
information in your head,
[00:01:01] so that you, along with a piece of paper
[00:01:03] can write out basically
the Morse code chart,
[00:01:06] and from there,
[00:01:07] you could listen to
Morse code, or write it,
[00:01:09] so you would have the chart in your head.
[00:01:11] Now, that's great for
that specific purpose,
[00:01:13] but if you heard Morse code
randomly in a restaurant,
[00:01:15] or an airplane, or wherever you are,
[00:01:17] you would have to quickly
jot out this chart,
[00:01:19] and figure it out.
[00:01:20] Chances are you probably can't do that.
[00:01:21] So, the second version
of memorizing Morse code
[00:01:24] will be how to actually memorize
[00:01:26] what the sounds are for each letter,
[00:01:29] so that if you ever hear Morse code,
[00:01:31] beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,
[00:01:32] you can actually translate
it as it's happening to you,
[00:01:36] which would be pretty cool.
[00:01:37] (light guitar music)
[00:01:39] So, the very basics of Morse code
[00:01:40] is that it's made up of dots and dashes.
[00:01:43] Dot,
[00:01:46] and a dash.
[00:01:47] Now, different combinations
of the dots and the dashes
[00:01:49] will produce different letters,
[00:01:51] and then different
combinations of those letters
[00:01:53] will obviously create words.
[00:01:56] And then, a combination of
words will create sentences,
[00:01:58] a combination of sentences
will create paragraphs.
[00:02:01] When you're beeping out each letter,
[00:02:03] dots take up one beat,
[00:02:05] and then dashes take up
three of those beats.
[00:02:08] Now, the reason that tempo matters
[00:02:09] is because obviously, when
you get two different words,
[00:02:11] you want to have some kind
of spacing between it.
[00:02:14] A space between two letters in a word
[00:02:16] would be three lengths, or three beats,
[00:02:19] and then between words
would be seven, okay?
[00:02:22] So, that way you can build words,
[00:02:24] and you know where one letter starts,
[00:02:26] one word starts, et cetera.
[00:02:28] We won't worry about that for now.
[00:02:29] Let's get to the basics of how to memorize
[00:02:32] the simplest form of the Morse code,
[00:02:34] so that you can write it
out, and then do it by ear.
[00:02:39] (thudding)
[00:02:41] All right, so our first
thing that we're gonna do
[00:02:43] is we're gonna learn
some really weird story,
[00:02:46] and it goes like this.
[00:02:48] I want you to picture
that there is an E.T.,
[00:02:50] an extra terrestrial, and
his name happens to be Ian.
[00:02:53] - [Man] Hey, Ian!
[00:02:54] - I-A-N.
[00:02:55] That's his name.
[00:02:56] It's just a regular name, Ian.
[00:02:58] And Ian, suddenly, he's very open minded,
[00:03:00] he says, "Mm, sure."
[00:03:02] And what's gonna happen
is he gets some WD-40,
[00:03:05] and before he does something with it,
[00:03:07] he says to himself out loud, "Kay, go."
[00:03:10] Like, okay, I'm ready, go.
[00:03:11] For some reason,
[00:03:12] he uses that oil to turn on
some high voltage frequency.
[00:03:16] I don't know what that means,
[00:03:17] but just imagine that
somehow with the WD-40,
[00:03:20] he has some high voltage frequency
[00:03:22] suddenly coursing through his veins.
[00:03:24] He pauses for a second, and
says to himself, "L-O-L."
[00:03:28] It was a funny experience as
an extra terrestrial, whatever.
[00:03:30] Once that's all done, he puts on his PJs,
[00:03:33] gets ready for bed, gets inside of a box,
[00:03:36] 'cause that's where
apparently E.T.s sleep,
[00:03:38] and the box happens to be size Q,
[00:03:41] 'cause Q is the size of all boxes
[00:03:43] in this extraterrestrial planet.
[00:03:45] - Duh.
[00:03:46] - That's it.
[00:03:47] So what we've actually memorized
there is just the alphabet,
[00:03:51] in a certain order,
[00:03:52] their frequency in the English
language, more or less.
[00:03:54] It's actually not quite
correct, but it's close enough.
[00:03:56] So, if we write out what we have,
[00:04:00] we have E, T, right, E.T.?
[00:04:03] His name was Ian.
[00:04:05] Right?
[00:04:06] Then, he said, "Mm, sure."
[00:04:11] M-S-U-R.
[00:04:12] Then, he gets the WD-40, W-D,
[00:04:15] and says, "Kay, go."
[00:04:17] Kay, go.
[00:04:18] Then, he turns on the
high voltage frequency.
[00:04:22] Pauses, all right, I'll put a space here.
[00:04:25] Laughs to himself,
L-O-L, that's just an L,
[00:04:28] and then another pause, we
have he puts on his PJs,
[00:04:31] gets in a box, B-X, and then it's size Q.
[00:04:35] Here's a little bit of
a stretch, but C-Y-Z.
[00:04:38] So, C-Y-Z, and then Q.
[00:04:42] The way it works is actually
there's a binary tree
[00:04:44] that can be drawn.
[00:04:45] If I have my letters here,
you start at the top,
[00:04:48] I'll put a little circle here,
[00:04:50] that's where you start,
and you branch out.
[00:04:52] At very node, you branch out.
[00:04:54] So, to the left, and to the right,
[00:04:55] I'm gonna read from left to right,
[00:04:57] the alphabet that I just wrote down here.
[00:04:59] So, the first one would be E, then T.
[00:05:03] And those happen to be
the most frequent letters
[00:05:05] in the English alphabet.
[00:05:06] Then, we branch each of those down,
[00:05:08] further into two,
[00:05:11] and my next two letters are I and A,
[00:05:14] and then we have N and M.
[00:05:16] Just going across from left to right.
[00:05:18] We continue down, breaking
those into further things.
[00:05:21] I'm running out of room here,
[00:05:22] but I'll show you the actual
chart in a little bit.
[00:05:24] So, after M was S, U, R, W, D, K, G, O,
[00:05:32] and so on, and so on.
[00:05:33] I'll let you guys finish that.
[00:05:35] I'll show the graphic in a second,
[00:05:36] so you can follow along completely.
[00:05:37] So, if you go down the branches
to the left, that's a dot,
[00:05:40] and going right down the branch is a dash.
[00:05:43] And you can literally
read out which letter is
[00:05:46] if you follow this track,
and say to yourself,
[00:05:48] okay, if I'm going left, that's a dot,
[00:05:49] if I'm going right, that's a dash,
[00:05:50] and then you just
compile them all together
[00:05:52] to create the letter.
[00:05:53] If I go to the left for
the E, that's just a dot,
[00:05:56] and that is the Morse code for E, a dot.
[00:05:59] And then, if I go to the right for T,
[00:06:01] it's a dash.
[00:06:02] Now, let's say we wanna get to S.
[00:06:04] Now, what am I gonna do?
[00:06:05] I'm gonna follow my branches here,
[00:06:06] I go down to E, that's a dot.
[00:06:08] I go down to I, that's another left move,
[00:06:10] that's another dot.
[00:06:11] And then, I go another left
branch move, that's another dot.
[00:06:14] So, S happens to be dot, dot, dot.
[00:06:17] Let's say I wanna go to O.
[00:06:18] I would go down to T, that's a dash.
[00:06:21] Okay, so I have a dash so far.
[00:06:22] I go down to M.
[00:06:23] Again that's to the right,
that's another dash,
[00:06:25] and then I go to O, that's another dash.
[00:06:26] So, O is actually dash, dash, dash.
[00:06:29] So, now if we look at this chart,
[00:06:32] there's one more layer, I
didn't draw it out here,
[00:06:33] but you can see it in the chart.
[00:06:34] You see H, V, F, from the left most,
[00:06:37] and then there's a space.
[00:06:38] Remember, I told you there was a space?
[00:06:40] The L sits there alone
as the left part of R.
[00:06:43] Then, we have P, J, B, X, C, Y, Z, Q.
[00:06:46] It just goes all the way across,
[00:06:47] and then of course,
the last two under two,
[00:06:49] there's no more letters of the alphabet.
[00:06:50] But let's say we wanna
figure out what B is, right?
[00:06:53] Which is pretty deep down the tree.
[00:06:54] So, I go to the right to get to T.
[00:06:57] That's a dash.
[00:06:58] I go to the left to
get to N, that's a dot.
[00:07:01] I see that I have to go down to D and B,
[00:07:03] which are both dots.
[00:07:04] So, B is actually dash, dot, dot, dot.
[00:07:07] Cool.
[00:07:10] So, the next step,
[00:07:11] we're gonna memorize what each
letter actually sounds like.
[00:07:14] People who are very
proficient in Morse code
[00:07:16] have suggested that you should not learn
[00:07:18] what it looks like as a pneumonic.
[00:07:20] 'Cause my first instinct was okay,
[00:07:22] maybe I'll think of,
[00:07:23] I'll look at what each letter looks like,
[00:07:25] as dots and dashes, and
I'll think of a picture,
[00:07:27] something that it looks like.
[00:07:28] But apparently, that's really tough,
[00:07:29] and once you learn it that way,
[00:07:30] it's actually hard to
translate it to audio.
[00:07:33] So, the suggestions I've read
[00:07:34] are to turn it immediately
into some sound,
[00:07:37] and then that will
always help you remember
[00:07:39] when you hear the sound,
[00:07:40] which is ultimately what
you wanna be able to do.
[00:07:43] For the way this works is for
every letter in the alphabet,
[00:07:45] we're basically gonna have a little phrase
[00:07:48] that has some kind of stress on syllables
[00:07:51] that will help you remember
a dot versus a dash.
[00:07:53] Remember, a dot is very quick,
[00:07:55] and a dash is a bit
longer, more stressed upon.
[00:07:59] So, the word that we're gonna
come up with, or the phrase,
[00:08:01] it's gonna have a similar structure
[00:08:02] as the dots and dashes of
the actual letter itself.
[00:08:05] So, let's start with our first
example here, the letter A.
[00:08:08] Now, if I just remember the word apart,
[00:08:10] the way I stress it in my head is apart.
[00:08:12] The a is short, the part is long.
[00:08:15] We have a dot and a dash.
[00:08:18] Uh, part.
[00:08:19] And some of these are totally weird.
[00:08:21] Hopefully, they're weird enough
that you can remember them.
[00:08:23] So, B is gonna be Bob is the man.
[00:08:26] Bob is the man.
[00:08:28] Bob is the man.
[00:08:29] Bob is the man.
[00:08:30] Bob is the man is dash, dot, dot, dot.
[00:08:34] Bob is the man.
[00:08:39] Now, it's important when you learn these,
[00:08:40] as I'm saying them, is to
hear them as I stress them,
[00:08:43] 'cause that's gonna
help you remember them.
[00:08:44] Bob is the man.
[00:08:46] Bob is the man.
[00:08:47] Bob is the man.
[00:08:49] Beep, dot, dot, dot.
[00:08:50] Let's roll onto C.
[00:08:51] This one's easy.
[00:08:52] I just think of Coca-Cola,
[00:08:53] but I pronounce it like this.
[00:08:55] Coca-Cola.
[00:08:56] Coca-Cola.
[00:08:58] The way Morse code is for
C is dash, dot, dash, dot.
[00:09:03] D is dog did it.
[00:09:06] Dog did it.
[00:09:07] The dog did it, right?
[00:09:09] Whatever the dog did, he did it.
[00:09:11] So, dog did it, which is dash, dot, dot.
[00:09:16] Let's move on.
[00:09:17] I'll do a few more of these,
[00:09:18] and then we'll kind go
through it a little quicker.
[00:09:20] You can spend your time learning those,
[00:09:21] and practicing vocalizing it
with those stressed syllables.
[00:09:25] So, you know what it's
supposed to sound like,
[00:09:27] what it will be like in dots and dashes.
[00:09:29] Okay, so E.
[00:09:31] This is my favorite one,
and the easiest to learn.
[00:09:33] You may not even need this.
[00:09:34] So, since we know, if you
remember from the chart,
[00:09:36] that it's at the very top of our tree.
[00:09:38] It's just a dot.
[00:09:39] The way I remember it
is I just remember eh,
[00:09:41] like someone questioning.
[00:09:42] Eh?
[00:09:43] Very quick, it's just a dot.
[00:09:44] Eh.
[00:09:48] That's easy.
[00:09:49] All right, for F, fetch a fireman.
[00:09:51] Fetch a fireman.
[00:09:53] Can you guess what that is?
[00:09:54] Dot, dot, dash, dot.
[00:09:56] Fetch a fireman.
[00:10:03] Dot, dot, dash, dot.
[00:10:05] And remember,
[00:10:05] when you come up with
these little weird stories,
[00:10:07] try to actually visualize
what you're saying.
[00:10:10] Fetching a fireman?
[00:10:12] What does that even mean?
[00:10:13] Are you fetching an
actual globule of flame,
[00:10:16] and bringing it somewhere?
[00:10:18] Are you fetching a fireman,
like an actual dude firefighter?
[00:10:22] Right?
[00:10:23] Are you carrying him over your shoulder?
[00:10:23] All right, so G,
[00:10:24] this is one of my favorite ones,
[00:10:25] just 'cause it sounds fun, is good gravy.
[00:10:29] Good gravy.
[00:10:30] Dash, dash, dot.
[00:10:31] Good gravy.
[00:10:34] Just think of your Thanksgiving,
[00:10:35] your Grandma's delicious good gravy,
[00:10:38] and as you're drinking that gravy,
[00:10:40] or you've poured it all over your turkey,
[00:10:42] you say good gravy.
[00:10:45] Just like that.
[00:10:47] All right, so the letter H,
[00:10:49] continuing on, is really easy.
[00:10:50] It's hipity hop.
[00:10:52] Everything is short, quick syllables,
[00:10:54] so that's just one, two,
three, four little dots.
[00:10:58] Hipity hop.
[00:10:59] So, for I,
[00:10:59] I can remember I bid.
[00:11:01] Like, I bid on that thing on
eBay that I wanted so much.
[00:11:04] I bid.
[00:11:05] Those are just two quick dots.
[00:11:07] I bid.
[00:11:08] Okay, J.
[00:11:09] I'm gonna think of the Jaws movie,
[00:11:11] and the phrase is in Jaws, Jaws, Jaws.
[00:11:14] So, it's a dot, dash, dash, dash.
[00:11:17] In Jaws,
[00:11:20] Jaws,
[00:11:21] Jaws!
[00:11:23] Okay, K is a good one.
[00:11:25] Kangaroo.
[00:11:27] Kangaroo.
[00:11:29] L is Los Angeles.
[00:11:31] Los Angeles.
[00:11:33] M, you can just remember is mm, mm.
[00:11:36] Dash, dash.
[00:11:37] So, something really delicious twice.
[00:11:40] N, you could remember as nudist.
[00:11:43] Dash, dot.
[00:11:45] Nudist.
[00:11:49] O you can remember as oh, my God.
[00:11:53] Three long dashes.
[00:11:57] This is a fun one.
[00:11:58] P is a poopy smell.
[00:12:01] Dot, dash, dash, dot.
[00:12:03] A poopy smell.
[00:12:05] Q is God save the queen.
[00:12:07] Dash, dash, dot, dash.
[00:12:10] God save the queen.
[00:12:17] R, you can remember something rotating.
[00:12:19] Rotation.
[00:12:20] Rotation.
[00:12:23] Rotation.
[00:12:26] S, we said before is
gonna be dot, dot, dot,
[00:12:29] and the way you can remember
[00:12:30] that is just think of some
really Spanish person saying
[00:12:33] si, si, si.
[00:12:33] For T, we have just a dash.
[00:12:35] Remember it was at the
top of our tree here.
[00:12:38] Just a single dash.
[00:12:39] You can just remember it with
a single long stress word
[00:12:42] that is starting with T, like tall.
[00:12:44] All right, for U, you
can use the word uniform,
[00:12:47] and say it like this, uniform.
[00:12:49] Uniform.
[00:12:50] So, dot, dot, dash.
[00:12:52] Uniform.
[00:12:53] For this one, it's victory V,
[00:12:55] quick three dots and a dash.
[00:12:57] Victory V.
[00:12:58] Dot, dot, dot, dash.
[00:13:00] Victory V.
[00:13:01] There ya go.
[00:13:02] W, I think of world war, so
you could say the world war.
[00:13:06] The world war.
[00:13:08] The world war.
[00:13:11] And so for X, we have X marks the spot.
[00:13:15] X marks the spot.
[00:13:20] Y, you're a cool dude.
[00:13:23] You're a cool dude.
[00:13:24] And finally, we have Z.
[00:13:26] This one's a bit weird,
but zinc zookeeper.
[00:13:29] Dash, dash, dot, dot.
[00:13:31] There ya go.
[00:13:32] (clicking)
[00:13:33] - Nice.
[00:13:34] - So, there you have it.
[00:13:35] You now have this lovely piece of paper
[00:13:38] committed to memory based on
what you heard me say weirdly.
[00:13:43] So, now, let's see if you
can actually understand
[00:13:45] what was being beeped out at
the beginning of this video.
[00:13:49] (beeping)
[00:13:52] I'll play it very slow,
at five words per minute.
[00:13:56] (beeping)
[00:13:57] M.
[00:13:58] (beeping)
[00:13:59] E.
[00:13:59] (beeping)
[00:14:00] M.
[00:14:01] (beeping)
[00:14:03] O.
[00:14:04] (beeping)
[00:14:05] R.
[00:14:06] (beeping)
[00:14:08] Y.
[00:14:09] Memory.
[00:14:10] - [Man] What happened?
[00:14:12] - I think he's talking.
[00:14:14] Just not with words.
[00:14:16] (suspenseful music)
[00:14:18] (dinging)
[00:14:23] - [Boy] Hey, what is that?
[00:14:23] - [All] Morse code.
[00:14:24] - [Man] H-E-R-E.
[00:14:26] - [All] Here.
[00:14:27] - Sweet!
[00:14:28] - That's the end of this video.
[00:14:29] I hope this was super helpful.
[00:14:30] I'm gonna give you one last message
[00:14:31] as I say my goodbyes here.
[00:14:35] (beeping)
[00:14:37] (beeping)
[00:14:40] (beeping)
[00:14:45] I am out.
[00:14:46] Subscribe, oh yeah,
[00:14:47] and like the video, all the things.
[00:14:49] Comment in the description
with a morse code message,
[00:14:52] so that nobody can see
it except you and I,
[00:14:53] and I guess everybody
else who knows Morse code.
[00:14:56] Yeah.
[00:14:57] I'm out.

=== I LOST AGAIN, AGAIN! // 2019 USA Memory Championship RECAP ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8v9nGyjjtg

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:06] so here we are again
[00:00:08] I lost again again and yeah I feel like
[00:00:15] I just made this video but here I am
[00:00:18] making begin I just want to do a little
[00:00:25] recap of what happened to me or at the
[00:00:29] us memory championship this year so
[00:00:32] close man so close I was so close so I
[00:00:35] figure I gave a quick recap and then as
[00:00:37] usual for these videos it's kind of fun
[00:00:40] to reflect back on where I was a little
[00:00:42] while ago and where I am now so let's
[00:00:45] maybe watch me react to my old video
[00:00:48] that I posted last year which was me
[00:00:49] reacting to a blog post I wrote years
[00:00:53] ago when I lost I don't need to tell you
[00:00:55] the whole format of this competition
[00:00:57] I've talked about a million times but
[00:00:59] basically in the morning we had four
[00:01:02] events names of faces which I broke a
[00:01:04] record so last year I lost my record my
[00:01:07] previous record I held was 201 names in
[00:01:10] 15 minutes this fell from one of the
[00:01:12] schools in Pennsylvania took it from me
[00:01:15] with 228 for 226 it's a whole year I've
[00:01:18] been training hard and I knew I could do
[00:01:21] it and I did 235 names in 15 minutes
[00:01:25] which is an awesome score never in my
[00:01:26] life would I have ever thought that I
[00:01:28] would be able to memorize 235 names in
[00:01:31] 15 minutes me Nelson
[00:01:33] geez so that was cool so I was in first
[00:01:35] place after that speed numbers kind of
[00:01:37] botched my first attempt got 265 digits
[00:01:39] which isn't horrible and then my second
[00:01:41] attempt I went for 340 and change and
[00:01:44] got 320 not my best but decent then we
[00:01:48] did poetry I did okay I went for about
[00:01:50] 276 points I usually make mistakes so my
[00:01:53] score I didn't beat 214 points which is
[00:01:56] okay then finally we did cards I've been
[00:01:59] playing with a new system which clearly
[00:02:01] needs some more practice my first safe
[00:02:02] round I do the minute
[00:02:04] and change I went through it like two or
[00:02:06] three times but I made one mistake so my
[00:02:08] score was like 36 cards really bad and
[00:02:10] then my second attempt I did 54 seconds
[00:02:13] felt good and I still mess stuff up so
[00:02:16] believe it or not I bombed cards I
[00:02:18] didn't get a full deck in under five
[00:02:19] minutes other people did Lance out of
[00:02:21] nowhere got think 21 seconds I don't
[00:02:24] think he's been training even so Lance
[00:02:26] is another competitor anyways I was
[00:02:28] worried that the cards would kick me out
[00:02:29] of contention to being in the afternoon
[00:02:31] rounds but no I actually was still
[00:02:34] second place after that John was first
[00:02:36] thinking Lance was third and who else we
[00:02:40] had Cameron under so afternoon events
[00:02:44] we're back to normal how they used to be
[00:02:46] here if you remember last year they had
[00:02:48] changed up the finals we're at MIT they
[00:02:50] did all sorts of different kind of
[00:02:52] versions of the event with some
[00:02:54] long-term memory none of that it was the
[00:02:55] old school thing that I knew how to win
[00:02:57] quick recap random words
[00:03:00] I memorized only 130 this time just to
[00:03:03] be safe it was very careful said them
[00:03:05] all perfectly made it through the round
[00:03:07] John forgot and was kicked out in that
[00:03:11] round which was super surprising but he
[00:03:14] keeps telling me he knows how I feel
[00:03:15] last year because I did the same thing
[00:03:16] so it was kind of a nice bonding moment
[00:03:19] tea party I'm pretty good at that no
[00:03:22] problems I didn't get a single strike
[00:03:23] then it was speed cards it was me Lance
[00:03:25] grace and Chen Shin grace attention I
[00:03:28] know that they both are not very good at
[00:03:30] cards so I didn't expect them to go too
[00:03:31] far Lance of course is very good with
[00:03:34] cards so I knew he could go through the
[00:03:36] two decks unless he messed up you have
[00:03:38] to memorize two decks in five minutes we
[00:03:42] got to the hundred and second card my
[00:03:45] turn and I said it wrong that was it so
[00:03:47] we were almost done with the two decks
[00:03:48] if we had both done it with perfectly we
[00:03:50] would have had to do a tiebreaker which
[00:03:52] never happened before the cards I got
[00:03:54] wrong I actually switched my mind but
[00:03:56] even if I had said that I actually
[00:03:58] forgot the last card and it would have
[00:04:00] been my turn to say the very last card
[00:04:02] so I would have lost regardless anyways
[00:04:04] bigger picture stuff let's let's look at
[00:04:08] where I was last year and how I feel
[00:04:11] today because that's always the
[00:04:12] interesting part as per usual let's go
[00:04:14] to Google
[00:04:17] search for google here's Google go to
[00:04:21] you two
[00:04:22] there it is lost again here we go okay
[00:04:29] after we watch stay up here okay again
[00:04:33] the second time actually this is my
[00:04:37] fourth time using this would be my fifth
[00:04:41] time losing but you know what I can say
[00:04:44] I could say I was always seven-time
[00:04:46] finalists right I was in the finals 2010
[00:04:48] 11 12 13 14 15 16 I didn't compete 79 80
[00:04:56] feet 18 1908 time finalists hey time
[00:04:59] fallenness that's not bad when I lose I
[00:05:02] lost the US memory championship a lot of
[00:05:10] people are asking the question and well
[00:05:13] it comes down to that's typically how it
[00:05:21] works let's advance to where I was
[00:05:24] talking about winning is a good thing
[00:05:27] not winning is which is a great title
[00:05:28] that's exactly what I just said but it's
[00:05:31] also obviously justification it's okay
[00:05:36] winning is great not winning is great
[00:05:39] too so what happened in 2013 before I
[00:05:41] get into this is we don't need to go
[00:05:43] into what I have into 2013 because I go
[00:05:44] into it right here but not winning is a
[00:05:48] good thing that was kind of the whole
[00:05:49] theme of this video was you know it
[00:05:51] actually propelled me in the past to
[00:05:53] come back and do something great and I
[00:05:56] think the mentality in this video was
[00:05:58] good I lost it was pretty bad let me
[00:06:00] make some changes I'll come back next
[00:06:02] year and be stronger and maybe when I
[00:06:05] did that
[00:06:06] but I did not win so I kind of broke
[00:06:08] what I expected to happen here but I did
[00:06:13] do better I did do better right I felt
[00:06:16] really strong my performance was good I
[00:06:18] came in second place and I was right
[00:06:20] there till the end I can't feel that bad
[00:06:22] about that right and as we started
[00:06:24] walking stage I was meant
[00:06:25] rehearsing both decks I knew them down
[00:06:27] cold nice
[00:06:29] so yeah the difference here is I
[00:06:31] actually did not know both decks down
[00:06:33] cold I was actually pretty rattled
[00:06:35] I don't know cuz I knew Lance was gonna
[00:06:36] push me till the end if it had just been
[00:06:38] me and the two high school students I
[00:06:40] would have felt like I had already won
[00:06:42] just cuz I knew I could do more cards
[00:06:44] but with Lance I knew it was gonna be
[00:06:46] tight
[00:06:47] and so even going onto the stage I knew
[00:06:49] all the cards in my head
[00:06:51] honestly except one and that was in the
[00:06:54] middle of the first deck I didn't tell
[00:06:56] anybody this but it luckily happened
[00:06:58] that the card that I was missing was
[00:07:01] something Lance had to say if I had have
[00:07:02] to say it I would have been out actually
[00:07:04] earlier on so he said that card and then
[00:07:06] we kept on going until the end of the
[00:07:08] deck and honestly at that point I was
[00:07:10] like oh okay I know the rest of the deck
[00:07:12] was good but then we got to the last few
[00:07:15] cards and I was like oh no I think oh
[00:07:17] I'm not sure
[00:07:18] oof so yeah panicked as we started
[00:07:20] reciting the deck on stage out loud I
[00:07:22] remember being so careful focused on
[00:07:25] saying each card correctly my dogs
[00:07:29] having like a friggin chug fest over
[00:07:32] there that's true so we were very I was
[00:07:41] very careful in saying the right card I
[00:07:43] was the last thing I wanted to do was
[00:07:45] say something wrong I was not gonna lose
[00:07:47] this on a technicality or a mistake all
[00:07:49] the while I was still trying to be as
[00:07:51] careful as possible so I didn't say the
[00:07:54] wrong thing
[00:07:55] probably the most interesting part this
[00:07:56] is how I'm justifying it all how would
[00:07:58] you like it wasn't there Jerry had it my
[00:08:01] two year dominance of God stunted by a
[00:08:03] dumb mistake mistake that might have
[00:08:06] been my last you have same memory
[00:08:08] competition that's funny 2013 I'm saying
[00:08:12] this is my last competition and 2019 I'm
[00:08:15] still competing here we go losing sucks
[00:08:17] for sure
[00:08:21] bro and it hurts especially when you
[00:08:24] know you could have won for a third
[00:08:25] straight time that's true I knew I could
[00:08:28] have won I had the two decks down and I
[00:08:31] just momentary lapse of focus and said
[00:08:35] the wrong card again this is part of the
[00:08:37] competition right I have to look at the
[00:08:38] positive and that is that losing is
[00:08:41] usually better than winning okay at
[00:08:44] least in terms of where it takes you
[00:08:45] next oh yeah that's true
[00:08:47] cuz winning yeah where will it take you
[00:08:51] you're kind of at the top and then can't
[00:08:53] really go much higher so yes I agree
[00:08:56] with this and it made total sense last
[00:08:58] year that the whole I have found myself
[00:09:01] in I was pretty upset it was gonna only
[00:09:04] propel me forward I couldn't really go
[00:09:06] much lower but I lost in a pretty
[00:09:08] miserable fashion and kind of a shocker
[00:09:10] this year I felt good
[00:09:13] I felt like I had a real chance like I
[00:09:15] was there and then as I started getting
[00:09:16] into the later afternoon events and then
[00:09:18] I was in the final finals and then I was
[00:09:20] just me and Lance and deep inside I said
[00:09:24] it's gonna happen this is gonna be my
[00:09:25] fifth championship at the same time
[00:09:27] though I knew that there was a chance I
[00:09:29] could mess up or Lance could outlast me
[00:09:31] so I was already preparing myself to
[00:09:34] potentially lose and I didn't feel too
[00:09:36] bad about it and actually when I lost
[00:09:37] you can watch the video actually here's
[00:09:39] the last few minutes where we're near
[00:09:41] the end of the deck the second deck and
[00:09:43] I'd say the mistake
[00:09:58] King the club's six of spades clubs
[00:10:08] [Music]
[00:10:19] [Music]
[00:10:25] [Applause]
[00:10:34] you can see I'm not that disappointed
[00:10:37] Lance is over the moon he's wanted to
[00:10:39] win this thing for years you know it's
[00:10:41] it's an interesting thing because now I
[00:10:42] find myself I was very happy with what I
[00:10:44] did I just I wanted to win but could I
[00:10:46] have done better yeah I mean I could
[00:10:49] have not made the mistake but getting
[00:10:50] nearly to the end of the two decks that
[00:10:52] has never happened before in competition
[00:10:54] history I did what I've done in the past
[00:10:56] and Lance was just there so where does
[00:10:59] it put me you know it's it does suck
[00:11:01] there is the feeling but like damn I
[00:11:02] would have liked to wrap up my five
[00:11:04] titles and be done with it but now you
[00:11:10] wait another year you know but this is
[00:11:12] this is it and John Graham who gave a
[00:11:14] little speech probably good point which
[00:11:16] is that these competitions are fleeting
[00:11:18] I mean you got to enjoy them while they
[00:11:20] they last and they're actually pretty
[00:11:22] hard to win just in terms of getting all
[00:11:24] the way through the end through your
[00:11:26] stress anxiety getting everything right
[00:11:28] not making a mistake that's hard and
[00:11:30] then to win it back to back to back to
[00:11:32] back is even harder and to win a fifth
[00:11:35] one you know I just come to she gets
[00:11:37] harder it's it's tough you know
[00:11:39] especially for me for someone who
[00:11:40] doesn't focus on this hundred percent
[00:11:42] anymore because he's doing it as a
[00:11:44] business so where does this put me what
[00:11:47] am i doing next you know I don't know
[00:11:50] but we'll see I don't know this is kind
[00:11:55] of weird video just an update and
[00:11:57] commentary but I feel good I don't feel
[00:11:59] bad I'm proud of what I did and excited
[00:12:04] to see where I go and happy to know that
[00:12:07] I'm still in the mix of things even
[00:12:09] though I'm no constantly training like I
[00:12:12] used to in the past
[00:12:14] anyways I just want to let you guys know
[00:12:15] what was up how it went down at the
[00:12:17] competition yeah let's get back to
[00:12:19] memory search video they
[00:12:20] yeah subscribe like this video share it
[00:12:23] and I'll see you in the next video I'm
[00:12:25] out
[00:12:26] [Music]


=== Memorizing the NATO Phonetic Alphabet (QUICKLY!) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjowl2u5C6o

[00:00:05] what's up guys I feel like I need to
[00:00:08] give you guys like a name so I can greet
[00:00:09] you guys every time I see you memo memo
[00:00:12] Pham memo memo crew what's a memo crew
[00:00:15] let's let's just try it for this video
[00:00:17] I'll think about it
[00:00:18] what's a memo crew Nelson Dellis here in
[00:00:20] another memory tips video and I figured
[00:00:23] in today's video we could watch me
[00:00:26] memorize something that I've never
[00:00:28] memorized before and currently don't
[00:00:30] know for the very first time live with
[00:00:33] you guys
[00:00:33] the thing that we're gonna memorize
[00:00:34] today are Jesus I don't even know what
[00:00:37] they're called it's like the Alpha okay
[00:00:40] so it's called the NATO phonetic
[00:00:41] alphabet and most of you already know
[00:00:44] the first three alpha bravo charlie
[00:00:46] basically what it is it's the alphabet
[00:00:47] all 26 letters with a unique
[00:00:50] unmistakable word to go with that letter
[00:00:52] these are specific words so that you can
[00:00:54] discern exactly what letter is being
[00:00:57] talked about easy example is when you
[00:00:59] call your airline to try and change your
[00:01:00] flight you give them your confirmation
[00:01:01] code and you sit there spelling out all
[00:01:04] the letters a as in Africa B as in bar
[00:01:08] you say all those things you change them
[00:01:11] up you don't even know if they are you
[00:01:12] just make them up on the fly but they
[00:01:14] when they go through theirs they have
[00:01:15] specific ones that they have learned did
[00:01:17] they go through so I figured I don't
[00:01:19] know it I want to know it some of you
[00:01:21] watching this video want to know it so
[00:01:23] here's the video on how to do that now
[00:01:27] like I said I don't know this I maybe
[00:01:29] know some of them like I said alpha
[00:01:31] Bravo Charlie maybe zebra I know some of
[00:01:33] them just from hearing it through media
[00:01:35] or listening and kind of making educated
[00:01:38] guesses I don't know I know some of them
[00:01:40] so what's gonna happen here
[00:01:42] right first thing is I'm probably just
[00:01:43] gonna pull it up on the internet read
[00:01:45] through it just 26 words right a through
[00:01:47] Z I'm gonna see which ones I already
[00:01:49] know maybe five to ten percent I already
[00:01:51] know just get a feel of the list second
[00:01:53] step is I'm actually gonna figure out a
[00:01:55] strategy to encode those things now I
[00:01:57] have an idea already because I know what
[00:01:59] the information is it's a list of things
[00:02:02] related to the alphabet so an easy way
[00:02:04] to do it would be to use a peg system
[00:02:06] which is a video I did about a year ago
[00:02:07] on how to memorize
[00:02:08] list using an alphabetic peg system
[00:02:11] which was categorized by animals watch
[00:02:13] the video don't know what I'm talking
[00:02:14] about now when I go through this I'm
[00:02:16] gonna do it at Nelson speed okay so you
[00:02:21] may not be able to follow along but you
[00:02:23] have the beauty of sitting in front of
[00:02:25] your computer right now where you can
[00:02:27] press that little pause button and pause
[00:02:29] whenever you need to take a break and
[00:02:31] absorb the thing I just said all right
[00:02:33] let's get cozy here I'm gonna pull off
[00:02:35] my list here period I'm the NATO
[00:02:37] phonetic alphabet and guess this is it I
[00:02:41] know it's been through iterations where
[00:02:43] the words have changed but I guess this
[00:02:45] is the current one here all right so
[00:02:47] let's just how to read okay a is alpha B
[00:02:51] is Bravo C is Charlie Delta echo Foxtrot
[00:02:57] Golf Hotel India Juliet kilo Lima Mike
[00:03:04] November Oscar papa Quebec Romeo Sierra
[00:03:09] tango uniform Victor whiskey x-ray
[00:03:13] Yankee and Zulu okay so it wasn't zebra
[00:03:17] let's see if I know any of them just
[00:03:20] from that one pass well this will be fun
[00:03:21] I know the alphabet so alpha Bravo
[00:03:23] Charlie Delta echo Foxtrot Golf Hotel
[00:03:27] Indigo or India Juliet
[00:03:31] Lima uh money Nemo Oscar Peru
[00:03:37] no I don't know Quebec Romeo Sierra
[00:03:40] tango whiskey I know that one from
[00:03:42] whatever T whoops Sierra tango es t you
[00:03:46] I don't know the you was belly was
[00:03:48] whiskey x-ray no Zulu I forgot what the
[00:03:52] Y was that's not bad I actually probably
[00:03:53] know most of it so it's great if I read
[00:03:56] that probably a couple more times I'd
[00:03:57] have it but if we wanted to make sure it
[00:03:59] was there these are the images that I
[00:04:01] would probably come up with okay so what
[00:04:04] i'm doing here first is devising what my
[00:04:07] alphabet hike system will be so
[00:04:09] basically for all the letters the
[00:04:10] alphabet what is as I'm doing this I'm
[00:04:13] realizing it's kind of dumb to think
[00:04:14] like okay I have a list of things that
[00:04:16] are potentially alphabet pegs themselves
[00:04:18] right a through Z and I'm trying to
[00:04:20] attach them to
[00:04:21] another image do I really have to do
[00:04:23] that it seems a bit redundant I mean
[00:04:24] again this is this is how it works right
[00:04:26] like I didn't think about this strategy
[00:04:28] until now and it made sense to me to use
[00:04:31] an alphabet peg system to memorise this
[00:04:33] one but it kind of already is its own so
[00:04:35] what might be even better then we don't
[00:04:37] have to think of any images because we
[00:04:39] already know the alphabet and we know
[00:04:40] what each letter looks like why don't we
[00:04:42] attach a picture of the thing we're
[00:04:44] trying to memorize to the shape of the
[00:04:46] letter itself that will be our anchor so
[00:04:48] forget my list here that I was designing
[00:04:50] of alphabet pegs with food words and
[00:04:53] let's just look at the actual letters
[00:04:56] themselves all right this is gonna be
[00:04:59] Nelson speed because I don't want to
[00:05:01] spend 30 minutes memorizing this stuff I
[00:05:03] just want to get it in my head I'd begun
[00:05:05] and here we go so okay I'm gonna think
[00:05:08] alpha reminds me of like alfalfa so I'm
[00:05:12] gonna picture sprouts of alfalfa coming
[00:05:15] out of the a so Bravo I think of
[00:05:16] applause so the B I can think of those
[00:05:18] two sides of the capital B like hands
[00:05:21] clapping each other Bravo okay see is
[00:05:23] Charlie I'm gonna think on the top of
[00:05:26] the curve of C is Charlie Chaplin doing
[00:05:28] his thing with his little round hat okay
[00:05:30] Delta is gonna be a D I'm gonna think of
[00:05:33] Delta Airlines I'm gonna think of an
[00:05:36] airplane flying right through the deep
[00:05:38] echo I think of the look at the capital
[00:05:40] E and I imagine the sound waves bouncing
[00:05:42] through that's an echo and then Foxtrot
[00:05:45] the two little prongs sticking out of
[00:05:47] the capital F I can imagine how the
[00:05:48] hooves like a Foxtrot a horse Fox
[00:05:51] trotting okay golf the G almost looks
[00:05:53] like a golf club that's easy
[00:05:56] hotel actually the H reminds me of hotel
[00:05:59] tonight which is an app that is the
[00:06:00] shape of an H India okay so maybe the
[00:06:03] eye itself is part of the Taj Mahal the
[00:06:05] little spiral towers that are on the
[00:06:08] sides Juliet I have a hook there for the
[00:06:11] J you can think of Romeo and Juliet
[00:06:13] maybe she's hung up on the hook of that
[00:06:15] thing and Romeo's trying to save her
[00:06:17] okay kilo Lee of decay I'm gonna imagine
[00:06:19] a kilo filling up one of those little
[00:06:21] crevices on a kilo fill it with cocaine
[00:06:23] kilo of cocaine li mo we have the L
[00:06:26] that's like Lima I'm gonna think of like
[00:06:29] a Lima Bean raw rolling down the sides
[00:06:31] of the L this would be fast forever
[00:06:33] wasn't talking okay Mike
[00:06:35] think of like a microphone so I'm just
[00:06:36] tapping both tops of the em they're like
[00:06:38] Mic Check Mic Check November we have the
[00:06:40] end makes me think of November rain so
[00:06:43] imagine this n is just dripping with
[00:06:44] water from the rain November rain okay
[00:06:47] Oscar the Oscar the Grouch he's poking
[00:06:49] his head of the garbage can which is the
[00:06:51] shape of it Oh pop but but turn that P
[00:06:53] into my dad so he's a stick figure with
[00:06:55] just a head that's the P Quebec the Q
[00:06:57] looks like a balloon would like a little
[00:06:59] thing so I'm gonna imagine being in
[00:07:01] Quebec I'm holding a balloon walking
[00:07:03] around okay Romeo hello picture like
[00:07:05] Romeo Shakespeare some guy a poet with
[00:07:08] like a weird kind of beret on so I'm
[00:07:11] gonna imagine the are pulling it on top
[00:07:12] of my head the two flaps there are the
[00:07:14] two legs of the are and then the plop on
[00:07:17] top is the Hat I don't know that's gonna
[00:07:19] stick Sierra I'm gonna imagine the
[00:07:22] Sierra range the mountain range and
[00:07:25] maybe like zig zags like it passed the
[00:07:27] the mountains tango so across the top of
[00:07:30] this tee I'm gonna imagine two people
[00:07:32] doing the tango a uniform
[00:07:34] I'm imagine stuffing some clothes like a
[00:07:36] uniform inside of that little cavity of
[00:07:38] BU then Victor V shape saying they they
[00:07:42] were victorious vvv right then whiskey
[00:07:44] I'm gonna imagine filling up the little
[00:07:46] crevices of the double the W with
[00:07:49] whiskey some strong whiskey x-ray I'm
[00:07:52] gonna imagine like taking an x-ray of
[00:07:54] that X and seeing someone's bone
[00:07:56] fractured like an X or something then
[00:07:58] yanky yanky yeah okay I'm gonna think of
[00:08:01] the wild picture kind of holding the Y
[00:08:04] upside down and using it like an
[00:08:06] old-school Yankee bayonet kind of thing
[00:08:09] and the truly Anki doodle kind of thing
[00:08:11] and then Zulu I think of like an African
[00:08:13] tribe make the woman with the really
[00:08:15] long necks with those rings stretching
[00:08:17] the neck maybe that's around the neck of
[00:08:20] the Z there okay closing my computer and
[00:08:24] let me see if I can figure it out a we
[00:08:26] had all alpha but that's alpha then B
[00:08:29] bravo charlie that's Charlie Chaplin
[00:08:33] Charlie Delta echo Foxtrot Golf Hotel
[00:08:41] India Juliet
[00:08:44] kilo cocaine al Lima on top of the M was
[00:08:52] the mic-n was the November rain
[00:08:56] Oscar I'll swear the Grouch P was a papa
[00:09:04] right it looked like my dad Papa lmnopq
[00:09:08] was Quebec our was Romeo the funny hat s
[00:09:12] was Sierra
[00:09:13] T was tango s tu uniform putting the
[00:09:19] uniform in there v was Victor victorious
[00:09:23] TUV W was whiskey X was X ray why was
[00:09:30] Yankee Doodle Yankee and then Z was Ulu
[00:09:33] knife it's all there
[00:09:34] all right so let me see if I can say it
[00:09:36] really fast we're as fast as possible
[00:09:38] camped alpha Bravo Charlie Delta echo
[00:09:40] Foxtrot Golf Hotel India Juliet kilo
[00:09:46] Lima Mike November Oscar papa
[00:09:53] Romeo uh Papa LMNOP cheese papa Quebec
[00:09:58] Romeo Sierra tango uniform Victor
[00:10:04] whiskey x-ray Yankee and Zulu that's
[00:10:08] cool now if you know the alphabet
[00:10:09] backwards cy x w vu t sr q p o n ml k JH
[00:10:14] g f e d c ba then you can do all those
[00:10:17] backwards to write so you just have to
[00:10:19] go through the alphabet and say the word
[00:10:20] that you see there are you impressed
[00:10:22] yeah well anyways I hope that helped
[00:10:24] maybe give you a little bit of insight
[00:10:26] into how my weird-ass brain works when I
[00:10:29] memorize stuff and hopefully it helps
[00:10:31] you with some ideas on how to memorize
[00:10:32] this really quick you probably know a
[00:10:34] lot of them already and probably with
[00:10:36] three four or five passes of just
[00:10:38] reading this and probably it would have
[00:10:39] most of them except for a few and then
[00:10:41] you could review the ones that you keep
[00:10:42] missing but now I have it built into my
[00:10:44] head so whenever I see the letter I'm
[00:10:46] just gonna instinctively think of the
[00:10:48] weird image that I plopped on top of the
[00:10:50] shape of the actual cow
[00:10:52] so do me a favor anybody who watch this
[00:10:54] anybody who tried this time yourself
[00:10:56] tell me how long in the comments it took
[00:10:59] you to memorize this list love to hear
[00:11:01] about it that's all for this video
[00:11:02] memory no that's all for this video memo
[00:11:05] crew yeah maybe it's growing on me a
[00:11:07] little bit that's all for this video
[00:11:08] I'll see you in the next one please like
[00:11:10] subscribe share you know the drill I'm
[00:11:13] out

=== MEMORIZING LONG TERM // 5 TIPS ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0DiQ_NXjQA

[00:00:00] what's up everybody Nelson dallis here
[00:00:02] four-time USA memory champion and in
[00:00:05] today's video I'm going to talk about
[00:00:06] how to keep information lots of
[00:00:08] information fresh in your mind for the
[00:00:10] long term you guys ready let's get at it
[00:00:13] oh and I'll be giving away one free
[00:00:15] premium membership to drops the drops
[00:00:17] app that I've been using to one of my
[00:00:19] viewers here watch till the end of this
[00:00:20] video and I'll explain to you how you
[00:00:22] can have a chance at winning that all
[00:00:24] right so as many of you know I've been
[00:00:25] working on learning Dutch for the past
[00:00:28] almost 3 months I had set out the
[00:00:30] beginning of the year to do this 90-day
[00:00:31] challenge of memorizing 2,000 words in
[00:00:34] Dutch using this drops app and it's been
[00:00:38] great it's been a bit overwhelming but
[00:00:40] it's been an awesome Challenge and I'm
[00:00:41] coming up at the 90-day Mark so I hit
[00:00:44] 2,000 words just a few weeks ago and now
[00:00:47] all I'm doing in these last few days is
[00:00:50] review even though I have those words
[00:00:52] I've learned those words I need them to
[00:00:53] be accessible on the spot now many of
[00:00:56] you may not be learning a language some
[00:00:58] of you may be doing the challenge as
[00:00:59] well but I'm sure there's something that
[00:01:01] you've studied for in the past or you
[00:01:03] plan on studying for where there's a lot
[00:01:05] of information and while memory
[00:01:06] techniques are awesome because they get
[00:01:08] stuff into your brain really quickly
[00:01:10] sometimes it feels like so much
[00:01:12] information regardless of what memory
[00:01:14] techniques you use is tough to really
[00:01:16] Master when it gets past a certain size
[00:01:19] so I figured I'd devote this video to
[00:01:21] explaining some tips that I can give you
[00:01:24] that will help you get that information
[00:01:25] that's in your head into your long term
[00:01:28] so that you actually know all 2,000
[00:01:30] words or all of the things that you've
[00:01:32] previously
[00:01:39] memorized all right so starting with the
[00:01:41] obvious this is almost like Step Zero is
[00:01:43] basically don't underestimate reviewing
[00:01:46] so I've been learning all these words as
[00:01:48] you may have been learning all sorts of
[00:01:50] information for a test or whatnot and of
[00:01:52] course you know you need to study you
[00:01:53] need to go over what you just learned
[00:01:54] but review is honestly where the magic
[00:01:57] happens when it comes to long-term
[00:01:59] memory unfortunately I wish memory
[00:02:01] techniques were the end all be all but
[00:02:04] if you want stuff to stay in your mind
[00:02:06] forever you can't escape review I just
[00:02:08] wanted to preface my upcoming tips that
[00:02:10] it starts with review you got to do what
[00:02:12] you got to
[00:02:14] do so my first tip is to learn new
[00:02:18] things or review what you've already
[00:02:20] learned in new and different locations
[00:02:22] each time you study what I mean by this
[00:02:24] is typically you might have your office
[00:02:27] or your desk where you go to study but
[00:02:29] what happens is it becomes the same
[00:02:31] thing and what you can do by actually
[00:02:32] going somewhere else to study or to
[00:02:34] learn new information is you suddenly
[00:02:36] give that study session a little more
[00:02:38] oomph a little more uh separation from
[00:02:41] the tedious Norm that you may encounter
[00:02:44] by going to your study desk every day
[00:02:46] and what that will do is the stuff that
[00:02:47] you actually study in that moment in
[00:02:49] that new location will actually become
[00:02:51] more memorable because of the situation
[00:02:53] you put yourself in so I'm always on
[00:02:55] this drops app trying to memorize I
[00:02:57] usually do it while I'm in bed or kind
[00:02:59] of just hanging around on the couch or
[00:03:00] at the desk there what I'll do is I'll
[00:03:02] make this effort to go to a coffee shop
[00:03:05] or I'll go on the balcony or I'll go
[00:03:06] downstairs or take a walk and I'll learn
[00:03:09] more words or I'll study some of my
[00:03:11] words while doing that and then what
[00:03:13] happens is later when I'm thinking about
[00:03:15] some of the things that I had reviewed
[00:03:17] that session it's got this sudden extra
[00:03:20] context and it's suddenly more memorable
[00:03:22] because I was like oh this is what I
[00:03:23] studied when I was doing X and while I
[00:03:26] was at Y and it makes it a lot more
[00:03:28] memorable
[00:03:30] [Music]
[00:03:31] all right so my next tip is to have
[00:03:34] someone quiz you sounds pretty obvious
[00:03:36] and well while there are some apps that
[00:03:38] will help you review actual flash cards
[00:03:41] flash card apps in my case the drops app
[00:03:44] is a gamified version of review
[00:03:47] sometimes it helps to step away from
[00:03:48] that information hand it to someone else
[00:03:50] and have them drill you because they're
[00:03:53] not going to know much about the
[00:03:54] information and they're not going to
[00:03:55] know also how to quiz you in the way
[00:03:57] that you've been quizzed a million times
[00:03:59] before so that actually will make you
[00:04:01] kind of be on your toes and have to kind
[00:04:04] of access the information possibly
[00:04:05] differently and again more memorably and
[00:04:08] also what happens is if you're studying
[00:04:10] with someone else and they're quizzing
[00:04:12] you what might happen just kind of out
[00:04:14] of the circumstance is that they may
[00:04:16] quiz you on something and you may not
[00:04:17] know or you fumble about and then
[00:04:19] there's some kind of maybe follow-up
[00:04:21] conversation about that word or
[00:04:23] definition that you're you're supposed
[00:04:25] to have known that extra conversation
[00:04:27] about it will again enhance the memory
[00:04:29] of the thing you kind of flubbed
[00:04:31] on all right so my next tip here is kind
[00:04:34] of obvious but I do have to say it as a
[00:04:37] tip on its own and that is to talk about
[00:04:39] it you know when you get studying and
[00:04:41] you're just always kind of quietly by
[00:04:42] yourself looking at papers playing on an
[00:04:44] app you can be great in the app great on
[00:04:46] the paper great with your flash cards
[00:04:47] but when it comes to actually
[00:04:49] externalizing the information maybe
[00:04:51] you're not so good so talking about it
[00:04:53] to someone else kind of explaining maybe
[00:04:56] something you leared or something that
[00:04:58] you are trying to understand is a great
[00:05:00] way to kind of enhance the memory of
[00:05:03] that thing this is called the fan
[00:05:05] technique and it's based on this famous
[00:05:07] physicist Richard feeman uh awesome guy
[00:05:10] you should read about him one of my
[00:05:11] favorites what the technique essentially
[00:05:12] says is that when you're learning
[00:05:14] something trying to explain that to
[00:05:16] someone else is one of the best ways to
[00:05:19] see if you actually know what you
[00:05:21] learned if you can explain it perfectly
[00:05:23] in your own words obviously not from rot
[00:05:25] memory word for word but in your own
[00:05:27] words then chances are that it's
[00:05:29] probably strong in your memory and it's
[00:05:32] good to go but what happens as you talk
[00:05:33] about it or explain it to someone you
[00:05:35] might notice that there are certain
[00:05:36] parts of it that you really understand
[00:05:38] and certain parts of it that you don't
[00:05:40] quite fully understand and that'll help
[00:05:41] you figure out which parts of what you
[00:05:43] study need more attention so talk about
[00:05:47] it all right so the next tip is to split
[00:05:50] up your sessions what I mean by that is
[00:05:52] sometimes when you go into study mode
[00:05:54] you kind of say okay these are my a
[00:05:56] lotted hours I'm going to sit down and
[00:05:57] study the heck out of my stuff my
[00:05:59] information while that's great and very
[00:06:01] productive sometimes that can do harm to
[00:06:03] your actual mental state in terms of
[00:06:05] focus and in terms of effective
[00:06:07] reviewing what Studies have shown is
[00:06:09] actually by splitting up your study
[00:06:10] sessions into smaller bits you can
[00:06:12] actually accomplish more so actually
[00:06:14] every time you kind of take a break your
[00:06:16] brain goes into this consolidation mode
[00:06:18] and it kind of organizes the information
[00:06:20] from the previous study session and then
[00:06:21] when you come back it's kind of got a
[00:06:23] leg up on what you're about to study so
[00:06:26] what I like to do is I'll maybe study
[00:06:28] for increments of 20 5 to 30 minutes
[00:06:30] then take a very short break and then
[00:06:32] come back maybe study something
[00:06:33] different for 20 30 minutes then maybe
[00:06:36] study something different for 25 30 more
[00:06:38] minutes take a break and then I might
[00:06:40] return back to what I had studied the
[00:06:41] previous session so it's not always the
[00:06:43] same thing back to back to back I like
[00:06:45] to split it up it does two things one is
[00:06:47] it keeps things fresh right studying the
[00:06:50] same thing for many hours can get really
[00:06:52] tiring and then by the end you're doing
[00:06:54] more harm than you're doing good by
[00:06:56] splitting it up you make things fresh
[00:06:57] every time and then by the time you come
[00:06:59] back to the thing you were studying
[00:07:00] before it's a little more interesting
[00:07:03] and you have more Focus to pay attention
[00:07:05] to it also by splitting it up again like
[00:07:07] I said it helps your brain consolidate
[00:07:09] the information and so it'll stick more
[00:07:11] in the long
[00:07:12] [Music]
[00:07:14] run I love this tip because I do it a
[00:07:16] lot and it actually does wonders for me
[00:07:19] and that is to draw images for the stuff
[00:07:22] that you're trying to recall flash cards
[00:07:24] can be great and if you want to do those
[00:07:25] that's fine I'm not saying draw your
[00:07:26] flash cards all I'm saying is during
[00:07:29] your study session have a a notebook or
[00:07:32] a piece of paper and the things that are
[00:07:34] kind of iffy that you're not so sure
[00:07:36] about or kind of weak in terms of your
[00:07:38] recall draw them out like an actual
[00:07:40] image of them I don't mean write down
[00:07:42] the word or the definition I mean draw a
[00:07:45] picture and if you want to even take it
[00:07:46] further use colors color it in or add
[00:07:49] some shading that act of drawing
[00:07:51] something out external to what is in
[00:07:53] your memory will make that more
[00:07:55] memorable there's a recent study that
[00:07:57] said that if you draw things you'll
[00:07:58] remember it better and while that's not
[00:08:00] always the case in this situation I
[00:08:03] think that drawing out the things that
[00:08:04] you're weak on will actually help you
[00:08:06] remember them I hope this video was
[00:08:08] helpful I know a lot of you guys who
[00:08:10] watch my channel are studying something
[00:08:12] or trying to improve your memory so this
[00:08:14] should help with things that you're

=== MEMORY EXPERT reacts to MONTY PYTHON MEMORY SKETCH ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUpQre368yE

[00:00:00] what does it make you think of well uh
[00:00:04] what would you like to think of like to
[00:00:07] think of a new
[00:00:13] woman what's up everyone Nelson dallis
[00:00:15] here there's some interesting content
[00:00:17] out there that I think would be cool to
[00:00:18] have my say on it so I figured I'd do a
[00:00:22] reaction video to watching a memory skit
[00:00:25] that is kind of in popular culture out
[00:00:27] on the web one of my favorites and it's
[00:00:30] it's also fun to watch I have the link
[00:00:31] in the description below where you can
[00:00:33] watch it as I watch it now it's funny to
[00:00:35] see what people think memory techniques
[00:00:37] are like whether they're true or far
[00:00:40] from the truth um it's funny regardless
[00:00:42] so this is one from John C Monty Python
[00:00:46] so John C did a talk here at some event
[00:00:48] in La uh with Eric Idol and it's
[00:00:51] hilarious they actually read out a bit
[00:00:53] from his book which is a dropped sketch
[00:00:55] from Monty Python that they never did
[00:00:57] but it's all about memory training it's
[00:00:58] hilarious so without further Ado let's
[00:01:00] watch this and see what they think of
[00:01:02] memory
[00:01:04] techniques which one are we doing that
[00:01:07] that one okay all right all right okay
[00:01:11] you come into my office cuz you want to
[00:01:13] take a course in how to improve your
[00:01:15] memory okay okay so this one guy's
[00:01:18] walking into John C's or this guy's
[00:01:21] office wanting memory techniques right
[00:01:24] okay come in oh good morning come in
[00:01:28] come in thank you do sit down now what
[00:01:30] can I do for you uh well I'm interested
[00:01:32] in your memory training program oh good
[00:01:35] well a lot of people feel that they'd
[00:01:37] like to improve their Memories the
[00:01:38] wonderful thing is improving them is not
[00:01:41] as hard as
[00:01:44] um not as hard as
[00:01:47] uh as hard as nails so I get this joke
[00:01:52] all the time you know within meeting
[00:01:54] someone um you know I give them their
[00:01:56] name or they ask for mine and then two
[00:01:59] seconds later if it's the funniest thing
[00:02:00] in the world to be like uh what was your
[00:02:02] name again know but that supposed to be
[00:02:06] funny and then they always follow up
[00:02:08] with I bet you never get that one in a
[00:02:10] sarcastic way because they know and we
[00:02:13] both know that I get that joke all the
[00:02:16] time it's not funny it's cute it's kind
[00:02:19] of funny but it's actually really not
[00:02:21] funny at all cuz
[00:02:24] I cuz I literally get that joke all the
[00:02:28] time so that's true and that's funny
[00:02:30] when they do it it's funny I beg you p
[00:02:33] as hard as
[00:02:35] Nails it's word association you see it's
[00:02:38] the basis of my system you remember
[00:02:40] things by associating with
[00:02:45] um associating with people like that so
[00:02:49] yeah I mean this is the foundation for
[00:02:51] everything I te Teach on this channel is
[00:02:53] Association right um but I love how
[00:02:55] they're playing on the fact that he's a
[00:02:58] memory instructor and he's of course of
[00:02:59] course forgetting uh what he's talking
[00:03:07] about people like
[00:03:09] what people like to improve their
[00:03:11] memories you see now what can I do for
[00:03:17] you this guys a genius well I'm I'm
[00:03:20] interested in your course good good you
[00:03:23] remembered that you
[00:03:26] see you see you've learned to associate
[00:03:29] your interest in my course with my
[00:03:31] asking
[00:03:33] why it's associational ideas you see
[00:03:36] it's the basis of everything we do to
[00:03:37] acquire a better memory but it's not as
[00:03:39] hard as um I think no hard as Nails oh
[00:03:44] remember so he's obviously driving home
[00:03:46] the point of this Association sometimes
[00:03:48] it gets out of hand and people are like
[00:03:50] why are you doing all this Association
[00:03:52] where you can just remember their actual
[00:03:53] thing um and here he doesn't even
[00:03:56] remember what the point of the of having
[00:03:59] memory techniques or Association is in
[00:04:01] the first place and he can't even
[00:04:02] remember that so I think that's pretty
[00:04:04] funny and kind of on point remember
[00:04:06] never mind never mind you'll soon pick
[00:04:08] it up now take a common object like this
[00:04:12] a sorcer good well done now what does it
[00:04:16] make you think of well um what would you
[00:04:20] like to think of like to think of a nude
[00:04:27] woman first of all saucers a teacup
[00:04:30] right we're in England here um or these
[00:04:32] guys are British right um and you know
[00:04:35] that's honestly when I teaching someone
[00:04:37] techniques I'm like what does it make
[00:04:39] you think of what is the first thing you
[00:04:41] think of so that part is on Q and then
[00:04:43] he goes straight to what would you like
[00:04:45] to think of a nude woman I mean yeah I
[00:04:48] mean a large I wouldn't say 100% or I
[00:04:51] wouldn't say 90% but a big percentage of
[00:04:56] memory athletes thoughts are of um
[00:05:01] um perverted things perhaps tasteful
[00:05:04] perverted things nude woman well done
[00:05:07] well done you're getting it now what is
[00:05:10] the nude woman
[00:05:12] doing drinking tea good and what's she
[00:05:16] drinking tea out of a a cup quite right
[00:05:20] a cup and
[00:05:26] salsa typical reaction maybe when I
[00:05:29] start teaching someone memory techniques
[00:05:31] is yeah I get the association
[00:05:35] but why I could have just thought of the
[00:05:37] saucer right think of the nude woman
[00:05:41] having tea in the cup that's on the
[00:05:44] saucer are you getting it I'm not sure
[00:05:47] well one of the association ideas uh
[00:05:50] that is the basis of our method indeed
[00:05:52] the whole the whole um the hole in the
[00:05:57] wall and what do I see through the hole
[00:06:00] in the wall and you
[00:06:03] woman every
[00:06:05] time every time every time because it's
[00:06:08] such a strong image you can't forget it
[00:06:11] it's true you can't forget these nudity
[00:06:15] based lewd images hole in the wall what
[00:06:18] do you see Unforgettable duh a nude
[00:06:21] woman or person you associate that with
[00:06:25] anything you want to remember anything
[00:06:26] numbers dates names anything try again
[00:06:29] always to battle of tra ah trala trala
[00:06:33] square square hole in the wall look
[00:06:37] through the whole in the
[00:06:39] wall what do I see a nude woman
[00:06:47] excellent excellent now who is this nude
[00:06:50] woman oh I don't know the empress
[00:06:54] Josephine
[00:06:57] 1815 Josephine R Rhymes you see so this
[00:07:01] is pretty common number rhyming scheme
[00:07:04] so 1815
[00:07:06] Josephine she's who you see in the hole
[00:07:08] in the wall I'm guessing naked so
[00:07:11] obviously why would you forget that and
[00:07:14] troger square square relates to Circle
[00:07:18] that sounds so dumb as I'm saying but
[00:07:19] it's
[00:07:20] awesome uh 1815 was water L to fgo was
[00:07:24] 1805 yes wait a minute I haven't
[00:07:26] finished
[00:07:28] um Joe Josephine's wearing boots
[00:07:31] Wellington Boots you can't see the toes
[00:07:34] so deduct the 10 that you can't
[00:07:36] see from
[00:07:38] 1815 185 simple so I mean this is common
[00:07:44] where I have a vision of something I
[00:07:46] teach my student where it seems like an
[00:07:47] obvious demonic link or Association to
[00:07:50] me and it's not quite right a fit for
[00:07:52] them so you can always alter it to make
[00:07:54] it fit for you in this case it's
[00:07:57] hilarious that you just imagines oh
[00:07:59] while she was wearing boots you couldn't
[00:08:01] see her toes deduct the 10 and now you
[00:08:03] have 1805 instead of 1815 Josephine hold
[00:08:07] on a Walter AER
[00:08:15] Square all right the date of Waterloo
[00:08:18] 1815 yes but how do you do it oh wait a
[00:08:21] minute let me think wter L Water watero
[00:08:25] Station train to Brighton Brighton here
[00:08:30] peer through the hole of the wall and
[00:08:32] what do we
[00:08:36] see there's the empress Josephine in the
[00:08:39] new
[00:08:42] 1815 but she's got Wellington Boots on
[00:08:44] no no battle waterl Duke of Wellington
[00:08:47] and he comes wants his boots back so he
[00:08:50] sees her toes no need to deduct 10
[00:08:53] waterl 1815
[00:08:56] see just I mean this gets ridiculous
[00:09:00] right this isn't actually how memory
[00:09:02] techniques work but it's a fun uh kind
[00:09:06] of exaggeration of some of the
[00:09:08] association that goes on when we try to
[00:09:11] make someone memorize
[00:09:13] something far of London what the date of
[00:09:16] the Fire of London oh let me think let
[00:09:18] me think date of the Fire of London Fire
[00:09:20] fiery fiery diary Diary Samuel peeps yes
[00:09:26] Samuel peeps wrote in a diary about the
[00:09:27] Fire of London Samuel peeps
[00:09:31] peeps through the hole in the wall
[00:09:34] and what does he saying a nude
[00:09:39] woman no three nude women By the Light
[00:09:43] of the fire he sees three stunning
[00:09:45] gorgeous nude women sex sex sex
[00:09:54] 1666 that's amazing I mean memory
[00:09:57] techniques it's all about nude women in
[00:09:59] the wall sex sex
[00:10:02] sex it's not it's not really it's a bit
[00:10:04] more than that but they do drive home a
[00:10:06] point that is really true and that is
[00:10:08] you often want to try to tap into the
[00:10:11] kind of uh emotional urges that humans
[00:10:14] have because those are the things we
[00:10:16] remember doesn't always have to be sex
[00:10:18] but that is one that
[00:10:20] uh typically works pretty well classic
[00:10:22] stuff anyways I hope you enjoyed that if
[00:10:24] you want to watch the full video of that
[00:10:26] without me interrupting it the link is

[00:10:31] so if you want to read that uh it's just
[00:10:34] absolutely hilarious I listen to it at
[00:10:36] least a couple times a year and I get
[00:10:37] the same laugh out of it I hope you
[00:10:39] enjoyed this video it's kind of a bonus
[00:10:41] video um I might be doing more of these
[00:10:43] in the future cuz there's a bunch of
[00:10:44] funny depictions of memory and what
[00:10:47] memory techniques are like in pop
[00:10:49] culture in different shows different
[00:10:51] recordings that I've heard or whatever
[00:10:52] so I might do some videos like these and

=== STOP FAILING AT YOUR GOALS // One Simple Tip ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZecuyEkvM9U

[00:00:05] when it comes to sticking to your New
[00:00:07] Year's resolutions the odds are against
[00:00:09] you statistically speaking 80% of people
[00:00:11] fail at upholding their resolutions or
[00:00:13] progress towards their goals by the
[00:00:15] middle of February
[00:00:17] bottom-line it's pretty likely that
[00:00:19] you've either dropped your goal or
[00:00:21] resolution by now or you've lost some of
[00:00:23] the intensity that you first had when
[00:00:25] you start I'm no different I had goals
[00:00:29] that I said at the beginning of the year
[00:00:30] some I stuck with others I've let lose
[00:00:33] steam and some I haven't even started on
[00:00:35] probably shouldn't had so many goals
[00:00:37] right but no matter this is the nature
[00:00:39] of things life gets in the way and
[00:00:41] things that you thought were a priority
[00:00:43] shift and are no longer a priority and
[00:00:46] vice versa this is Daniel he's an actor
[00:00:52] slash youtuber and recently a friend of
[00:00:54] mine he's pretty hilarious and a great
[00:00:56] pianist pianist kids they're actually
[00:00:59] dead my golf games been improving that
[00:01:01] should definitely check out his channel
[00:01:02] by the way anyways he gave me this
[00:01:04] simple piece of advice that I wanted to
[00:01:06] share with you on how to keep yourself
[00:01:08] accountable to some of those goals you
[00:01:10] set at the beginning of the year here it
[00:01:12] is
[00:01:12] grab your phone seriously pause this
[00:01:16] video right now and grab your phone then
[00:01:18] set a reminder on your phone to go off
[00:01:20] every Sunday night at 7 p.m. or pick a
[00:01:23] time when you know you're not at work or
[00:01:25] it's convenient whatever and have it say
[00:01:27] this where are you right now with your
[00:01:31] goals that's it
[00:01:33] just that little check-in will gear you
[00:01:34] up for the upcoming week I've been doing
[00:01:36] this since Daniel suggested it to me and
[00:01:38] it always catches me right when I need
[00:01:40] to reevaluate my efforts and strategies
[00:01:42] towards my goals it's important that
[00:01:45] when the reminder pops up though be
[00:01:47] honest with yourself and make sure to
[00:01:49] answer the question out loud I've
[00:01:52] reached a goal your gut reaction should
[00:01:54] be enough to tell you where to put your
[00:01:56] efforts
[00:01:56] James clear the author of atomic habits
[00:01:59] calls this part pointing and calling
[00:02:01] just by reiterating a statement about
[00:02:03] your goals and your intention towards
[00:02:05] them will make you more aware of
[00:02:07] and more likely to act on them as James
[00:02:11] says many of our failures in performance
[00:02:13] are largely attributable to a lack of
[00:02:16] self-awareness please try it it's been
[00:02:19] incredibly effective for me and I think
[00:02:20] it will be for you too see you next

[00:02:12] they've taken off two weeks of their
[00:02:13] life as I have um from my kids my wife
[00:02:17] my dog to see this amazing view of
[00:02:20] Everest and this experience of trekking
[00:02:23] through this Valley it's funny when I
[00:02:25] put together these trips everybody's
[00:02:27] interested why wouldn't you be right
[00:02:29] this is Everest base camp I want to see
[00:02:31] Everest right why wouldn't you want to
[00:02:32] see Everest and so I sign up everybody I
[00:02:35] make a list of who's interested the
[00:02:37] thing is when it comes down to actually
[00:02:39] committing to the trip and paying for it
[00:02:41] and booking the lodgings and flights and
[00:02:43] all
[00:02:45] that I'd say 1% come through it's the
[00:02:49] craziest thing and it's always the same
[00:02:52] excuses ah now's not a good time I
[00:02:54] didn't save enough money you know maybe
[00:02:56] I'll do it next year always the same
[00:02:59] excuses
[00:03:00] and I understand life can get in the way
[00:03:03] but the thing you got to understand if
[00:03:04] you want to make your life memorable it
[00:03:06] starts with doing things now imagining
[00:03:10] that you cannot do it in the future and
[00:03:12] you have to do it now now sure maybe you
[00:03:14] actually can't afford it but there's
[00:03:16] always going to be things that you can't
[00:03:17] afford so why not do it one of the first
[00:03:21] trips I did was climb Denali and I could
[00:03:24] not afford it um but something inside me
[00:03:27] said I had to do it now I couldn't do it
[00:03:29] later I had to do it now and so this is
[00:03:32] not the best way to do this and I don't
[00:03:33] advise you to do this um but I put it on
[00:03:36] a credit card I put that $5,000 trip on
[00:03:39] a credit card yeah it was expensive I
[00:03:40] could not afford it um but you know what
[00:03:43] I needed that change and it changed my
[00:03:45] life it changed my fraking life and when
[00:03:49] I came back I worked my ass off to pay
[00:03:51] it back I paid it off within a few
[00:03:53] months and it was the best thing I ever
[00:03:56] did now here's another thing to think
[00:03:58] about I heard this once and I I think
[00:04:00] it's super true all the things that
[00:04:02] you've dreamt about all your dream
[00:04:05] travels goals that you've been talking
[00:04:08] about for years and haven't
[00:04:10] done if you haven't done them yet
[00:04:13] chances are you actually probably don't
[00:04:15] want it that bad at
[00:04:16] all right otherwise you would have
[00:04:20] fcking done it
[00:04:23] [Music]
[00:04:58] all right so let's talk about three tips
[00:05:01] that can make your life more
[00:05:02] memorable the first tip and it's
[00:05:05] probably the most important one is to do
[00:05:08] more uh there have been studies that
[00:05:10] show that people who do the same thing
[00:05:12] or the same kind of routine over a
[00:05:14] period of time can't really distinguish
[00:05:17] one day from the other and time seem
[00:05:19] speed up um why because every day Blends
[00:05:22] into the next so by logical induction
[00:05:25] you can imagine if I do more say in the
[00:05:29] span of a week week I do something new
[00:05:30] every day and make it varied uh when you
[00:05:33] think back on it at the end of the week
[00:05:35] it's going to feel like a lot of time
[00:05:36] passed by so next time you go through a
[00:05:39] whole year and you say wow that year
[00:05:40] passed by really quickly chances are you
[00:05:43] probably didn't do a lot of new exciting
[00:05:46] invigorating things so first step to
[00:05:49] making your life memorable is to take on
[00:05:51] more challenges more exciting Adventures
[00:05:54] to do more unique things every day go to
[00:05:58] that new restaurant make make an effort
[00:06:00] to go out with new friends new
[00:06:01] experiences learn new things read new
[00:06:03] books uh that's the best I can tell you
[00:06:06] tip number two is to keep track of your
[00:06:09] memories keep track of your events
[00:06:11] somehow by taking pictures or writing it
[00:06:14] down taking a journal have some kind of
[00:06:16] external form of the actual experience
[00:06:19] that you had now I know there's a fine
[00:06:21] line between being in an experience and
[00:06:23] taking photos all the time you remove
[00:06:25] yourself from the experience not asking
[00:06:28] you to do that I'm asking you to
[00:06:29] experience what you're experience this
[00:06:31] new thing that you've agreed to do in
[00:06:34] life and then afterwards or when you can
[00:06:37] take a quick snapshot some other means
[00:06:39] of remembering this moment that way
[00:06:41] you'll have an external form of that
[00:06:43] memory and it'll solidify even more by
[00:06:46] the way that's Everest over there
[00:06:48] [Music]
[00:07:05] [Music]
[00:07:11] welcome to Everest Base Camp Everest is
[00:07:14] right behind there and so that last
[00:07:17] third tip is to
[00:07:20] review think about your memories try to
[00:07:22] go over them in detail write them out
[00:07:25] tell someone about that story you'll
[00:07:27] find that even sometimes old old
[00:07:29] memories that you thought were memorable
[00:07:31] and you think you may have forgotten if
[00:07:32] you just kind of think about them for a
[00:07:34] little moment a lot more detail will
[00:07:36] come back and that active process of
[00:07:39] remembering it that review will make it
[00:07:41] more memorable down the road it'll make
[00:07:43] its way into your long-term memory
[00:07:46] that's all I got for you guys this time
[00:07:48] it's amazing out here thanks for
[00:07:51] watching please like subscribe all the

=== 6 WAYS TO MEMORIZE FOREIGN VOCAB ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6j2mU8OCsA

[00:00:00] - What's up everyone?
[00:00:01] Nelson Dellis here and another episode
[00:00:02] of Random Memory Tips.
[00:00:04] And I just wanted to give
you guys a little update
[00:00:07] on how my Drops 2K Challenge
Learning Dutch, is going.
[00:00:12] And it's going well.
[00:00:13] I've learned about 1,000 words.
[00:00:15] We're about 30 days in.
[00:00:17] I've been working on the app every day.
[00:00:19] I maybe learn about three
or four modules a day,
[00:00:22] which is about 17 words per modules.
[00:00:24] So 17 times four, 68.
[00:00:30] Obviously that doesn't add
up to 1,000 over 30 days
[00:00:33] but some of the days I actually spend
[00:00:35] just reviewing past ones
that I've learned already.
[00:00:38] If some of you have read the
book by Seth Godin, The Dip,
[00:00:42] you know that when you start something new
[00:00:43] there's always kind of a quick rise
[00:00:45] in achievement and excitement.
[00:00:47] And that was me when I started.
[00:00:49] I was learning words real quick.
[00:00:51] It was fun.
[00:00:52] The whole process was novel.
[00:00:53] And words were sticking.
[00:00:55] It was very easy to keep
track of 200, 300 words.
[00:00:58] But obviously as I started learning more
[00:01:00] you kind of get this dip.
[00:01:02] And this is where most people will quit
[00:01:04] with any given task,
[00:01:05] whether it's learning some new skill
[00:01:06] or trying to stick with
a habit for 30 days plus.
[00:01:10] And so now I'm in that dip.
[00:01:12] I'm learning more and more words.
[00:01:14] It's kind of building on each other.
[00:01:15] It's getting to be pretty heavy
[00:01:16] in terms of information
that I need to hold
[00:01:18] and I gotta push through
[00:01:20] to come out on the other end of that dip.
[00:01:21] So I figure today we'll
talk about some examples
[00:01:25] of words that I've encountered
[00:01:26] and how I went about memorizing them.
[00:01:28] I've done a video before
[00:01:29] about how to memorize foreign words.
[00:01:31] It's pretty simple.
[00:01:32] Just come up with a picture for the thing,
[00:01:34] the foreign word,
[00:01:35] and come up with a
picture for the meaning,
[00:01:37] smash 'em together.
[00:01:38] That's what I've been doing.
[00:01:39] But the beautiful thing about Dutch is
[00:01:40] that some of these words
are actually pretty weird
[00:01:43] in themselves, which makes them memorable.
[00:01:45] Some of them are really fun to say
[00:01:47] and just roll off the tongue
[00:01:48] which also makes them memorable.
[00:01:50] Some, literally, translate to
some really funny combinations
[00:01:53] that just make it inherently memorable.
[00:01:56] So there's actually a lot of help there
[00:01:57] when it comes to memorizing.
[00:01:58] So without further ado,
[00:01:59] let's maybe go through
some of my favorite words
[00:02:02] that I've encountered so far
[00:02:03] and how I memorized them.
[00:02:05] (upbeat music)
[00:02:06] So the first one is this word spin.
[00:02:12] What does it mean?
[00:02:13] Spider, so if I put those together
[00:02:16] all I think of is basically
[00:02:18] that a spider spins a web.
[00:02:21] Right, makes sense?
[00:02:22] So this word was actually pretty easy
[00:02:24] because it almost means or
has part of it's meaning
[00:02:27] or something that it does
[00:02:29] applies to the actual
word in the definition.
[00:02:32] So that one's easy, spin spider.
[00:02:33] (upbeat music)
[00:02:36] Some of these words come up like this
[00:02:37] where they just sound pleasing
[00:02:39] and they're just inherently
memorable for that reason
[00:02:41] and I don't really use a technique.
[00:02:43] One of those words, in Dutch, is pompoen.
[00:02:46] Pompoen stands for pumpkin.
[00:02:49] And so it's pretty
close, pumpkin, pompoen.
[00:02:53] But I've been saying it to my kid
[00:02:55] over and over again.
[00:02:56] He loves the sound of it.
[00:02:56] The pompoen, the pompoen, the pompoen.
[00:03:01] So it's just kind of drilled
itself into my memory.
[00:03:02] And it just is easy and sounds fun.
[00:03:06] (upbeat music)
[00:03:07] This next one is a big
word, sinaasappelsap.
[00:03:11] And what it means is orange juice.
[00:03:14] So if I put those together
[00:03:15] I come up with a pretty in depth image,
[00:03:17] especially for that first word.
[00:03:18] So sinaasappelsap, I think of a sinus,
[00:03:21] I think of an apple,
[00:03:22] I think of tree sap,
[00:03:24] and that's sinaasappelsap.
[00:03:26] Sinus, apple, sap.
[00:03:28] Now I gotta relate that
to orange juice somehow.
[00:03:30] So I kind of make a little story
[00:03:32] connecting one to the other.
[00:03:33] So imagine that somebody sneezes
[00:03:36] because their sinuses are blocked up,
[00:03:38] out of their nose, their sinus area
[00:03:40] flies out an apple that kind
of transmorphs into sap,
[00:03:45] like a sappy apple.
[00:03:46] And it get's caught into
an orange juice cup.
[00:03:50] And maybe by the time it lands in the cup
[00:03:52] it's a beautiful glass of
Tropicana orange juice.
[00:03:57] So sinus apple sap orange juice.
[00:04:00] And that's it.
[00:04:01] That's a really great image in itself.
[00:04:03] And so when I see sinaasappelsap
[00:04:06] I can't help but think of the orange juice
[00:04:07] at the end of the story.
[00:04:09] And if I see orange juice
[00:04:10] I can't help think of the reverse.
[00:04:11] The sap apple sinus, sinaasappelsap.
[00:04:14] Say that 10 times.
[00:04:15] Sinaasappelsap, sinus apple.
[00:04:17] (upbeat music)
[00:04:19] This is one of my
absolute favorites so far
[00:04:21] is how to say mustache in
Dutch and it's snor, S-N-O-R.
[00:04:27] So I literally just picture
[00:04:30] a guy with a big mustache snoring.
[00:04:33] And I try give some action
and life to that picture.
[00:04:36] So I picture the little
hairs of his mustache
[00:04:39] kind of overhanging his mouth,
[00:04:41] flailing in the wind there
as he snores really loudly.
[00:04:45] Snor, mustache.
[00:04:46] (upbeat music)
[00:04:48] So now here's another
interesting thing in Dutch
[00:04:50] is as you learn kind of basic words
[00:04:52] you get these compound words
[00:04:53] that mean other words.
[00:04:54] So one good example is struisvogel
[00:04:58] which means ostrich.
[00:04:59] But if you break it into
parts, struis and vogel.
[00:05:03] Vogel is bird, ostrich is a bird.
[00:05:06] And struis which is stress.
[00:05:09] So it literally translates
to a stressed bird.
[00:05:12] (upbeat music)
[00:05:17] That image in itself
actually makes an ostrich,
[00:05:20] it makes sense for an ostrich.
[00:05:21] But it helps with the pictures.
[00:05:22] I just picture this stressed out ostrich,
[00:05:24] sticks it's head in the ground
to hide from the stress.
[00:05:27] That's a case where the
actual, literal meaning,
[00:05:29] even though it doesn't
mean ostrich, per se,
[00:05:31] makes it way more memorable.
[00:05:33] I can't think of another
stressed out bird but an ostrich.
[00:05:36] (upbeat music)
[00:05:38] And then you get words that are
[00:05:40] representing something
pretty simple in English.
[00:05:42] And then you get this
God forsaken huge word
[00:05:44] in the language.
[00:05:45] In this case, we're talking
about ladybug or ladybird,
[00:05:49] depending on where you're from.
[00:05:50] And the word is lieveheersbeestje,
[00:05:53] which is this huge word.
[00:05:55] I try to break it down into parts
[00:05:56] but I don't really know all
of what those words mean,
[00:05:59] except maybe beestje,
[00:06:00] I know that means beast or creature.
[00:06:01] And so lieveheers, actually
translates to lady.
[00:06:04] But that doesn't matter.
[00:06:05] Because in terms of my image,
[00:06:06] I gotta break it down to what it sounds
[00:06:07] like to me in English.
[00:06:08] So lieveheer sounds
like leave here, right?
[00:06:11] So I'm leaving something here.
[00:06:13] And then beestje makes
me think of a beast.
[00:06:15] It actually reads like a beast.
[00:06:17] So that actually works.
[00:06:17] So I imagine leaving here.
[00:06:20] At some point I leave here, a beast,
[00:06:22] maybe I hype it up that
it's some scary beast.
[00:06:24] And actually it's just this
tiny little ladybird, just tiny.
[00:06:28] So I leave here this beast.
[00:06:29] And it's kind of ironic, memorable,
[00:06:31] the fact that it's actually
a tiny, little ladybug beast.
[00:06:35] So that's it guys.
[00:06:36] Quick update, a few words that give you
[00:06:39] an insight into how I think about
[00:06:41] memorizing all these thousands of words
[00:06:43] that I'm going after.
[00:06:44] And how you could maybe take a language
[00:06:46] and learn some quick vocabulary.
[00:06:48] And I'll be back in about a month
[00:06:50] with another update
[00:06:51] with my progress learning Dutch.
[00:06:53] Thanks for watching, guys.
[00:06:54] As usual, like, subscribe, all the things.
[00:06:57] I'm out, da.

=== HOW TO CREATE MORE COMPLEX NUMBER SYSTEMS ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1IM-f23Cm4

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:03] what's up guys it's cold I'm up in the
[00:00:05] Adera for a couple weeks and I wanted to
[00:00:07] talk to you about how to memorize
[00:00:09] numbers with more complex number
[00:00:12] systems let's
[00:00:16] [Music]
[00:00:25] go all right so I've talked about a
[00:00:27] number of number systems before I've
[00:00:29] talked about the Pao right which was a
[00:00:32] two-digit system I've talked about the
[00:00:34] major system which is just basically
[00:00:36] coming up with words willy-nilly how you
[00:00:38] feel to represent numbers as words and
[00:00:41] so now I'm going to talk about a couple
[00:00:43] other options out there for those of you
[00:00:45] that want to take your number
[00:00:46] memorization game to a complete new
[00:00:50] level what kind of level am I talking
[00:00:53] about well Championship level right if
[00:00:55] you want to memorize thousands and
[00:00:56] thousands of digits of pi if you want to
[00:00:58] be able to memorize hundreds of digits
[00:01:00] in a very short amount of time these are
[00:01:02] the methods for you now I got to say
[00:01:05] this setting up one of these systems
[00:01:07] does take a lot of effort and time but
[00:01:10] the positive side of it is when you have
[00:01:12] it down and you've learned it it's with
[00:01:15] you forever and you can use it to
[00:01:17] memorize big numbers for the rest of
[00:01:18] your life it's a pretty good tradeoff in
[00:01:21] my opinion I think it's worth the effort
[00:01:23] so if in case you feel that way keep
[00:01:26] watching so the first one I'm want to
[00:01:28] talk to you about is a three-digit
[00:01:30] system and it's the simplest to set up
[00:01:32] in my opinion because it only needs
[00:01:34] 1,000 images over
[00:01:37] 9,000 I say only 1,000 that's still a
[00:01:40] lot I know but again you're watching
[00:01:41] this video cuz you're in it for the long
[00:01:43] haul so 1,000 images should seem pretty
[00:01:45] reasonable all right so how do you set
[00:01:47] up a three-digit major system system
[00:01:51] basically you know the major system in
[00:01:53] case you don't here's a quick recap
[00:01:56] [Music]
[00:02:04] got it so all you're doing for these
[00:02:06] three digits that you're looking at is
[00:02:08] giving them a consonant sound and then
[00:02:10] creating a word now it can sometimes be
[00:02:12] hard to come up with a word that has
[00:02:14] these three consonants in it but there's
[00:02:15] some great resources where you can get
[00:02:17] some suggestions for these numbers numsy
[00:02:20] is my go-to you plug in the number and
[00:02:22] it gives you options so an example might
[00:02:24] be maybe you have
[00:02:27] 357 MLK that's pretty easy I think of
[00:02:30] Martin Luther King that already is just
[00:02:32] three consonants that represents a name
[00:02:34] another option for that could be milk a
[00:02:37] carton of milk very simple object very
[00:02:40] easy image and m l k I just put one
[00:02:43] vowel in between the m and the L and I
[00:02:46] have my word milk here are a few other
[00:02:48] examples of three-digit numbers just to
[00:02:50] give you an idea
[00:02:55] [Music]
[00:03:04] now I know this seems like it's a lot of
[00:03:06] work again it is a lot of work you got
[00:03:08] to sit there and come up with your
[00:03:10] thousand images I know there's no way
[00:03:13] around it but remember once you have it
[00:03:14] it's yours now what do you do once you
[00:03:16] have a th000 images and you're looking
[00:03:18] at a number to memorize all right well
[00:03:20] people have different approaches here
[00:03:22] some people like to put two images per
[00:03:25] location some people like to put three
[00:03:27] images per location I don't really know
[00:03:29] anybody who does more than three I don't
[00:03:31] really know anybody who does just one
[00:03:32] image so if you're doing two that's six
[00:03:34] digits three and three if you're doing
[00:03:36] three obviously that's nine 3 3 three
[00:03:38] now just to let you know some of the top
[00:03:40] memorizers are actually just using the
[00:03:41] two so if you're trying to decide maybe
[00:03:44] go with what the Champions do and so
[00:03:46] let's say you have 3 five 7 which we've
[00:03:50] decided is a melt Carton and maybe the
[00:03:52] next three digits is 502 which in this
[00:03:56] system might be lasagna you would
[00:03:59] picture those two things together milk
[00:04:01] being poured all over your lasagna and
[00:04:03] now that suddenly represents six digits
[00:04:05] MLK for milk LSN for lasagna 357 502 and
[00:04:12] you repeat that process using a Memory
[00:04:13] Palace to get you through however many
[00:04:15] hundreds and thousands of digits you
[00:04:20] want all right let's say that you
[00:04:22] already did your Pao you have 100 people
[00:04:24] 100 action and 100 objects are there any
[00:04:27] options for you instead of just having
[00:04:29] to start over with a thousand major
[00:04:31] system images Yes actually and it's the
[00:04:34] system I use I call it kind of a
[00:04:36] category system and so if you have a
[00:04:38] two-digit Pao you have 100 people so
[00:04:41] let's say that for all those 100 people
[00:04:43] you consider them different categories
[00:04:45] so for my category system the way it
[00:04:46] works is I took my original 100 people
[00:04:49] from my Pao and I basically decided to
[00:04:51] come up with a th000 people so how to do
[00:04:54] that I basically let the two-digit
[00:04:55] person represent a category obviously
[00:04:57] from two to three digits you have that
[00:04:59] one extra digit it can be a possibility
[00:05:01] of 10 different things 0 through 9 I
[00:05:03] came up with 10 people in the category
[00:05:06] of that original two-digit person okay
[00:05:09] an example 15 is Albert Einstein you can
[00:05:12] do this two ways all the three-digit
[00:05:13] numbers that end in 15 15 will be of
[00:05:17] Albert Einstein category so maybe famous
[00:05:19] scientists or you can do all numbers
[00:05:21] that start with 15 and end with another
[00:05:24] digit the way I do it is basically
[00:05:27] 015 is the original person so Alber sent
[00:05:30] is 015 it's 15 right if you read it then
[00:05:32] 115 215 315 415 all the way to 915 are
[00:05:37] different scientists and I use kind of a
[00:05:40] mix between the Dominic system and a
[00:05:42] major system to treat that single digit
[00:05:45] as basically a sound that can remind me
[00:05:47] of the specific scientist so 8:15 for me
[00:05:51] is Richard Fineman Fineman F so the
[00:05:54] eight in the major system is an F sound
[00:05:57] so that helps me remember that okay
[00:05:59] we're dealing dealing with a 15 category
[00:06:01] that scientist 815 it's got to be an F
[00:06:04] sound so it's fan another example 72 was
[00:06:07] George Bush so my original 072 remains
[00:06:11] George Bush then 172 272 372 472 all the
[00:06:15] way to 972 are all former US presidents
[00:06:18] so 272 two I treat as either major
[00:06:22] system is an n Sound or in the Dominic
[00:06:24] system it's a b so I actually go with B
[00:06:27] which is Bill Clinton three 72 the three
[00:06:31] is a c so that's President Carter and
[00:06:33] you get the idea now what do you do with
[00:06:35] those thousand people okay you might be
[00:06:37] thinking okay well maybe if I want to
[00:06:38] keep my Pao I got to come up with a th
[00:06:40] actions and 1 th000 objects not really
[00:06:43] what I actually do is I use a th000
[00:06:45] people and I still use the two-digit
[00:06:47] action and the two-digit object so I'm
[00:06:49] doing Pao but with a slightly bigger
[00:06:52] thousand digigit person the nice thing
[00:06:53] about that is you can incrementally make
[00:06:55] that span more digits so if you want to
[00:06:58] start with a thousand people you can do
[00:07:00] that 322 person action object and still
[00:07:03] use your actions and objects from your
[00:07:05] two-digit system and then when you feel
[00:07:06] a little more comfortable you can
[00:07:08] actually increase how many objects you
[00:07:10] have to a th000 using the same kind of
[00:07:12] category system so then you can do 323
[00:07:14] which is memorizing eight digits at a
[00:07:16] time you'd have a th000 people still 100
[00:07:18] actions two digits and then a th000
[00:07:21] objects three digits for the object and
[00:07:23] then if you're up to it you can of
[00:07:24] course Advance your actions to a th000
[00:07:26] but I think that's pretty difficult now
[00:07:28] what you may gather is that this may
[00:07:31] seem like a lot of work and it is this
[00:07:33] is probably actually a lot more work but
[00:07:35] if you really like Pao which I do it
[00:07:37] feels like the best way to memorize for
[00:07:39] me it actually is worth it and I like
[00:07:41] having a thousand people it sounds like
[00:07:43] a lot but it's really not that bad
[00:07:44] thousand objects not that bad
[00:07:46] either so that's it folks are there
[00:07:49] other ways to memorize a lot of numbers
[00:07:51] are there other bigger systems yeah
[00:07:53] there's a few others but they're all
[00:07:54] basically different variations of what
[00:07:56] I've talked about most probably will
[00:07:58] tend to go to towards the major system
[00:08:00] just to have a th000 digits pretty
[00:08:02] simple done and done but again it's just
[00:08:04] a bit of elbow grease you got to get the
[00:08:06] work done to get that system going all
[00:08:08] right thanks guys for watching I hope
[00:08:09] that was a helpful video on how to set
[00:08:11] up a more complex number system so that
[00:08:13] you can memorize more faster a lot of
[00:08:15] you probably don't care to have a number
[00:08:17] system like that but in case you do
[00:08:19] hopefully this will get you started if
[00:08:20] you have any questions always feel free
[00:08:22] to send me a message I can maybe send
[00:08:24] you some of my number lists so that you
[00:08:26] know maybe where to start anyways that's
[00:08:28] it I'm out I'm about to head out on a
[00:08:29] big trip to Nepal and uh I'll see you
[00:08:32] when I get back please like subscribe
[00:08:34] share all things I'm out

=== THE DROPS 2K CHALLENGE (LEARNING DUTCH IN 90 DAYS) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzigH6t2ong

[00:00:00] Happy New Year guys welcome to 2019 man
[00:00:05] I am excited for this year I'm excited
[00:00:07] for every single year that passes but
[00:00:09] this year especially and I got a lot of
[00:00:12] projects coming up but the first one
[00:00:14] that I'm gonna tackle in these next 90
[00:00:16] days it's something I'm really super
[00:00:18] excited about we're calling it the drops
[00:00:20] 2k Challenge and what it is basically
[00:00:24] you ever seen this app it's basically a
[00:00:27] language learning app what I'm gonna be
[00:00:29] doing is choosing a language and taking
[00:00:31] 90 days to memorize all the words that
[00:00:34] they have in there which is 2,000 words
[00:00:36] plus or minus y 2,000 words well
[00:00:40] typically when you learn about 2,000 of
[00:00:42] the most frequently used words in the
[00:00:44] language it can give you a comprehension
[00:00:46] of about 80% of all reading material on
[00:00:49] average now this does not mean that I
[00:00:51] will be fluent in said language all it
[00:00:54] means is that I'll be able to recognize
[00:00:55] by sight and by sound what these words
[00:00:58] are and what they mean in English of
[00:01:00] course just a side note yes this is a
[00:01:02] paid partnership with drops but honestly
[00:01:05] I wouldn't accept this if I wasn't
[00:01:06] excited about and that's all that
[00:01:07] matters to me I something that I
[00:01:08] personally want to do anyways so what's
[00:01:10] the language the language of choice is
[00:01:12] going to be Dutch / Flemish kind of the
[00:01:17] same language same words just different
[00:01:19] pronunciations a little bit of almost
[00:01:21] like a different dialect but essentially
[00:01:23] Dutch now why Dutch well my mother is
[00:01:25] from Belgium
[00:01:29] my dad's French I grew up speaking
[00:01:31] French as my first language then I
[00:01:34] learned English but my mother always
[00:01:36] speaks Flemish / Dutch on the phone to
[00:01:39] her siblings to us even but I never
[00:01:42] picked up a single word growing up
[00:01:44] believe it or not I know a couple curse
[00:01:45] words I guess it would be super
[00:01:47] meaningful to me to be able to
[00:01:48] understand my mother for once after 35
[00:01:51] years of her speaking that language in
[00:01:53] my presence and also to potentially
[00:01:56] speak with some of my family that I've
[00:01:57] maybe never met so the challenge is
[00:01:59] 2,000 words 90 days using only the app
[00:02:03] itself so no extra apps no extra flash
[00:02:07] cards no extra conversing or listening
[00:02:10] to Dutch sources it's all going to be
[00:02:13] within
[00:02:13] app and I'm gonna be using it to learn
[00:02:16] these 2,000 words now along the way
[00:02:18] during these 90 days of course I'm gonna
[00:02:20] be updating you guys with how I'm doing
[00:02:22] this
[00:02:22] what challenges I'm facing is it easy
[00:02:25] for me as a memory champion is it harder
[00:02:27] than I thought is the app itself gonna
[00:02:30] make it easier for me
[00:02:31] well I have to actually in the end
[00:02:32] supplement my studying these words with
[00:02:35] some extra resources I don't know I'm
[00:02:37] hoping not to the goal is not to use
[00:02:39] that but we'll see I'm so excited about
[00:02:43] this in the meantime check out the app
[00:02:45] it's got about 31 languages at the
[00:02:47] moment that you can learn but I think
[00:02:48] they're always increasing those
[00:02:49] languages over time I'm actually a love
[00:02:51] with the aesthetic of the app how it
[00:02:53] looks how it feels it's a fun experience
[00:02:55] I played with all the other apps that
[00:02:57] you can imagine out there and not have
[00:02:59] really impressed me and made me want to
[00:03:00] keep using it so this one feels a bit
[00:03:02] different and that's why I accepted the
[00:03:04] challenge in the first place so it's
[00:03:06] 2019 I'm getting after my goals you
[00:03:09] better get out to yours thanks for
[00:03:10] watching guys please like subscribe and
[00:03:13] check out drops when you get a chance
[00:03:14] I'm out
[00:03:18] [Music]

=== THE LINKING METHOD (FASTEST WAY TO MEMORIZE ANYTHING!) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kclHY52NvhQ

[00:00:00] what's up everyone Nelson Dellis here
[00:00:01] and in today's episode we're going to
[00:00:03] talk about something I probably should
[00:00:05] have talked to you about a while ago and
[00:00:07] that is the fastest way to memorize any
[00:00:10] list hands down you want to know how to
[00:00:13] do it let's go alright so the name of
[00:00:21] the technique is the linking method it's
[00:00:23] been around for years it's super simple
[00:00:25] and basically what it is is what the
[00:00:28] name of the technique says it is linking
[00:00:30] information from one thing to the next
[00:00:32] so essentially you're just building a
[00:00:34] narrative from one item to the next that
[00:00:37] links them all together into one
[00:00:38] cohesive story so the idea is that when
[00:00:40] you picture it and of course the story
[00:00:42] needs to be very bizarre over-the-top
[00:00:44] whatever with all these images but they
[00:00:46] need to be connected that's that's
[00:00:47] important but the idea is that once you
[00:00:49] had it all connected to recall it you
[00:00:52] just start at the very first image and
[00:00:53] you just continue the chain the link
[00:00:56] till the end think of like a metal chain
[00:00:59] of links one is connected to the next
[00:01:00] that one's connected to the next one
[00:01:02] you've got to go from one to the other
[00:01:03] they are all connected into this one
[00:01:05] strand that's the idea so come up with a
[00:01:08] picture obviously for each thing make a
[00:01:10] connection between each subsequent image
[00:01:13] and that can be done in the number of
[00:01:14] ways maybe they touch each other or they
[00:01:17] interact with each other or they cause
[00:01:18] it's caused an effect that cause each
[00:01:20] other it's up to you just make it as
[00:01:22] memorable as possible now a couple
[00:01:24] caveats about this technique yes imagine
[00:01:27] you forget one of the links the rest of
[00:01:29] your images could be lost forever so
[00:01:30] maybe it's not the best technique to
[00:01:32] ensure that you have all the information
[00:01:34] but it is the quickest way if you're in
[00:01:36] a pinch and you want to memorize a list
[00:01:38] grocery list a list of information
[00:01:40] whatever just jump to the linking system
[00:01:42] you don't need any prep you don't need
[00:01:44] to build any memory palaces nada
[00:01:46] absolutely nada the best way to learn
[00:01:48] how to do this is to do an actual
[00:01:51] example so let me tell you a little
[00:01:53] story and you just have to listen all
[00:01:56] you have to do is listen and you will be
[00:01:58] hopefully memorizing but here we go
[00:02:00] start with imagining that you have a
[00:02:03] single Yukon potato
[00:02:06] throw it out the British Columbia then
[00:02:08] tells himself that he's got to get out
[00:02:10] of air goes to the Northwest he goes
[00:02:12] into hiding he finds a hideout with
[00:02:14] Albert who suddenly is like I will have
[00:02:17] none of it so he jets out of there and
[00:02:19] bumps into sasquatch he's cooking in man
[00:02:22] in the tub and flips this on switch that
[00:02:25] just tears the person apart you as an
[00:02:27] observer you suddenly start to be all
[00:02:29] pumped up adrenaline rushing you just
[00:02:31] want to save the guy so you say ok put
[00:02:33] him on your back came back and you make
[00:02:35] a run for it you find a new land filled
[00:02:37] with labs and spending the night there
[00:02:38] burning new wick candles and then as you
[00:02:42] go to bed you see big nova and the sky
[00:02:45] that you throw some kosher salt a cos
[00:02:47] it's part of your tradition and then
[00:02:48] when you wake up its Prince singing
[00:02:50] Purple Rain
[00:02:52] this giant had Prince head and the story
[00:02:57] freaking weird I know so weird what
[00:03:00] memorable and guess what it actually
[00:03:03] stands for something I don't know what
[00:03:04] it stands for that was actually all of
[00:03:06] the Canadian provinces and territories
[00:03:09] roughly from west to east if you were to
[00:03:12] look on a map so if you couldn't put it
[00:03:14] all together I'll break it down for you
[00:03:16] the Yukon Gold that's the Yukon
[00:03:18] Territories the British Columbian is
[00:03:20] British Columbia Northwest that's the
[00:03:22] Northwest Territories Fat Albert that's
[00:03:24] Alberta none of it is none of it I don't
[00:03:29] know how to pronounce that correctly but
[00:03:30] that's one of the territories then the
[00:03:32] Sasquatch was Saskatchewan man and of
[00:03:35] table is Manitoba on button tear that's
[00:03:38] Ontario okay back that's Quebec the
[00:03:42] Newfoundland that's Newfoundland and
[00:03:44] Labrador the new burning wick candles
[00:03:47] that's New Brunswick a bit of a stretch
[00:03:49] but you can get it from that image and
[00:03:51] then the Nova with the kosher salt
[00:03:53] that's Nova Scotia or also a stretch and
[00:03:56] then finally when you wake up its Prince
[00:03:58] with his head Prince Edward Prince
[00:04:01] Edward Island
[00:04:03] so that's it right so it was pretty easy
[00:04:06] just come up with a really weird story
[00:04:08] that kind of connects it all into one
[00:04:09] strand one narrative it's almost like
[00:04:12] storytelling it's not even almost a
[00:04:14] message or song a story with all these
[00:04:16] weird images in a certain order but
[00:04:18] that's the linking method so now when
[00:04:20] you're on the run you need to memorize
[00:04:21] something unless revert to the linking
[00:04:23] method and you'll save yourself you're
[00:04:25] welcome that's it for now
[00:04:27] love you guys subscribe like share all
[00:04:29] those things you know you know the drill
[00:04:30] you just you know it watch enough of
[00:04:33] these I'm out

=== Reviewing LUMOSITY'S "Memory Serves" game ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3j3w8Df8ZA

[00:00:00] what's up guys Nelson Dellis here in
[00:00:01] another episode of random memory tips
[00:00:03] and today we're doing something a little
[00:00:06] different we are reviewing a memory game
[00:00:10] I always give you tips on how to improve
[00:00:17] your memory but sometimes it takes
[00:00:19] practice and what's difficult about
[00:00:21] practice is finding some kind of task or
[00:00:24] game or or thing that will allow you to
[00:00:27] train your memory enjoyably so there
[00:00:30] aren't very many memory games out there
[00:00:31] but we're going to talk about one today
[00:00:34] that I'm happy to talk about and I'm
[00:00:36] kind of obsessed with it I haven't
[00:00:38] stopped playing it since I was
[00:00:40] introduced to it so yeah let's talk
[00:00:41] about it so the game we're gonna be
[00:00:48] reviewing today is by Lumosity and the
[00:00:51] game is called memory serves as you can
[00:00:53] tell by a title it has to do with memory
[00:00:55] of course and that is why I'm reviewing
[00:00:57] it now a quick disclaimer I'm not being
[00:00:59] paid by Lumosity to say anything about
[00:01:01] this game so this is just me being super
[00:01:03] honest about their products so the
[00:01:07] premise of the game is this you're a
[00:01:09] bellhop in a hotel and you're picking up
[00:01:11] and delivering bags there's different
[00:01:13] kinds of bags colors shapes and you have
[00:01:16] to keep track of how many you have in
[00:01:19] your inventory and how many are being
[00:01:21] requested of you to be delivered so
[00:01:23] what's cool about this is yes it's
[00:01:25] testing your working memory but it's
[00:01:27] more of this kind of memory updating
[00:01:30] right so you have some numerical
[00:01:31] transformation that's happening to a
[00:01:33] value that's sitting in your working
[00:01:35] memory and you have to constantly
[00:01:36] remember it but also updated as it
[00:01:39] changes enough of the talking let's
[00:01:41] actually maybe try a couple and see how
[00:01:43] it actually plays all right so here's
[00:01:47] the game basically all you got to
[00:01:50] remember is how to press the spacebar
[00:01:51] that's super easy
[00:01:52] you're either off loading bags or you're
[00:01:55] not that's it
[00:01:56] you just gotta memorize the rest
[00:01:59] this is a minute 25 here 3 2 1 go I have
[00:02:03] no bags all right so one yellow to blue
[00:02:12] to more blue sand I'll have 4 blue 1
[00:02:16] yellow 5 blue 1 yellow so I have 2 to
[00:02:23] give so now I have 3 blue 1 yellow add 2
[00:02:28] more yellow so I have 3 3 I have 1/3
[00:02:32] I have 1 4 1 5 I have five yellows three
[00:02:46] yellows I do a little bit of math there
[00:02:49] with one yellow left nothing else see I
[00:02:53] do not have the blue seal II don't want
[00:02:55] I do not have two yellow so I leave that
[00:02:56] along to blue 1 yellow give one away 1
[00:03:02] blue 1 yellow I don't have to so now
[00:03:06] three blue 1 yellow to blue 1 yellow 3
[00:03:13] blue 1 yellow 5 blue four blue 1 yellow
[00:03:22] for blue to yellow
[00:03:27] four blue zero and that's it I beat the
[00:03:31] level that wasn't too bad 12 out of 12
[00:03:33] accuracy 100% nice but you didn't see
[00:03:36] how that could get a little trickier
[00:03:38] right as you add more bags and as you
[00:03:40] you know incrementally small amounts
[00:03:43] take them out add them in so you get the
[00:03:46] idea I mean these games are are great
[00:03:48] because it's like actually working your
[00:03:50] working memory you can sort of have a
[00:03:53] little bit of a technique like you saw I
[00:03:55] was saying the numbers out loud in my
[00:03:56] head I'm actually visualizing the image
[00:03:58] I have associated for you know 132 or
[00:04:01] 101 or one to zero
[00:04:05] but that's just for split-second to hold
[00:04:07] it I don't really need it past the
[00:04:11] moment I drop off a single bad because
[00:04:13] then I'm updating it to a new number
[00:04:15] that I have to remember it's a good
[00:04:16] workout it really feels something kind
[00:04:18] of different that I never really trained
[00:04:20] with my other memory exercises so I'd
[00:04:23] like that and what's great the science
[00:04:25] even says this is that the more you
[00:04:27] train this kind of stuff the actual
[00:04:29] better you get and yes that's obviously
[00:04:32] clear with memory techniques if you
[00:04:34] train techniques you'll get better at
[00:04:36] them but sometimes there's certain
[00:04:38] memorization of stuff that's kind of
[00:04:40] beyond techniques and it's not always
[00:04:43] clear that that improves with practice
[00:04:44] in this case though the science says
[00:04:46] that it will improve if you practice it
[00:04:48] so as you can see the games actually
[00:04:49] pretty fun and looks beautiful and I've
[00:04:52] gotten pretty far the first time I
[00:04:54] actually tested this out for them I beat
[00:04:55] all the levels it went up to like 55 I
[00:04:58] told that and they've rewritten it so
[00:04:59] they've made it a little harder which I
[00:05:01] have super appreciate because there's
[00:05:03] nothing that I like better than a bit of
[00:05:04] the challenge all right guys go to
[00:05:07] Lumosity comm check out this game memory
[00:05:09] serves it's well worth to check out I
[00:05:11] really like it highly recommend it or we
[00:05:14] give it stars out of 10 let's say 9 out
[00:05:17] of 10 there's always room for
[00:05:19] improvement hopefully in future I'll try
[00:05:20] to do more reviews I know you guys love
[00:05:22] different kinds of ways to train your
[00:05:23] memory so I'll try to share those and
[00:05:26] I'll see you the next video please like
[00:05:28] subscribe all those things love you guys
[00:05:29] I'm out

=== MEMORIZE A PHONE NUMBER INSTANTLY (NO SYSTEM NEEDED!) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ip0xFIPuhc

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:02] what's going on guys Nelson dolls for
[00:00:05] time USA memory champion here and I'm
[00:00:07] gonna teach you today how to remember a
[00:00:09] single phone number number now I've done
[00:00:11] videos before on how to memorize numbers
[00:00:14] different systems the Dominick's system
[00:00:16] the major system and I wanted to make a
[00:00:19] videos that kind of shied away from
[00:00:20] systems that you have to pre create I
[00:00:23] wanted to make a video on how to
[00:00:24] remember a number with as minimal leave
[00:00:27] of homework as possible here are a few
[00:00:30] tips on how to do that with numbers
[00:00:32] let's go
[00:00:34] [Music]
[00:00:44] honestly if you did this you probably
[00:00:47] remember a number better than any of the
[00:00:49] other techniques I'm gonna give you pay
[00:00:51] the Frick attention just pay attention
[00:00:55] if you put down your phone for a second
[00:00:57] look the person in the eye
[00:00:58] who's telling you the number or look at
[00:01:00] the number try to like absorb it as best
[00:01:03] as you can
[00:01:04] telling yourself I need to remember this
[00:01:07] number or else
[00:01:08] chances are you gonna remember it better
[00:01:10] than if you just try to automatically
[00:01:11] say oh I'm just gonna put in my phone or
[00:01:13] you say I'll just text me the number
[00:01:14] I'll I'll call you back later no try to
[00:01:17] actually focus on the bearing number how
[00:01:20] hard is that right alright the second
[00:01:24] tip I can give you is to actually try to
[00:01:26] break the number up into little sections
[00:01:28] I like to call chunks yeah not that
[00:01:32] chunk I mean separating them into actual
[00:01:35] chunks what this does is if you see a
[00:01:37] number of digits all kind of crammed
[00:01:40] together it just looks like a really
[00:01:42] complicated number but if you break it
[00:01:43] up into something that looks like a
[00:01:45] phone number or maybe even just small
[00:01:47] little pairs or triplets suddenly it
[00:01:50] just looks like a smaller amount of
[00:01:52] groups of digits and that for some
[00:01:55] reason is easier for our brains to
[00:01:56] consolidate and remember look at the
[00:02:00] number after you break it up into chunks
[00:02:02] and just see if anything comes to mind
[00:02:04] without any systems just look at the
[00:02:07] numbers and try to make sense of it
[00:02:08] whether it's interesting play on the
[00:02:10] pattern of the numbers maybe some
[00:02:12] mathematical properties that just come
[00:02:14] to mind let's say that the area code is
[00:02:16] three one two that was the time when I
[00:02:18] was in high school that our class is let
[00:02:20] out at three twelve so that reminds me
[00:02:22] when I see three one two I think oh
[00:02:24] that's when I got out of school so I'd
[00:02:26] help myself remember that by thinking of
[00:02:28] that and maybe the next few remind me of
[00:02:30] how long it takes a pretty good runner
[00:02:32] to run a mile something like that right
[00:02:34] so you kind of pull on these different
[00:02:35] influences and experiences you have to
[00:02:37] maybe make sense of the numbers the
[00:02:39] point being try to make sense out of the
[00:02:41] numbers
[00:02:42] I did a video about a year ago on how to
[00:02:45] remember lines and it was this crazy
[00:02:47] hack where you would write down the
[00:02:48] first letter of each word and somehow it
[00:02:51] just stuck so I wanted to come up with a
[00:02:53] technique for memorizing a single phone
[00:02:55] number that was kind of a similar now
[00:02:57] the whole premise of how that technique
[00:02:59] worked for the poetry and the lines was
[00:03:01] essentially as a very basic explanation
[00:03:04] is that you're paying a great amount of
[00:03:06] attention to what you're memorizing by
[00:03:08] reading it by writing it by writing the
[00:03:10] first letter by rehearsing in a few
[00:03:12] times you're essentially without really
[00:03:14] realizing it giving that stuff a lot of
[00:03:17] love so same with the number I mean you
[00:03:21] want to give that number some love for
[00:03:23] it to stay there's three steps I want
[00:03:25] you to do talk about a phone number
[00:03:27] write an american phone number that has
[00:03:29] it area code three digits and then the
[00:03:30] four digits now I know a lot of you who
[00:03:32] watch my videos are not necessarily from
[00:03:34] the United States I'm sorry but I'm
[00:03:36] basically getting out here is try to
[00:03:37] break the number into smaller chunks so
[00:03:40] that you're dealing with smaller sets
[00:03:41] number not the whole thing as a whole
[00:03:43] all right so the first step is to
[00:03:45] obviously read the number right so let's
[00:03:47] say we have five one eight six seven
[00:03:51] five zero three two one if I write it
[00:03:55] like this right that's what the number
[00:03:57] looks like but instead I want to try to
[00:03:58] write it on top of each other so five
[00:04:01] one eight six seven five zero three two
[00:04:05] one
[00:04:06] just like that next step is to write it
[00:04:09] out again try not to cheat and look but
[00:04:11] if you have to look at the original
[00:04:13] number that's fine so what I want you to
[00:04:14] do is to write the number in the same
[00:04:16] format vertically but leave out the
[00:04:19] middle digit okay so five blank eight
[00:04:23] six blank five Oh blank blank once that
[00:04:29] last four digits just put the double
[00:04:31] blank what do you then do now is then if
[00:04:34] you can remember it great if not just
[00:04:36] refer back to where you wrote before and
[00:04:37] try to fill in the middle number right
[00:04:40] so five eight five one eight six seven
[00:04:44] five and then oh three two one next step
[00:04:49] do the same thing but leave out the last
[00:04:51] digit on each row so you
[00:04:53] would have five one blank six seven
[00:04:56] blank
[00:04:57] Oh three two blank and let's try to fill
[00:05:01] it in again it's okay if you cheat and
[00:05:03] look to remind yourself so five one
[00:05:06] eight six seven five zero three two one
[00:05:12] then the last step do the same thing but
[00:05:15] leave off the first digit so blank one
[00:05:18] eight blank seven five blank three two
[00:05:23] one and then you fill in the blank so it
[00:05:26] was five one eight six seven five oh
[00:05:31] three two one and now if you close your
[00:05:34] eyes
[00:05:35] and you think a little bit the number
[00:05:37] should be there five one eight six seven
[00:05:40] five zero three two one nice and I can
[00:05:45] see it because I've written it down so
[00:05:47] many times I can almost see the number
[00:05:48] in my mind and especially the fact that
[00:05:50] I have to write in some of those missing
[00:05:51] digits just help somehow cement it in
[00:05:54] your mind now this isn't the best
[00:05:56] technique to keep something in your
[00:05:58] long-term forever you do have to do a
[00:06:00] bit of work with imagery and storage
[00:06:03] using a memory palace or whatever if you
[00:06:05] want to keep numbers forever but this
[00:06:07] video is just designed to teach you one
[00:06:08] number when you're in a pinch and you
[00:06:10] want to actually hold it for just a
[00:06:12] little while I'm leading up to a video
[00:06:15] where I'm going to talk about how to
[00:06:16] memorise massive numbers using a large
[00:06:19] system so look out for that
[00:06:21] I'm working on my ten thousand digits of
[00:06:23] pi haven't had a crazy amount of time
[00:06:25] but I'm working every thousand here and
[00:06:27] there every few days that I got a chance
[00:06:28] so I will have a video coming out on
[00:06:30] that very soon and then shortly after my
[00:06:34] demonstration of memorizing ten thousand
[00:06:35] digits of pi all right guys that's it
[00:06:38] for now a very short video a very simple
[00:06:40] video if none of those techniques work
[00:06:42] for you I know they're very simple but
[00:06:44] if none of them work you can always do
[00:06:46] this
[00:06:52] that's it for this video thanks so much
[00:06:54] for watching I'll be back soon with
[00:06:56] another video and as usual subscribe
[00:06:59] like share these big things all over the
[00:07:01] place yeah you haven't done my book yet
[00:07:03] you can learn more of this stuff you
[00:07:05] don't have to watch these videos it's
[00:07:06] called remember it's available pretty
[00:07:07] much everywhere so just look for on the
[00:07:09] internet or in book stores anyways I'm
[00:07:12] out love you guys

=== PIZZA IS HOME ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4RqZtYZ2-U

[00:00:00] Pizza has always played a big part of my
[00:00:03] life no matter where it was it's always
[00:00:05] been a food I've been able to count on
[00:00:06] to bring me home Pizza is a food like no
[00:00:09] other one that always gives me a sense
[00:00:11] of comfort and peace and appreciation
[00:00:13] for food and culture
[00:00:14] and most importantly a happy stomach in
[00:00:17] 2015 I moved to New York City to immerse
[00:00:19] myself in one of the largest pizza
[00:00:21] cultures on earth I met a girl who was
[00:00:24] crazy enough to join me on a thorough
[00:00:26] taste test of all the $1 slice pizza
[00:00:28] stores Manhattan had to offer
[00:00:30] yeah all of them fast forward a bit and
[00:00:33] now we're married with kids and an
[00:00:35] insatiable appetite for life travel and
[00:00:38] of course pizza
[00:00:39] I love making pizza I love the process
[00:00:42] the detail that goes into every
[00:00:44] ingredient I had how it brings people
[00:00:46] together makes people smile and laugh so
[00:00:50] it goes without saying that any
[00:00:51] opportunity to make more pizza to
[00:00:53] showcase it share it with others is it
[00:00:56] must-have for me


=== THROW THE PEN METHOD!! // RANDOM MEMORY TIPS 18.15 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwh_tZUJXOY

[00:00:00] have you ever found yourself in a
[00:00:02] situation where you're asleep and you
[00:00:04] have an idea you're on the toilet and
[00:00:06] you have an idea your hands are full and
[00:00:08] you have an idea you're cooking and you
[00:00:11] have an idea you're just busy and you
[00:00:13] have an idea or a thought that you need
[00:00:14] to remember by this technique that I
[00:00:16] call the throw the pen method which
[00:00:18] literally has you throwing a pen or any
[00:00:22] nearby easy to throw item but this
[00:00:25] technique is gonna make you say just wow
[00:00:27] just wow wow wow damn yeah wow that's
[00:00:31] some good yeah Wow
[00:00:34] yeah the technique works like this you
[00:00:36] have something that you're wanting to
[00:00:39] remember but you're just in a situation
[00:00:40] where you can't free yourself up you
[00:00:42] just got something going on just don't
[00:00:44] want to forget this item you'll take
[00:00:45] care of it later what you do is you take
[00:00:47] some nearby objects the lightest and
[00:00:50] quickest and smallest easiest thing you
[00:00:52] can get you can take a pen you could
[00:00:53] take a credit card you could take a
[00:00:55] mints you could take a book piece of
[00:00:57] food it doesn't matter it's just gonna
[00:00:59] be something that's noticeable and
[00:01:00] something that you will notice is out of
[00:01:03] place if you put it out of place in
[00:01:05] short the best thing you can choose is
[00:01:07] whatever is closest to you so what then
[00:01:10] you take this item you throw it in a
[00:01:12] place where you know that your future
[00:01:15] self will encounter it so that typically
[00:01:18] means say if you're in bed you just
[00:01:20] throw it on the floor because when you
[00:01:21] wake up you're gonna get out of the bed
[00:01:22] and see the thing on the floor if you're
[00:01:25] on your couch maybe it's on the floor
[00:01:27] but in the direction where you're
[00:01:28] probably gonna get up from the couch and
[00:01:30] walk over past it if you're on the
[00:01:32] toilet then maybe on the floor so that's
[00:01:34] on your way out of the bathroom so
[00:01:35] somewhere near you but somewhere that's
[00:01:37] kind of in your way next once you've
[00:01:40] thrown the item on the floor the next
[00:01:42] thing you gotta do is come up with a
[00:01:43] picture where the thing that you're
[00:01:44] trying to remember in the future and
[00:01:46] then attach it to that item you threw so
[00:01:49] in the example of me throwing a pen I'm
[00:01:51] going to come up with a picture for the
[00:01:52] thing I want to memorize and attach it
[00:01:54] to that that way
[00:01:55] future Nelson or a future you when you
[00:01:58] come across the thing that you threw
[00:02:00] it's gonna be so out of place that first
[00:02:01] of all you'll notice it a random pound
[00:02:03] on the floor random book just out of
[00:02:05] place on the floor mind you this may not
[00:02:07] work so well if your floor is cluttered
[00:02:09] and you're a hoarder and your floor is
[00:02:11] just a mess yeah so make sure your floor
[00:02:12] is clean
[00:02:13] where you do this but no so you're gonna
[00:02:15] encounter this thing and it's gonna have
[00:02:17] an association to it because you
[00:02:20] attached an image to that physical thing
[00:02:22] so when I see the pen I'm gonna run into
[00:02:24] it now I'm going to say like that pen
[00:02:26] had an image of so-and-so and that's
[00:02:29] going to remind the other thing I had to
[00:02:30] do so it's a way of externalizing a
[00:02:33] memory that you don't need to really try
[00:02:36] to encode in your mind you're encoding
[00:02:38] it on the external thing that your
[00:02:40] future self will deal with all right
[00:02:44] let's say you're in bed it's in the
[00:02:46] middle of the night or it's late at
[00:02:47] night when suddenly you have an idea or
[00:02:50] thought something that you can't go to
[00:02:52] bed without resolving just something for
[00:02:54] tomorrow that you have to take care of
[00:02:55] and you know that you're gonna forget it
[00:02:57] if you don't write it down or do
[00:02:58] anything about it so you kind of get
[00:03:00] antsy and you feel like you gotta get up
[00:03:02] and take care of it no need my friend
[00:03:03] here's what you do I have a few things
[00:03:05] here I have a couple books and this
[00:03:07] trusted pen I would take this pen
[00:03:09] literally just throw it on the floor out
[00:03:12] the door so I know that when I wake up
[00:03:13] I'm gonna come across it that pen is
[00:03:15] gonna stick out so I'll notice it in the
[00:03:17] morning the next thing is to come up
[00:03:19] with an image for whatever it is I'm
[00:03:21] trying to remember and attach it to the
[00:03:23] pen let's say the thing I need to
[00:03:24] remember is I got an email Brian before
[00:03:27] 8:00 a.m. tomorrow Brian I think of a
[00:03:30] brain because they look like the same
[00:03:32] word Brian brain I'm gonna picture his
[00:03:34] brain covered in typing keys as if I
[00:03:36] gotta type something and a little
[00:03:37] envelope on the brain
[00:03:39] and I'm gonna stick that pen right into
[00:03:42] the middle of the brain and that is
[00:03:43] honestly it it's the easiest technique
[00:03:46] ever and it's quick harmless really
[00:03:48] efficient and now go back to bed not
[00:03:50] even worry about that and when you wake
[00:03:52] up you're gonna see the pen and be like
[00:03:54] oh there was a brain there with keys on
[00:03:57] it I got an email Brian right no so
[00:04:00] that's it guys quick little tip to help
[00:04:02] you memorize stuff on the fly my book
[00:04:05] remember it it's chock full of stuff

=== PETER MCKINNON READ MY BOOK!! (AND YOU SHOULD TO) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1pyM4r1Ev0

[00:00:00] oh snap you know this is do you know
[00:00:19] what this is this is this this is this
[00:00:25] is seven years of hard work right here
[00:00:30] in this package man I'm sorry I'm
[00:00:33] waiting to open this with you guys
[00:00:35] because I've yet to hold it in my hands
[00:00:38] for real
[00:00:39] final version it's my book my funding
[00:00:43] memory how to book
[00:00:48] [Music]
[00:00:57] hmm and ask for the clickbait title yeah
[00:01:01] that that didn't happen yet
[00:01:03] well it did it did happen yeah sort of
[00:01:06] I'll talk about that in a moment let's
[00:01:08] open this shall we
[00:01:12] okay maybe I didn't need the knife
[00:01:14] [Applause]
[00:01:24] Wow
[00:01:29] that is awesome that was awesome
[00:01:35] it's got a good heft to it it's got that
[00:01:37] fold in kind of cover that's awesome
[00:01:40] dude
[00:01:40] look at that look at that cover my name
[00:01:44] on it
[00:01:44] Joshua fours awesome endorsement on the
[00:01:47] back author moonwalking with Einstein
[00:01:49] here it is let's open it up all the
[00:01:53] pages are good the page oh my god
[00:01:55] oh love it
[00:01:59] dude oh my god awesome so
[00:02:03] awesome
[00:02:03] I'm sorry I'm just personally I'm
[00:02:06] excited about this it's just like this
[00:02:08] is this is everything that I have like
[00:02:11] bled and sweated over for the past seven
[00:02:16] years finally in a form that I can hold
[00:02:19] and it's just me this is me every from
[00:02:23] here to here it's me
[00:02:25] obviously it's specifically about memory
[00:02:27] but there's so much of like my history
[00:02:29] and my stories and my ideas whether
[00:02:32] they're good or bad it doesn't matter
[00:02:34] it's all like encapsulated in this book
[00:02:36] what's even better is I had an
[00:02:38] illustrator help with the making this
[00:02:40] book just pop his name is Adam Hayes he
[00:02:43] did an awesome job the forward is by
[00:02:46] Sanjay Gupta a well-known neurosurgeon
[00:02:48] what is it about all right so it's
[00:02:50] called remember it the names of people
[00:02:52] you meet all of your passwords where you
[00:02:54] left your keys and everything else you
[00:02:55] tend to forget I should probably
[00:02:56] memorize that so when I say the book
[00:02:58] title I know what it is but I always
[00:02:59] call it just remember it it's about 250
[00:03:01] to 300 pages very colorful lots of
[00:03:04] illustrations the whole point of the
[00:03:05] color thing is that I wanted to make
[00:03:07] how-to memory book that was memorable
[00:03:10] I felt like too many memory books out
[00:03:11] there so dry that's sure if you're
[00:03:13] interested in improving your memory
[00:03:15] you're gonna read it fine but for the
[00:03:16] average person who struggles with memory
[00:03:18] and may see this book sitting at the
[00:03:20] airport you know they're gonna be drawn
[00:03:23] to it it's a memorable color and cover
[00:03:26] and the inside just looks like fun and
[00:03:28] you think memory fun are
[00:03:30] I'm gonna give it a shot and hopefully
[00:03:31] they have a good time reading about
[00:03:33] memory which I had an amazing time
[00:03:35] learning about memory and I want to
[00:03:36] share that with people too so hopefully
[00:03:38] that book does it and what it is it's
[00:03:40] basically a book on how to remember the
[00:03:44] day to day things I do go deep into some
[00:03:47] things how to remember big numbers and
[00:03:49] decks of cards and stuff like that kind
[00:03:51] of the showstopper stuff that I do at
[00:03:53] competitions but I also focus on the
[00:03:55] more useful practical stuff where you
[00:03:57] left your keys passwords where you
[00:04:00] parked your car when you meet people how
[00:04:02] to remember their name how to remember
[00:04:04] poems or speeches or why you walked into
[00:04:07] a room simple stuff but there are some
[00:04:09] nuggets of cool little tips and the best
[00:04:11] thing you know I think is it's from my
[00:04:15] voice it's me you know there are memory
[00:04:17] books out there they all say the same
[00:04:18] thing and to an extent my book is
[00:04:20] harping on the same techniques that have
[00:04:22] been around for thousands of years just
[00:04:24] my interpretation of them and everything
[00:04:27] I figured out on my own through my
[00:04:29] memory championship escapades so there
[00:04:33] it's a book for everyone everybody can
[00:04:34] take away something from this book and
[00:04:36] the nice thing about it is you don't
[00:04:38] really have to read it linearly you can
[00:04:40] kind of open up to where you want to
[00:04:41] improve your memory so if you're
[00:04:43] struggling with names you can turn to
[00:04:45] that chapter and read it and then close
[00:04:48] the book and then put it down and then
[00:04:50] come back look up something about
[00:04:51] numbers and you don't have to read it
[00:04:53] from the front to back and I like that
[00:04:55] so it's kind of like an on-the-go book
[00:04:56] it's fun it's great gifts whatever it's
[00:04:59] awesome it's coming out September 25th
[00:05:01] you can pre-order it on all the online
[00:05:04] bookstores I'll put a link down here but
[00:05:08] it's on Amazon it's on Barnes and Nobles
[00:05:11] all those guys remember it what's up
[00:05:13] what's up what's up what's up what's up
[00:05:16] what's up everybody Peter McKinnon
[00:05:17] hearing what's up everybody
[00:05:19] so did Peter McKinnon read my book at
[00:05:21] the time of this video no in real life
[00:05:25] no but I had a dream before this book
[00:05:29] got here that I was helping Peter with a
[00:05:33] filming project and he was doing some
[00:05:37] work out I think he was doing burpees
[00:05:38] with a backpack on
[00:05:40] and inside the backpack was a ton of
[00:05:43] copies of my book and he just had them
[00:05:46] on them he had read the book in my dream
[00:05:48] and I was just helping him on a on a
[00:05:51] shoot yeah super weird I will go from
[00:05:54] that dream like that didn't make any
[00:05:55] sense but I said to myself dude
[00:05:57] Peter McKinnon read my book Peter
[00:05:59] McKinnon read my book then I also
[00:06:02] realize he actually didn't so I should
[00:06:04] probably send him a copy so I figured
[00:06:06] why not send him one of the two advance
[00:06:09] copies that I have I know he loves magic
[00:06:11] and stuff that kind of tickles the mind
[00:06:13] and this really does Peter I know
[00:06:17] you love cards so if you want to learn
[00:06:19] how to memorize a deck of cards it's in
[00:06:21] here now will he actually get the
[00:06:23] package and open it and read it and
[00:06:25] enjoy it
[00:06:26] most of those yes but the key is that he
[00:06:29] opens it and reads it right so we'll see
[00:06:31] I'm gonna just shoot it out into the
[00:06:33] universe hopefully it ends up in his
[00:06:34] hands and I hope he enjoys it I'm gonna
[00:06:37] go write him a note and pack this thing
[00:06:38] up and send it off let's do it

[00:00:01] [Music]
[00:00:07] [Music]
[00:00:30] [Music]
[00:00:37] [Music]
[00:00:57] yes yes
[00:01:01] [Music]
[00:01:07] it is I Nelson Dellis I want to say it
[00:01:12] you you know it for time memory champ
[00:01:15] yeah not five times before ten all right
[00:01:18] so today we're talking about how to
[00:01:20] solve a 2x2 Rubik's Cube blindfolded now
[00:01:27] there's tons of tutorials on the YouTube
[00:01:29] on YouTube there's tons of tutorials on
[00:01:32] YouTube that are great I am NOT a
[00:01:34] professional cube or by any means so I
[00:01:37] probably don't have any clout when it
[00:01:39] comes to explaining how to do this but
[00:01:41] where I probably have some helpful tips
[00:01:44] is how to do it blindfolded which is all
[00:01:46] about memory I'm gonna talk about a few
[00:01:48] things obviously one is how to do it but
[00:01:50] before we go any further I need the
[00:01:52] viewers you guys to know a little bit
[00:01:54] about how the cube works and how to
[00:01:56] hopefully solve it just regularly as a
[00:01:58] prerequisite I want you guys to know
[00:02:00] just kind of how to visualize the cube
[00:02:03] in your head so when you move pieces and
[00:02:05] you make moves you really kind of
[00:02:07] understand what's going on with the cube
[00:02:08] I'm gonna try to give as many simple
[00:02:11] tips as possible but in the case that I
[00:02:13] suck and in the case that this isn't a
[00:02:15] very good tutorial cuz I'm not cuber I'm
[00:02:17] just giving you that warning so you can
[00:02:18] go elsewhere and then hopefully come
[00:02:20] back and hopefully then my tips will be
[00:02:21] helpful
[00:02:24] what I want you to know about the cube
[00:02:26] obviously is that there are six faces
[00:02:28] and that they are all different colors
[00:02:31] some cubes have different colored
[00:02:33] stickers I like to have the light on top
[00:02:35] the yellow on the bottom the green
[00:02:37] facing me
[00:02:38] usually like this okay the blue in the
[00:02:40] back and then orange left and the red
[00:02:44] right so for for you if you're looking
[00:02:46] at this cube solving it in your hands
[00:02:49] right you have the green facing you got
[00:02:51] white on top blue in the back orange to
[00:02:54] the left and red to the right and yellow
[00:02:56] on the bottom now the next thing is the
[00:02:58] nomenclature for the different sides and
[00:03:00] how to learn algorithms algorithm is
[00:03:02] just a fancy word we're saying the
[00:03:04] instructions of what you should turn in
[00:03:06] what order and how many times or
[00:03:07] whatever basically how it works is this
[00:03:10] top face the white if you turn that it's
[00:03:14] you you four up if you rotate the bottom
[00:03:17] one that's d4 down if you rotate the
[00:03:19] back one this one that's B if you rotate
[00:03:23] F the front that's this one
[00:03:25] if you rotate L that's the left that's
[00:03:28] this guy
[00:03:28] if you rotate R that's this one so
[00:03:31] you'll see algorithms that look like
[00:03:33] this that mean basically in that order
[00:03:35] turn these in sequence now you'll notice
[00:03:38] some of them have little dashes there
[00:03:39] those are I call them Prime and
[00:03:41] basically if it doesn't have the Prime
[00:03:43] you're gonna turn that face clockwise if
[00:03:45] it has a little prime little mark there
[00:03:47] you're gonna do anti clockwise
[00:03:49] counterclockwise
[00:03:52] actually only one algorithm one
[00:03:55] algorithm to be able to solve this one
[00:03:58] algorithm so on one hand you have to be
[00:04:02] able to remember that algorithm and know
[00:04:04] it with your eyes closed then you also
[00:04:08] need to have some code to remember so
[00:04:11] that you know where to put pieces when
[00:04:13] your eyes are closed so there's two
[00:04:15] pieces of memorization there one is the
[00:04:17] algorithm which I'll teach you and
[00:04:18] second is the actual you know you're
[00:04:21] given a scrambled cube and you have to
[00:04:23] memorize that before you solve it okay
[00:04:25] first let's start with the algorithm
[00:04:26] that you need to know and all it is is
[00:04:28] something called a y perm which stands
[00:04:31] for a Y permutation why the Y I don't
[00:04:35] know because it looks like a Y when you
[00:04:36] do it I guess basically what it does is
[00:04:38] it swaps two pieces if it's facing you
[00:04:42] this sticker and this sticker that
[00:04:44] points out here so these two will be
[00:04:46] swapped nothing else will be changed now
[00:04:49] obviously when you're moving it around
[00:04:50] it looks like it's being changed but
[00:04:51] when it's done you've completely
[00:04:53] algorithm this cube has changed and this
[00:04:55] one has changed they're swamped now you
[00:04:57] can take advantage of that you can see
[00:04:59] where each piece needs to go and you
[00:05:00] bring it to one of these locations to
[00:05:03] get swapped you can do a series of swaps
[00:05:06] to eventually get it to look like this
[00:05:08] so this is what the algorithm looks like
[00:05:10] in terms of letters and this is what it
[00:05:14] looks like when you actually are solving
[00:05:16] it in slow-mo now remember you have the
[00:05:18] white on the top green in the front you
[00:05:20] can change it if you want but for us to
[00:05:22] be consistent here that's the way I'm
[00:05:24] going to do it are you prime R prime u
[00:05:28] prime R u R prime F prime R u R prime u
[00:05:35] prime R prime F R sounds like a friggin
[00:05:38] mouthful
[00:05:39] and now as you'll see those two pieces
[00:05:41] swapped everything else looks good just
[00:05:45] those two pieces swamped cool my
[00:05:47] recommendations for memorizing that you
[00:05:50] can come up with some kind of mnemonic
[00:05:52] system to represent the R and you
[00:05:54] and prime whatever but honestly that's
[00:05:57] not gonna help you because you have
[00:05:58] other stuff to memorize later I think
[00:06:00] the best thing to do is just to do it by
[00:06:01] rote muscle memory do it over it over
[00:06:05] again in your hand so that you get
[00:06:07] faster and faster now what helps me is I
[00:06:09] try to break up little sections and get
[00:06:11] good at that so the first part which is
[00:06:14] the bar u prime R u prime R prime u
[00:06:22] prime R u R prime which is kind of like
[00:06:25] the first half before you do the F prime
[00:06:27] and I kind of get in that groove so at
[00:06:29] first you know I'm gonna do it very
[00:06:30] slowly but you notice that I can kind of
[00:06:32] slide into stuff right I can kind of get
[00:06:37] this kind of groove and you go learn now
[00:06:39] on your own and that will help you
[00:06:41] memorize it so break it up into small
[00:06:43] sections get the R u prime R prime R u
[00:06:46] prime R prime are you from R prime or
[00:06:48] are you prime R front and so on until
[00:06:50] you get that and so basically that whole
[00:06:52] first section up until the F prime is
[00:06:54] kind of like the first half you can get
[00:06:56] that feeling good then the second half
[00:07:02] is kind of a similar version of the
[00:07:04] first half then you have that F and then
[00:07:06] a final R so it's just a matter of
[00:07:08] practicing in small bits repeating it
[00:07:10] over and over and then what I like to do
[00:07:11] is I get a timer and I just try to do
[00:07:13] that repetition oh I'm not even looking
[00:07:15] at the stickers I just tried to do it as
[00:07:17] fast as I can okay three point five
[00:07:22] that's not that fast but I have a good
[00:07:25] feeling I could do under the table I can
[00:07:27] do with my eyes closed and then I have
[00:07:30] so what are you actually doing as I said
[00:07:33] before you're basically using that y
[00:07:36] perm to swap pieces there's basically a
[00:07:38] what they call a buffer zone and a swap
[00:07:42] zone we can call it the buffer zone is
[00:07:44] gonna be that top sticker it's kind of
[00:07:46] like a protected zone you never want to
[00:07:48] mess with it because whenever you do
[00:07:49] that algorithm it's just gonna place the
[00:07:51] piece that you had here into that corner
[00:07:54] so then obviously the other one is
[00:07:55] called the swap zone that's the one that
[00:07:57] you bring to this little corner pointing
[00:08:00] out here so that when you do the
[00:08:02] algorithm you know that it's gonna get
[00:08:04] put into the buffer zone and so you can
[00:08:06] use that fact to kind of move the cue
[00:08:08] pieces around to get to here swap it
[00:08:11] then move it where you want to go and
[00:08:13] then swap it to there and so on to make
[00:08:15] any sense of that you need to have some
[00:08:17] understanding or code to memorize of
[00:08:20] what the pieces are since we're gonna do
[00:08:22] all the top all the back all the front
[00:08:25] all the sides all the bottoms right
[00:08:26] that's four times six sides that's
[00:08:29] twenty-four different stickers I'm just
[00:08:32] gonna use the alphabet the way you can
[00:08:33] do it is the top starting with the
[00:08:35] buffer zone going clockwise is just
[00:08:37] going to be ABCD then the face closest
[00:08:40] to you the green is gonna be clockwise
[00:08:42] again
[00:08:43] e F G H then on the right side so we're
[00:08:47] going down and around with the ijkl then
[00:08:50] the back and n o P clockwise then the
[00:08:53] other side Q R st and then on the bottom
[00:08:56] if you're looking at it clockwise you V
[00:08:59] W and X so this is where the
[00:09:02] understanding of it can get a bit tricky
[00:09:03] and honestly if you really want to
[00:09:06] understand it I'm sure there are other
[00:09:08] tutorials that explain it better you can
[00:09:10] get by with just believing that it works
[00:09:12] telling you it works and it works so
[00:09:13] just do it but if you really want to get
[00:09:15] the idea watch another video but mice
[00:09:17] kind of stupid dumb down explanation is
[00:09:20] when you go to the airport the airport
[00:09:21] is the place that takes you places right
[00:09:24] you get on the plane and it takes you
[00:09:26] somewhere else but you always start at
[00:09:28] home and you end up back at home once
[00:09:30] you come back from your trip you move
[00:09:32] yourself to the airport and then the
[00:09:33] airport takes you somewhere else you do
[00:09:35] your vacation and then you want to
[00:09:37] return back home okay so that's what's
[00:09:39] gonna happen with this cube right so
[00:09:42] when I want
[00:09:43] to swap something I'm gonna move it to
[00:09:46] this swap zone to the airport basically
[00:09:49] so that the sticker I want to move goes
[00:09:51] here then I'm gonna do my little
[00:09:53] algorithm my y perm that's my flight and
[00:09:56] then once I've completed the vacation I
[00:09:59] need to remove that sticker back to its
[00:10:01] home just go home that's your home are
[00:10:05] you
[00:10:05] oh yes the y perm is the only algorithm
[00:10:09] you to know there is always gonna be a
[00:10:11] quote-unquote set up move and they're so
[00:10:13] simple
[00:10:14] there are sheets that have them so you
[00:10:16] can just memorize them but honestly I
[00:10:17] think it's a waste of memorization if
[00:10:19] you understand the cube you can always
[00:10:20] spatially figure out how to get the
[00:10:23] piece you want to this swap zone to the
[00:10:25] airport just so you know right the
[00:10:27] buffer zone is a and the swap zone is
[00:10:30] the L sticker so let's say that I want
[00:10:33] to swap the I sticker which is this one
[00:10:36] right if you're looking at the cube it's
[00:10:38] this one and this is L so what would be
[00:10:41] my set up move right I basically have to
[00:10:43] get this sticker that's pointing out
[00:10:44] here to be here well that's easy right
[00:10:47] it's just one of these right there it is
[00:10:50] it's now in the swap zone I can then do
[00:10:53] that y perm algorithm that you know to
[00:10:55] get this sticker up here but when I do
[00:10:58] that when I swap them I gotta remember
[00:11:00] to do the reverse you got to come back
[00:11:01] home so when I'm done doing the Y perm I
[00:11:04] got to move it back to I so now this
[00:11:07] sticker is back where it belongs let's
[00:11:09] say I'm looking at my cube and I want to
[00:11:12] move e that's this front green one what
[00:11:15] you have to remember is you can't
[00:11:16] disturb this cube the a sticker or the
[00:11:20] buffer zone that can't move so if you
[00:11:22] are doing a move to set it up and you've
[00:11:25] disturbed it that's the wrong thing so
[00:11:27] like if I think oh yeah I want to get it
[00:11:29] down here I'm gonna move no no no don't
[00:11:31] move that because that's you're
[00:11:33] disturbing the buffer zone leave it a
[00:11:34] lot there's always a move or series of
[00:11:37] moves to get your sticker to the swab
[00:11:39] zone without touching a so you can maybe
[00:11:41] turn it down to the bottom and then out
[00:11:44] to here now I know it messes everything
[00:11:47] up but as long as you do the wiper after
[00:11:49] and you remember to go back home
[00:11:52] basically undo this
[00:11:53] move then nothing changes except what
[00:11:56] you swapped the best way to learn is by
[00:11:58] showing you an example I'll just show
[00:12:00] you what you're supposed to do in terms
[00:12:01] of memorization and then you have the
[00:12:03] tools to solve it it's just a matter of
[00:12:05] putting that piece that you want to
[00:12:07] switch into the drop zone and then doing
[00:12:09] the algorithm and putting it back
[00:12:10] however many times you need to do that
[00:12:12] based on the scramble of the cube look I
[00:12:17] know it's a lot of information but it's
[00:12:21] relatively simple trust me it's just a
[00:12:23] lot of things to kind of know to get
[00:12:25] started when you start doing a few of
[00:12:27] them you know you take your time and you
[00:12:29] make sure that you're seeing the cube in
[00:12:31] your head as you turn it and you do the
[00:12:32] y perm algorithm correctly every time
[00:12:35] you'll get that salt cube and then you
[00:12:37] can get faster at it and faster at so
[00:12:42] when you're trying to solve this
[00:12:43] particular scrambled cube you first got
[00:12:46] to decide your orientation so in this
[00:12:47] case most of it is solved so I'm gonna
[00:12:50] go with green and front white on top the
[00:12:52] first thing I do and this is the
[00:12:53] approach you take to any solve you find
[00:12:56] out which as you look in your buffer
[00:13:03] zone and you look at what the sticker is
[00:13:05] that's on the top and you say to
[00:13:07] yourself where does that go and the
[00:13:10] letter of where that should go is the
[00:13:12] thing that you memorize okay that's the
[00:13:14] first step the first letter that you
[00:13:15] memorize so I'm looking at this top
[00:13:17] piece it's a green sticker that doesn't
[00:13:19] mean much because obviously there's four
[00:13:21] possible green stickers on this face so
[00:13:24] I look at the other ones orange and
[00:13:25] yellow so that tells me and I got to
[00:13:27] know where all the colors are right
[00:13:29] orange is on the left side yellow is on
[00:13:31] the bottom so it's probably gonna be
[00:13:33] this green piece right with orange here
[00:13:36] yellow there okay so I need this green
[00:13:39] piece to be here now what letter is this
[00:13:42] that's e F G H so in my mind i memorize
[00:13:46] the letter H okay next thing I want to
[00:13:49] do is I look at the piece that is
[00:13:51] already here so I'm gonna kind of make
[00:13:53] this daisy chain of I started the buffer
[00:13:56] zone and then wherever that takes me
[00:13:57] then I look at that and where does that
[00:13:59] go and then where does that next piece
[00:14:01] go so I create a chain of letters that
[00:14:04] will be the fan memorizing that I use to
[00:14:06] solve it with my eyes closed
[00:14:07] so I have h already and now I look at
[00:14:09] this piece it's a red piece with blue
[00:14:12] and white so I know that red is on the
[00:14:16] other side of green blue is on the back
[00:14:19] and then white is obviously on top so
[00:14:21] that red is here right which is gonna be
[00:14:24] if I'm looking at it this way it's the J
[00:14:26] piece the next question is where does
[00:14:28] this piece go we'll look that's the one
[00:14:29] that's at the top right that's the white
[00:14:31] that's the buffer zone piece I know that
[00:14:33] because it has a little mark on it some
[00:14:35] Rubik's cubes have their logo there and
[00:14:36] that's usually where the buffer piece is
[00:14:38] so it's kind of like home that's the
[00:14:40] last piece if that's the one I land on
[00:14:42] then there's nowhere for that to go
[00:14:44] because when I swap it it's gonna
[00:14:46] naturally fall back here and it's solved
[00:14:48] that's how you know it's solved when you
[00:14:50] kind of get this resolution so this is a
[00:14:52] really easy solve it's just two letters
[00:14:55] H and J just knowing H J will tell me
[00:14:59] okay I gotta put H in my swap zone do
[00:15:04] the algorithm then put it back right
[00:15:07] remember you find the airport gonna come
[00:15:08] back then take J put it to my swap zone
[00:15:12] do the algorithm and put J back and the
[00:15:15] cube should be solved right so
[00:15:17] essentially you're just doing that y
[00:15:19] perm algorithm twice obviously with some
[00:15:21] setup and return setup moves and that's
[00:15:25] it
[00:15:26] so let's do it so the first thing I want
[00:15:28] to do is make sure that I have the green
[00:15:30] face that I've decided is facing me and
[00:15:32] the white on the top I remember the
[00:15:34] first letter H e f g h i got to do one
[00:15:37] rotation to get it to that swap zone the
[00:15:41] L and then I do my algorithm okay and
[00:15:47] then I put it back so remember I did one
[00:15:49] turn that way I got to do it back the
[00:15:51] other way
[00:15:51] and there you go the green is now solved
[00:15:54] in the front but we have one more piece
[00:15:56] next one is J right which I know is up
[00:15:58] here and I'm gonna put that in the swap
[00:16:01] zone which is L and that's it easy just
[00:16:02] two rotations like that on the our side
[00:16:05] and then I do my algorithm to close my
[00:16:09] eyes so I can practice that feel and
[00:16:11] then I put it back right which is just
[00:16:13] two rotations on the are set and back
[00:16:16] the other way and there we have it
[00:16:19] let's do another example a little harder
[00:16:21] and so that you can follow on I want you
[00:16:24] to take your cube that's solved okay
[00:16:27] make sure that the green is facing you
[00:16:29] and the white is on top and I want you
[00:16:31] to do the following algorithm so that we
[00:16:32] can end up the same messed up state so
[00:16:35] we're looking at the same cube we can
[00:16:36] memorize the same one all right so it's
[00:16:38] basically an are you prime F L d squared
[00:16:45] R prime L so I'm gonna start figuring
[00:16:49] out what I have to memorize so I look I
[00:16:51] start by looking at the sticker that's
[00:16:53] in the buffer zone right and it's an
[00:16:55] orange
[00:16:55] okay so orange I know goes on the left
[00:16:58] side let me look at the other stickers
[00:16:59] green and white I know there's gonna be
[00:17:01] this front corner right but specifically
[00:17:03] this orange piece that's sticking out
[00:17:05] here which if I remember is are over
[00:17:07] this side is qrst so that's R so that's
[00:17:10] the first thing I memorize are all right
[00:17:12] then I look at this piece that's in the
[00:17:15] our position of where does that go it's
[00:17:16] also an orange piece but obviously it's
[00:17:18] a different corner because of the blue
[00:17:20] and the yellow and that actually is
[00:17:21] gonna be T okay that's the one that has
[00:17:23] to go down here so I have RT that piece
[00:17:26] red blue and white needs to go to J
[00:17:30] that's over here I want you to practice
[00:17:32] this I'm gonna go through it pretty
[00:17:33] quickly but basically then you're gonna
[00:17:35] need to put it at you then F then G then
[00:17:39] K and then P my expertise obviously is
[00:17:42] not cubing my expertise is memorization
[00:17:44] so how are you gonna memorize eight
[00:17:46] letters like that it's just like in any
[00:17:48] of my other videos you basically want to
[00:17:49] turn this jumble of letters the
[00:17:51] meaningless things you have to memorize
[00:17:53] into something that you can picture so
[00:17:55] the easiest thing to picture are words
[00:17:57] and since we have letters we can create
[00:17:59] words I like to pair letters together so
[00:18:01] that they're manageable short chunks so
[00:18:03] if we have eight letters and we have
[00:18:05] four little letter pairs that we got to
[00:18:07] create a word for now there's different
[00:18:08] ways to approach this maybe the actual
[00:18:11] two letters is a word or it sounds like
[00:18:14] some abbreviated word that you know you
[00:18:16] can think of an anachronism uh FERS own
[00:18:22] the Leonard a is actually never used you
[00:18:26] never have to memorize it just because
[00:18:27] that's the last piece that gets put back
[00:18:29] in place automatically
[00:18:30] the other moves that you do so you could
[00:18:33] insert it a between the two letters as a
[00:18:35] fail-safe if you can't really come up
[00:18:37] with anything so if we have our T you
[00:18:40] can put the a between and there you go
[00:18:42] you have a rat okay the next one Ju if I
[00:18:44] say it jus it reminds me of someone
[00:18:47] who's Jewish
[00:18:47] I might picture a rabbi all right so I
[00:18:49] have a rat and a rabbi the next two
[00:18:51] pears I have FG I instantly think a
[00:18:54] Family Guy
[00:18:54] and when I think a Family Guy I think of
[00:18:56] Peter Griffin okay so Family Guy Peter
[00:18:58] Griffin last one is KP if I put the a
[00:19:00] between I get the word cap I can picture
[00:19:02] a cap obviously I have to take special
[00:19:04] caution to remember that it's okay not a
[00:19:07] C right C is actually one of our
[00:19:10] stickers so that's okay I'll just make
[00:19:12] that extra note that it's a cap with a
[00:19:14] big K on it now I have four distinct
[00:19:17] images there what I do in all my other
[00:19:19] things is just link them together into a
[00:19:21] silly little story and this is quick to
[00:19:22] do if you're just not time that you're
[00:19:24] memorizing the cube before you close
[00:19:26] your eyes and solve it you'll just say
[00:19:28] okay there's a rat and he attacks a
[00:19:30] rabbi or whatever and suddenly Peter
[00:19:34] Griffin comes in wearing a big cap on
[00:19:37] his head that says the letter K that's
[00:19:40] it and so you have Artie rap Jew Ju
[00:19:43] Family Guy F G and cap with the K KP a
[00:19:48] bat should solve your cute should we try
[00:19:51] it okay just watch me I'll help you with
[00:19:54] the first few and then we'll kind of go
[00:19:56] through it a bit quicker so R is the
[00:19:58] first one how do I get that piece to the
[00:20:00] L so remember I can disturb this sticker
[00:20:03] so everything I gotta move has to be
[00:20:04] kind of around it I can't move anything
[00:20:06] that touches all right so R is here
[00:20:08] that's okay I can move F kind of just do
[00:20:11] a three quarter turn there it is I do my
[00:20:13] algorithm and then I put it back right
[00:20:18] so I undo that three quarter turn in the
[00:20:20] front and now it's in its place cool how
[00:20:22] was our next letter
[00:20:23] oh yeah R at T right so where is it q r
[00:20:26] s t it's this one right how do I bring
[00:20:29] that to L well it's easy I can just do a
[00:20:32] bottom 3/4 turn and then it's there I
[00:20:35] use an algorithm
[00:20:36] again okay now I put it back I do undo
[00:20:41] that turn and there it is we have the
[00:20:43] two orange pieces now in place sweet
[00:20:45] what's the next one we have rat and
[00:20:47] that's done now we have J right so I J
[00:20:50] that's this corner one here we do that
[00:20:52] before the previous example just a
[00:20:54] couple of rotations there we do the
[00:20:56] algorithm and I put it back and there it
[00:21:00] is the red is there cool all right next
[00:21:02] one is you that's on the bottom okay
[00:21:04] this is seemingly difficult how do I get
[00:21:06] this underneath piece to here actually
[00:21:08] look if you just do that here it is
[00:21:11] si knowing how this spatially works when
[00:21:14] you really understand it it's not that
[00:21:15] difficult
[00:21:16] thank you the algorithm and then I make
[00:21:20] sure to put it back and there it is okay
[00:21:23] look it's kind of looking good all right
[00:21:25] all right
[00:21:25] F so EF f is in the front what could I
[00:21:28] do here right so this would be a combo
[00:21:30] put it on the bottom and then rotate it
[00:21:32] in do the algorithm okay rotate it back
[00:21:38] and there it is nice okay G now that's a
[00:21:43] tough one because it is that corner
[00:21:45] piece where L is so I'm gonna have to
[00:21:47] kind of like move out of the way and
[00:21:48] then move it back in so you can move it
[00:21:50] to the right and then rotate it there
[00:21:52] you go
[00:21:55] okay and I got to remember how I did
[00:21:58] that so I think I wrote to the bareness
[00:22:01] yeah okay look at that we're almost
[00:22:03] there now we have KP ijk that's this one
[00:22:06] that's just a one rotation like that do
[00:22:10] the algorithm cool and I rotate it back
[00:22:14] okay so now P last one that's just one
[00:22:17] rotation like that and there it is wow
[00:22:25] wow wow
[00:22:28] one last tip for you guys there are
[00:22:31] other cases that can be a little more
[00:22:32] complicated I'm not going to go over
[00:22:34] that right now in this video I could be
[00:22:36] here all day talking about it but I've
[00:22:38] given you the basics I've gone over a
[00:22:40] couple simple situations most of which
[00:22:42] you will encounter and others you can
[00:22:45] probably figure out but if you really
[00:22:46] need help there are plenty of other
[00:22:47] videos I'll link them in a description
[00:22:49] if you want some really in-depth videos
[00:22:51] to help you with all the cases and yeah
[00:22:54] Wow dude that's pretty sick alright guys
[00:22:57] thanks for watching I hope that was
[00:22:58] somewhat helpful this is probably one of
[00:23:00] my longer videos just cuz it is
[00:23:01] something I have to show you and go
[00:23:04] through there's a lot to it even though
[00:23:06] it's kind of simple once you kind of get
[00:23:08] the hang of it but people have asked me
[00:23:09] to do a blindfolded cube solving video
[00:23:12] and so here it is and then so maybe down
[00:23:15] the line we could do it 3x3 anyways
[00:23:17] thanks guys hope you enjoyed the video
[00:23:19] I'll see you in the next one please like

=== **PART DEUX** HOW TO MEMORIZE ALL THE WORLD CUP WINNERS (ADDING FRANCE '18) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU_Xm2bcazU

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:10] what's up guys I'm an idiot I should
[00:00:13] have probably made my World Cup winners
[00:00:16] video after the World Cup cuz there was
[00:00:17] gonna be a new champ but I did it before
[00:00:19] but well I guess I guess it was nice to
[00:00:23] do before cuz then you had him in your
[00:00:25] head
[00:00:25] you could've shown off to your friends
[00:00:26] during the World Cup whatever there's a
[00:00:29] new World Cup champ France well they've
[00:00:31] already won but this is their second
[00:00:32] time winning and check out this retro
[00:00:35] Jersey from 98 I don't you know I don't
[00:00:38] think I own any other piece of clothing
[00:00:40] that is 20 years old that is in a such
[00:00:44] good condition that too still fits me
[00:00:46] and I guess three that I still wear even
[00:00:50] before they have the star there right
[00:00:51] now they have two stars alright so what
[00:00:55] do you do when you have information that
[00:00:56] you've memorized and you need to update
[00:00:58] it either change something or make an
[00:01:00] amendment in this case we're adding
[00:01:02] something new right so if you remember
[00:01:04] from my previous video and if you
[00:01:06] haven't seen it yet go watch that video
[00:01:08] before you continue watching it's a
[00:01:10] video on how to memorize all the World
[00:01:11] Cup winners in all of history France had
[00:01:13] only won once in 1998 and what we did is
[00:01:16] we took the number 98 translating the
[00:01:19] numbers into letters consonants and
[00:01:22] creating a word and we visualized the
[00:01:23] words so 98 turned into a B and an F I
[00:01:26] created the word beef and our picture
[00:01:28] was imagining ourselves eating beef with
[00:01:31] fries steak frite under the Eiffel Tower
[00:01:33] so associating it to something French so
[00:01:36] we remember that beef has to do with
[00:01:37] France beef means 98 France won in 1998
[00:01:40] the new year is 18 2018 so we gotta come
[00:01:44] up with a picture for the number
[00:01:45] eighteen one eight using that same major
[00:01:48] system those two consonant sounds for
[00:01:50] the one in the 8 RT and a B
[00:01:53] quick little thing we got to do is just
[00:01:55] create a picture and insert it into the
[00:01:57] image that we already had for beef and
[00:01:59] France and all what's up and that's the
[00:02:01] beauty of memory techniques right you
[00:02:03] can just link things into your story as
[00:02:06] you need to add them because France won
[00:02:07] another time that's fine let me just add
[00:02:09] the picture France wins again I'll just
[00:02:11] add a picture to that TV right so I'll
[00:02:14] think of my image which was eating steak
[00:02:18] frite beef and frites under the Eiffel
[00:02:20] Tower traditional French accordion music
[00:02:22] playing you got a baguette under your
[00:02:24] arm it's just typical France beautiful
[00:02:26] I'm gonna imagine that while I'm eating
[00:02:28] dinner I'm say I'm on a romantic date
[00:02:29] with my wife or my significant other or
[00:02:32] whatever I'm watching TV maybe I'm
[00:02:34] watching the French win the World Cup
[00:02:36] under the Eiffel Tower on TV and that's
[00:02:39] it so you think of eating beef steak
[00:02:40] frite and watching TV under the Eiffel
[00:02:43] Tower you're welcome
[00:02:44] short video just a quick amendment to
[00:02:46] what I had done a couple videos ago now
[00:02:48] that video series is complete I'll have
[00:02:50] to talk about for another four years and
[00:02:52] we can move on to other stuff I'll see
[00:02:54] you in the next video please subscribe
[00:02:56] like share all that stuff I'll see you
[00:02:57] later

=== I LOST AGAIN! (2018 USA Memory Championship RECAP) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qxx-cnneFXE

[00:00:00] yeah okay I lost again for the second
[00:00:02] time actually this is my fourth time
[00:00:06] losing fourth time music believe it or
[00:00:08] not
[00:00:08] what did I lose I lost the us memory
[00:00:12] championship so how did I lose a lot of
[00:00:17] people are asking me the question and
[00:00:19] well it comes down to me forgetting I
[00:00:24] forgot something
[00:00:25] and then I lost
[00:00:27] [Music]
[00:00:32] you know when it comes down to it I
[00:00:34] trained a lot but uh the cards didn't
[00:00:37] fall my way
[00:00:38] you know you trained so hard so that you
[00:00:40] know or have a high likelihood of
[00:00:43] knowing what's gonna happen and that was
[00:00:45] the case for me except I didn't know
[00:00:47] that what's gonna happen for those of
[00:00:48] you that don't know how this memory
[00:00:50] championship works it's typically
[00:00:52] one-day event where the morning you
[00:00:54] memorize stuff a paper names cards
[00:00:57] poetry and numbers and the top eight
[00:01:00] will advance to the afternoon round
[00:01:01] where it's three separate rounds of kind
[00:01:04] of elimination-style random words and
[00:01:06] memorize words and you say I'm on stage
[00:01:08] Tea Party event where random strangers
[00:01:10] come onstage and say stuff about them
[00:01:12] like how old they are who they are where
[00:01:14] they're from favorite stuff favorite
[00:01:16] food and then finally the last one is
[00:01:18] two decks of cards you're gonna memorize
[00:01:20] it and say it with no mistakes the last
[00:01:22] person standing wins this year we had a
[00:01:24] different way of doing it the qualifiers
[00:01:27] the morning part was done Mac in March I
[00:01:29] placed first I did pretty well
[00:01:31] I hit my scores great they let 13 they
[00:01:34] actually that 14 people qualify one
[00:01:36] person didn't show up and so on this day
[00:01:39] this was past weekend we had the finals
[00:01:41] which was gonna be four rounds of
[00:01:43] eliminations about 13 people whittling
[00:01:46] it down to one so the events were
[00:01:48] essentially the same just a few
[00:01:50] adjustments the first round was still
[00:01:51] gonna be words except instead of getting
[00:01:53] something wrong and being eliminated you
[00:01:55] get two strikes you can afford to make
[00:01:57] one mistake the second one is the Tea
[00:01:59] Party again less people four people this
[00:02:01] time instead of six which it typically
[00:02:03] is but more information per person
[00:02:06] doable great then a new event was going
[00:02:09] to be a long-term event where we had to
[00:02:10] memorize tons of information beforehand
[00:02:13] and they were gonna quiz us on it
[00:02:14] specifically it was the Rock and Roll
[00:02:16] Hall of Fame NFL Hall of Fame Academy
[00:02:19] Awards and periodic tables and then the
[00:02:23] final was gonna be the same thing two
[00:02:25] decks of cards memorized actually the
[00:02:28] small difference was the girly shuffle
[00:02:29] together and
[00:02:30] sort of two separate decks which isn't a
[00:02:32] big difference typically my strength is
[00:02:35] the words I'm great with words I held
[00:02:38] the record for the US for a long time
[00:02:40] and usually what happens is so you have
[00:02:42] 13 people going for as many words as
[00:02:45] they can do comfortably by saying it
[00:02:48] without making a mistake on stage with
[00:02:50] nerves and all that stuff so somewhere
[00:02:52] in my head I guess I thought that having
[00:02:54] an extra strike would cause people to go
[00:02:56] further but you know what in the end it
[00:02:58] actually didn't really go to that high
[00:03:00] of a number of words because what
[00:03:02] happens is there's 13 people for 13
[00:03:04] people and three people will be
[00:03:06] eliminated so you got to know that the
[00:03:08] bottom three people the least three
[00:03:11] capable people are typically the ones
[00:03:14] who will get out right how far can those
[00:03:16] least capable people memorize words for
[00:03:18] and then you get 15 minutes memorize
[00:03:21] there's 300 words total so you think
[00:03:23] okay maybe a hundred right probably even
[00:03:27] less for whatever reason I went I don't
[00:03:30] know why I don't know why I went for 240
[00:03:33] which no need no need whatsoever
[00:03:38] yeah and so to say 240 words at a high
[00:03:42] pace no mistakes on stage I remember
[00:03:47] walking out to the stage and just
[00:03:48] everything was like out of my control
[00:03:50] and I was like woah woah woah hold on
[00:03:52] before I knew that I had the microphone
[00:03:54] in my hand I said the first word right
[00:03:55] next one I have to pass on the next one
[00:03:57] I flipped so I was out two strikes just
[00:04:00] like that so embarrassing really
[00:04:03] embarrassing you know I hold myself at a
[00:04:06] higher standard than that but listen
[00:04:09] this is memory sports and the whole
[00:04:11] point of winning memory championships is
[00:04:12] not forgetting and I forgot so what am I
[00:04:14] going to do the other thing is
[00:04:17] I don't know I just fell off that day
[00:04:20] anyways congratulations to the new us
[00:04:23] memory champion John Graham he did
[00:04:26] awesome he made it through all the way
[00:04:27] to the end and from what I heard from
[00:04:29] what I saw the final card he was with
[00:04:32] precision hitting those cards perfectly
[00:04:34] which is awesome not many people can do
[00:04:36] that and so in this video you know I
[00:04:39] also wanted to explain what went wrong
[00:04:41] but at the same time I thought it'd be
[00:04:42] fun if we looked at my blog post from
[00:04:46] 2013 when I lost last because what I
[00:04:50] realize is I'm devastated right I lost
[00:04:52] this championship I wanted a fifth title
[00:04:54] but you know sometimes losing right is a
[00:04:58] smack in the face and it's exactly what
[00:05:01] you need to get back on the horse
[00:05:03] right and so back in 2013 I had just won
[00:05:06] twice in a row 2011 2012 and I think
[00:05:10] even 2012 I was dominant and I don't
[00:05:14] mean to brag but I literally want all
[00:05:17] the events and I didn't make any
[00:05:18] mistakes anywhere and I want so I think
[00:05:22] I came in the next year probably feeling
[00:05:25] like I didn't need to prepare as much I
[00:05:27] don't know although I did but you know
[00:05:29] you have that kind of nugget in your
[00:05:30] head that drives you and it wasn't there
[00:05:33] so maybe that was the case this year the
[00:05:36] point being is I came back from 2013 I
[00:05:38] won it twice in a row so winning is
[00:05:41] great
[00:05:42] losing is also great it hurts but it's
[00:05:45] great it's probably even better than
[00:05:47] winning to be honest if you want to win
[00:05:49] more so not saying I'm gonna win no I'm
[00:05:52] saying I'm gonna win I'm gonna win again
[00:05:54] anyways let's take a look because some
[00:05:56] of this is funny it would be nice to
[00:05:58] jump into my head that was five years
[00:06:01] ago
[00:06:01] so my 29 year old self and yeah how I
[00:06:05] convinced myself that I was okay losing
[00:06:07] this competition alright so let's go to
[00:06:11] my blog alright so let's go to Google
[00:06:17] google.com great Nelson Dellis
[00:06:24] why who's with him who's looking at my
[00:06:27] wife
[00:06:27] anyways Nelson Dellis log there we go
[00:06:32] now I guess this was March 2013 and I
[00:06:35] haven't look at this I have a lose I
[00:06:37] just remember I did a blog post and I'm
[00:06:40] a really bright blog post anywhere does
[00:06:41] make video so I figured it would be cool
[00:06:43] to kind of see that Alright March 2013
[00:06:46] all right here we go not winning is a
[00:06:49] good thing which is a great title that's
[00:06:52] exactly what I just said but it's also
[00:06:55] obviously justification
[00:06:58] it's okay winning is great not winning
[00:07:02] is great - so what happened in 2013
[00:07:04] before I get into this is there was a
[00:07:05] Science Channel thing filming I think
[00:07:07] that year I was hoping to win my third
[00:07:09] and a lot of friends and family come
[00:07:12] watch and I made it to the finals it was
[00:07:16] me
[00:07:16] I think Ram Coley I don't remember who
[00:07:19] the third one was and rank will he have
[00:07:20] won back in 2005 I think and he competes
[00:07:24] from time to time it just really trained
[00:07:26] he's just good so he showed up and he
[00:07:29] actually squeaked into the finals he was
[00:07:31] just doing the bare minimum and he got
[00:07:33] there and then I I flubbed it anyways
[00:07:37] let's read it let's skip to the double
[00:07:39] deck the final this is where I mess up
[00:07:41] and this is the point that we're trying
[00:07:43] to pull from right I practices so much
[00:07:46] practice I even got in my tunic time
[00:07:49] down to two minutes 30 seconds oh wow
[00:07:51] I didn't know I had been getting it good
[00:07:53] like that that's what I was doing these
[00:07:55] years I wasn't even training five
[00:07:57] minutes I was trying to just do it under
[00:07:59] three minutes every time I get between
[00:08:01] 2:30 and 3 minutes
[00:08:03] typically in competition it takes me
[00:08:05] about 45 seconds to go through each deck
[00:08:07] the first time about saying yeah and
[00:08:09] then I spend the rest of the time
[00:08:11] reviewing the decks as many times as
[00:08:13] possible so the five minutes ended up
[00:08:14] ended and as we started to walk onstage
[00:08:17] I'm was mentally rehearsing both decks I
[00:08:19] knew them down cold nice
[00:08:21] as we started reciting the deck on stage
[00:08:23] out loud I remember being so careful and
[00:08:26] focused on saying each card correctly
[00:08:27] it's easy to say the wrong card even if
[00:08:29] you think you got the right one
[00:08:31] yeah so they say michael glass these are
[00:08:33] the third-place guy got eliminated
[00:08:35] somewhere in the first deck so I say Oh
[00:08:37] while this is happening showing the
[00:08:38] cards were reciting the cards Tony Dean
[00:08:40] of the MC is telling us to slow down and
[00:08:42] is having trouble showing the audience a
[00:08:44] card saying it's because we're going so
[00:08:45] fast I remember the crowd crowd kind of
[00:08:48] muttering at this point and me looking
[00:08:49] over at Tony briefly I think at that
[00:08:51] moment is when my focus shifted and I
[00:08:53] temporary lifted myself out of the
[00:08:55] memory palace I was in for the cards
[00:08:56] when I went back in I started speaking
[00:08:58] before I knew I was there two of spades
[00:09:01] I said which was the correct answer
[00:09:02] three cards before instantly as I said
[00:09:05] it I knew what I was saying was wrong it
[00:09:08] was ace of spades uh and that was it I
[00:09:13] lost just like that off of a stupid
[00:09:15] mistake felt like 2010 all over again
[00:09:18] such is life all right this is probably
[00:09:21] the most interesting part this is how
[00:09:23] I'm justifying it all I had my twenty
[00:09:25] nine year old self so there you have it
[00:09:27] my two year dominance of God stunted by
[00:09:30] a dumb mistake
[00:09:31] it was a dumb mistake congrats to ram
[00:09:33] for sneaking into the top eight and
[00:09:35] having the persistence to stick it out
[00:09:36] to the end true did a great job that
[00:09:39] might have been my last you have same
[00:09:41] memory competition meanwhile 14 15 and
[00:09:46] this year I'm still here here we go
[00:09:49] losing sucks
[00:09:50] for sure good insight bro
[00:09:55] and it hurts especially when you know
[00:09:57] you could have won for a third straight
[00:09:59] time that's true I knew I could have won
[00:10:01] I had the two decks down and I just
[00:10:04] momentary lapse of focus and said the
[00:10:08] wrong card but again this is part of the
[00:10:10] competition right but I have to look at
[00:10:11] the positive and that is that losing is
[00:10:14] usually better than winning okay at
[00:10:16] least in terms of where it takes you
[00:10:18] next I like that yeah that's true
[00:10:20] cuz winning yeah where will it take you
[00:10:24] you're kind of at the top and then can't
[00:10:26] really go much higher but you lose it
[00:10:29] can take you places doesn't necessarily
[00:10:31] have to be at the top again and the
[00:10:33] sport you're losing it but you have to
[00:10:36] figure out where you're gonna go next
[00:10:37] what you're gonna do what you do with
[00:10:39] this shitty feeling when I lost in 2010
[00:10:42] pushed me and motivated me like crazy to
[00:10:44] win in 2011 I did but after winning for
[00:10:48] two straight years right 2011-12 it was
[00:10:52] a lot harder to push myself this time
[00:10:53] around so with this loss I know I'll
[00:10:56] have to push myself in another direction
[00:10:57] and for that I am happy I needed that
[00:11:00] boost so whatever it is that I pushed
[00:11:02] myself towards next watch out but for
[00:11:05] now onto Everest and watch out people
[00:11:07] did because I came back and won 2014 and
[00:11:12] 15 that's pretty cool so I guess the the
[00:11:16] moral of the story here is I shouldn't
[00:11:19] feel so bad that I lost but there's a
[00:11:21] bunch of stuff that I just regret right
[00:11:23] I kind of wanted to hang up my mnemonic
[00:11:26] cleats and just say five-time champ
[00:11:29] would have been nice you know and my
[00:11:31] friend said this is like there's a
[00:11:34] reason why they don't just mail you the
[00:11:36] trophy every year right you got to go
[00:11:40] there and get to the end and I didn't so
[00:11:44] yeah what's next
[00:11:46] well I'm figuring that out I have a
[00:11:48] bunch of projects going on that I got to
[00:11:50] take care of and it's nice that it's all
[00:11:52] over I can just focus on after a little
[00:11:55] bit but I don't think I'm done yeah I'm
[00:11:58] not done this is a weird video no real
[00:12:02] tips here just some insight into how I
[00:12:04] thought back then and how I think now
[00:12:07] thanks for watching if you enjoyed this
[00:12:09] please like share subscribe and I'll
[00:12:12] check you out in the next video I got a
[00:12:14] bunch lined up that I should be
[00:12:16] releasing in the next few weeks

[00:00:28] it's the 2018 World Cup every four years
[00:00:32] I go psycho I was born in England so I
[00:00:35] support England the three lions parents
[00:00:37] of French Belgian so I also back them up
[00:00:39] but England is the team for me and every
[00:00:41] time the World Cup comes around I like
[00:00:43] to show off my memory skills with
[00:00:45] knowledge about the World Cup that I
[00:00:47] just have memorized over the years for
[00:00:49] example who was the very first World Cup
[00:00:52] winner Uruguay in 1930 against Argentina
[00:00:55] 42 which took place in Montevideo
[00:00:57] Uruguay how many times does Italy won
[00:00:59] the World Cup
[00:01:00] actually they won it four times in 1934
[00:01:03] 1938 1982 and 2006 has England ever won
[00:01:07] the World Cup yes they won it in 1966
[00:01:10] against Germany for to West Germany for
[00:01:13] two at Wembley Stadium can you list the
[00:01:15] past five champions in a row Germany
[00:01:17] then before that Spain then before that
[00:01:19] Italy then before that Brazil then
[00:01:21] before that France damn son alright so
[00:01:23] let me show you how to memorize World
[00:01:24] Cup champions now I was thinking about
[00:01:26] this a lot I was wondering what would be
[00:01:28] the best thing to show you when a video
[00:01:29] is it knowing all the champions in order
[00:01:32] is it maybe knowing which countries have
[00:01:34] won how many times but I think the
[00:01:36] coolest one would be if somebody could
[00:01:38] say the year of a World Cup and you
[00:01:40] would instantly come back with a
[00:01:41] champion winner so technically you know
[00:01:43] all the countries who have won and what
[00:01:45] years they won so if I said Brazil you
[00:01:48] could say ok they won five times and the
[00:01:50] five years that they actually won the
[00:01:52] championship I said did Netherlands ever
[00:01:54] win you would be like no because you
[00:01:56] know all the championship winners and
[00:01:57] Netherlands have never won they've been
[00:01:59] to the finals though to be able to do
[00:02:00] this since there are numbers involved
[00:02:03] you need to be somewhat familiar with a
[00:02:04] number system there's a video that I've
[00:02:06] done in the past teaching what's called
[00:02:08] the major system that's the quickest
[00:02:09] easiest way to learn how to memorize
[00:02:11] numbers I'll link it in the description
[00:02:12] now if you watched it but maybe you
[00:02:15] don't remember what the major system was
[00:02:16] I'm gonna put it up here in the corner
[00:02:18] as a reference for the rest of this
[00:02:20] video so that you know how to convert
[00:02:22] numbers into letters and that's little
[00:02:24] point we can burn numbers into letters
[00:02:25] and those letters make words so we pick
[00:02:28] the work so what we're gonna do is
[00:02:29] basically take an image to represent the
[00:02:31] country and that will be easy because we
[00:02:32] just think of the first thing that comes
[00:02:34] to mind when we think of that country
[00:02:35] stereotype it can be food it can be
[00:02:38] something cultural whatever comes to
[00:02:40] mind we'll come up with it together and
[00:02:41] then we're gonna associate that image
[00:02:43] with images for the year or the multiple
[00:02:47] years that they've won translated into
[00:02:49] words either major systems smash those
[00:02:51] together that's pretty much it
[00:02:53] first things first there's a couple
[00:02:55] World Cup things you need to know before
[00:02:57] we start memorizing one is that there's
[00:02:59] only been 20 World Cups since 1930 which
[00:03:03] is when it started there was a bit of a
[00:03:04] gap between 1938 and the next one which
[00:03:08] was 1950 for obvious reasons but there's
[00:03:11] only been 20 overall cool second thing
[00:03:13] you need to know and this makes it even
[00:03:14] easier to memorize this is that there's
[00:03:16] only been 8 different countries that
[00:03:18] have won the World Cup over these 20
[00:03:19] Championships will memorize them
[00:03:21] properly but it's Spain England France
[00:03:24] Brazil Italy Germany Argentina and
[00:03:27] Uruguay some of those were West Germany
[00:03:29] at the time but let's just consider that
[00:03:31] in Germany so what's gonna happen is I'm
[00:03:33] going to save the country where we'll
[00:03:34] start with the country that's one the
[00:03:36] least and go up to the one that's one
[00:03:37] the most I'll help you come up with a
[00:03:39] picture for the country and then however
[00:03:41] many championship years they've had
[00:03:42] we'll come up with a word to represent
[00:03:45] the two-digit year so we have a
[00:03:46] two-digit number and some of these
[00:03:47] countries have multiple two-digit
[00:03:49] numbers right because they've won many
[00:03:50] times we'll just come up with a picture
[00:03:52] for that and then we'll associate the
[00:03:53] two together it's pretty easy you're
[00:03:55] just gonna make a really weird crazy
[00:03:56] story and you'll have it stuff all right
[00:04:00] the first one is Spain and they've only
[00:04:03] won at once they wanted in 2010 which is
[00:04:05] in South Africa all I care about is the
[00:04:07] number 10 you just got to recognize 10
[00:04:09] and associated with Spain the image for
[00:04:11] the number 10 1-0 using our system here
[00:04:14] is going to be hose 1 & 0
[00:04:17] that's a T or D and an S or Z I like to
[00:04:20] think of toes what do I think of for
[00:04:21] Spain for Spain I'm gonna think of a
[00:04:23] bullfighter and his whole getup and he's
[00:04:26] got the cape that's read everything and
[00:04:28] charging him are a series of toes maybe
[00:04:31] they've got horns because they look like
[00:04:32] bulls help you remember
[00:04:34] but there's multiple toes plural right
[00:04:36] just come in one after the other each
[00:04:38] kind of like this menace
[00:04:39] in tow shaped bull okay so we have Spain
[00:04:42] toes Spain ten Spain winner of the 2010
[00:04:47] World Cup next my favorite its England
[00:04:50] of course this was 1966 it was that one
[00:04:53] lone star they've only won one
[00:04:55] championship so we just got that one two
[00:04:57] digit number six six using my system
[00:05:00] again the word that I like to choose
[00:05:01] four six six is judge so my picture for
[00:05:04] England is Big Ben so I'm gonna picture
[00:05:07] a judge with his gavel and his row
[00:05:10] whatever at the top of Big Bend slamming
[00:05:13] down his gavel and making judgment upon
[00:05:16] all those with community so we're in
[00:05:18] England pictured there picture Big Ben
[00:05:20] and that judge sitting on top of the
[00:05:22] tower alright the next one another
[00:05:24] single winner is France
[00:05:26] my dad's French so I have a soft spot
[00:05:28] for these guys out of a blue and they
[00:05:29] won their World Cup in 1998 so all I
[00:05:32] care about is the nine eight ninety
[00:05:34] eight nine eight in my system here
[00:05:36] translates to beef which is pretty
[00:05:39] fitting because when I go to France
[00:05:41] under the Eiffel Tower I usually go to a
[00:05:44] restaurant where I'm eating steak frites
[00:05:46] so that's beef right so to imagine that
[00:05:48] there is a big beef steak frite going on
[00:05:52] and you're sitting under the Eiffel
[00:05:53] Tower it's romantic guy plane for you
[00:05:56] got a baguette under your arm all the
[00:05:58] really cheesy stuff in France reading
[00:06:00] beef under the Eiffel Tower alright the
[00:06:03] next one is going to be a two
[00:06:05] championship winner and the country is
[00:06:07] Uruguay and they want a long time ago
[00:06:10] 1930 the first ever and 1950 so all I
[00:06:14] got to remember is the 30 and the 50
[00:06:16] using my system again 30 could be Mouse
[00:06:19] 50 could be lace so my image for that
[00:06:23] could be like a mouse lacing up his
[00:06:26] shoes right it's got a mouse with lace
[00:06:29] now Uruguay it's a bit tricky it doesn't
[00:06:32] stand out as much with obvious images
[00:06:34] like England France Spain but for
[00:06:36] Uruguay their emblem is the Sun picture
[00:06:39] of the Sun burning this mouse as he's
[00:06:41] tying his lace on the surface of this
[00:06:43] Sun the next one is Argentina they also
[00:06:46] won twice in 1978 and 1986 so we have to
[00:06:50] remember 78 and 86 so the words using my
[00:06:54] system again for 78 could be cave and
[00:06:57] for 86 could be fish Argentina I think
[00:07:01] of the tango I think of this couple
[00:07:03] really dressed beautifully and sexy
[00:07:06] whatever with a rose in the woman's
[00:07:07] mouth the guys dipping her they're doing
[00:07:09] the tango to some really tango esque
[00:07:11] songs cave and fish so let's imagine
[00:07:14] that there
[00:07:15] tange going into a cave and somehow as
[00:07:19] he dips her she actually NAB's some fish
[00:07:22] out of this little pool that's in the
[00:07:24] cave there's a couple doing the tango
[00:07:25] Kate fish the big guns now Italy has won
[00:07:29] four times they won as I said before in
[00:07:32] 1934 1938 1982 and 2006 which is pretty
[00:07:36] recent for those four years right I have
[00:07:39] to have 34 38 82 and zero six so my
[00:07:43] words for those will be mower the lawn
[00:07:45] mower movie fan and sash so forwards a
[00:07:50] little harder but I just got to come up
[00:07:51] with a picture to string them all
[00:07:52] together so imagine you're mowing the
[00:07:54] lawn you got a mower right and your
[00:07:56] friend calls you up to go to the movie
[00:07:57] you're a huge fan of this movie maybe
[00:08:00] it's a real Italian flick about food and
[00:08:04] romance and black and white yeah do you
[00:08:14] have this mower you go to the movie is
[00:08:17] you're a huge fan of Italian movies you
[00:08:19] wear a sash kind of around you cuz
[00:08:21] you're you're like this director want to
[00:08:23] be in your fans
[00:08:24] and you go to this movie mower movie fan
[00:08:27] sash and to tie it to Italy right we can
[00:08:30] have an image for Italy like I said it
[00:08:32] could be an Italian movie think of like
[00:08:34] the language the food the picture that
[00:08:38] all in one and that's the movie you're
[00:08:40] going to see that your huge fan of that
[00:08:42] you wear the sash out after you go
[00:08:43] mowing let's move on to Germany they
[00:08:45] have also won four times and most
[00:08:47] recently in 2014 so the years that they
[00:08:50] won I believe were 1954 1974 1990 and
[00:08:56] 2014 5474 nine zero and one for 14
[00:09:03] Germany makes me think of Tober fest
[00:09:05] that kind of thing for 54 we have lure
[00:09:07] for 74 we have car 90 we have bus 14 we
[00:09:12] have tire lure car bus tire let me
[00:09:15] imagine that I'm lured to an Oktoberfest
[00:09:18] festival I get in my car I get hit by a
[00:09:21] bus tires go flying everywhere
[00:09:23] maybe your tires are made of pretzels
[00:09:25] German the very impresses I'd last
[00:09:28] champion and they've won the most five
[00:09:30] its Brazil right and so Brazil for that
[00:09:33] country I think of carnival people
[00:09:36] dressed up to the nines women with big
[00:09:39] feather contraptions on their head and
[00:09:41] sparkly clothes doing the Samba so the
[00:09:44] five years that day one were 1958 1960
[00:09:47] to 1970 1994 and 2002 okay so we have
[00:09:52] five words there that's kind of
[00:09:53] stretching us to the limit here but we
[00:09:55] can do it so for those five years I'm
[00:09:56] gonna come up with five words lava chain
[00:10:00] gas bear and Sun we somehow got a link
[00:10:03] this all into a story so let's imagine
[00:10:05] that there's lava everywhere right maybe
[00:10:08] it's carnival alright people are
[00:10:09] parading down the streets they're
[00:10:11] dancing samba all dressed up and some
[00:10:13] lava is chasing after them down the
[00:10:15] street what makes it worse is that
[00:10:16] everybody is chained to the ground so
[00:10:19] there's lava chains gasps alright maybe
[00:10:22] as this lava goes down these gas tanks
[00:10:26] explode and God
[00:10:27] getting drowsy and to make matters even
[00:10:30] worse and totally bizarre but memorable
[00:10:32] I want you to picture this giant grizzly
[00:10:35] bear massive also chasing down the
[00:10:37] people and he is holding the Sun in his
[00:10:41] hands as if he's gonna throw it on these
[00:10:43] people what if the Brazilians do oh my
[00:10:44] god
[00:10:45] all right so we have Brazilians doing
[00:10:47] Samba whatever they're trying to escape
[00:10:48] the lava to change the gas the bear and
[00:10:51] the Sun the red hot Sun I know what
[00:10:56] you're thinking Nelson I don't really
[00:10:58] know the major system so if somebody
[00:11:01] says to me who won in 1938 how am I
[00:11:05] gonna know you just taught me how to
[00:11:06] memorize a bunch of words related to a
[00:11:08] country huh yes true you kind of have to
[00:11:11] know this major system I recommend you
[00:11:13] take five minutes to just learn it it's
[00:11:15] not that hard and with a bit of practice
[00:11:17] you'll know it at least with the
[00:11:18] pictures that I gave you it's in your
[00:11:20] head right the hard part is now just to
[00:11:22] translate it so if I say 1938 knowing
[00:11:26] the major system you got to think okay
[00:11:27] three is an m8 is a foot Orvis sound so
[00:11:32] I should know movie right and when I
[00:11:35] think of movie what do I think of I
[00:11:38] think of Italy right because that was
[00:11:40] part of my story right that was with the
[00:11:42] mower the movie the fan the sash and I
[00:11:45] was going to see a Thai movie so if you
[00:11:47] can do that process quick and you can
[00:11:48] already take your time but you don't
[00:11:50] need to ask Google or Alexa you can just
[00:11:52] think for a moment and figure it out
[00:11:54] 1938 38 is movie movie was part of my
[00:11:58] story for Italy Italy won in 1938 my
[00:12:01] friend all right that's it guys I hope
[00:12:03] that was helpful all you have to do is

=== Q & A #1 // RANDOM MEMORY TIPS 18.8 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGyxkGfqjok

[00:00:00] what's up guys another random memory
[00:00:03] tips video except in this video I'm
[00:00:05] really not giving random memory tips I'm
[00:00:07] actually going to be answering some of
[00:00:10] the questions that I receive over the
[00:00:12] past year and a half on YouTube a lot of
[00:00:15] the questions are maybe things I didn't
[00:00:17] get to cover in the video or haven't
[00:00:19] made a video about yet figured why not
[00:00:21] go through some of these questions like
[00:00:23] bang a few out alright nice could you do
[00:00:32] more of these memory tricks and tips
[00:00:35] sure I would love to have a video every
[00:00:38] week for you guys every Monday or every
[00:00:41] Wednesday whatever but it's tough I have
[00:00:44] a lot going on so I try my best
[00:00:46] sometimes i film with the intention of
[00:00:48] getting something out as soon as
[00:00:50] possible but I sit on that video for a
[00:00:52] long time other things creep up but I
[00:00:54] will try to keep it more regular
[00:00:55] especially during the summer my goal
[00:00:57] last year was to do at least one video
[00:00:59] per month which I think I did about 12
[00:01:01] this year I was gonna do two a month I'm
[00:01:03] behind on that but hopefully I can pick
[00:01:04] it up in the summertime sure to avoid
[00:01:07] some vocab and to keep everything inside
[00:01:09] head then we should use tongue to talk
[00:01:12] in mind or what clearly clear this my
[00:01:15] huge doubt thanks I think what the
[00:01:18] person is asking is do i sub vocalize
[00:01:20] when i memorize the answer is yes I say
[00:01:24] what I'm reading in a quiet little voice
[00:01:27] inside my mind I think it's impossible
[00:01:29] to get rid of that voice obviously if
[00:01:31] that voice didn't exists you could maybe
[00:01:34] memorize faster because you wouldn't
[00:01:35] have to take take the time to say the
[00:01:37] words in your mind an approach that
[00:01:39] people have taken to shorten this with
[00:01:41] too quick in this is to have codes that
[00:01:44] are shorter words so for numbers for
[00:01:46] example my sixteen one six is Arnold
[00:01:50] Schwarzenegger I say Arnold
[00:01:51] Schwarzenegger in my mind which is long
[00:01:53] I should probably just say Barney or
[00:01:56] Schwarz or something so and yes I do
[00:01:58] some vocalize I personally am a believer
[00:02:00] that that it's crucial to making a
[00:02:02] memory some people believe that you have
[00:02:04] to get rid of it and you'll be fast
[00:02:05] about that you can memorize that way
[00:02:07] personal opinion okay this is a long
[00:02:09] question but basically it's asking what
[00:02:11] do you think of different explanations
[00:02:12] that have been offered for the origins
[00:02:14] of the major system why these sounds and
[00:02:17] not others good question your guess is
[00:02:19] as good as mine I know that in history
[00:02:21] the history of the major technique of
[00:02:23] the major system that there have been
[00:02:25] other choices for consonants Lewis
[00:02:29] Carroll guy ruined house in Wonderland
[00:02:31] had very different letters there were a
[00:02:34] few iterations of what we now know
[00:02:37] there's a major system but the one that
[00:02:38] is popular now is the one that stuff I
[00:02:40] think in short it doesn't matter as long
[00:02:42] as you choose something that you learn
[00:02:44] and you make real then that should work
[00:02:46] there's no I don't think
[00:02:49] efficiency with these specific number
[00:02:52] letter combinations other than it's just
[00:02:53] popular hey man can you suggest me some
[00:02:56] books that you used sure I can when I
[00:02:58] started I actually started with an audio
[00:03:00] book by Dominic O'Brien quantum memory
[00:03:02] power I don't really like any other
[00:03:04] memory books I mean other than
[00:03:07] moonwalking with Einstein I love when
[00:03:09] walking with Einstein I love the way
[00:03:11] Josh before writes and that book I'm
[00:03:13] obsessed with it's just the classic tome
[00:03:15] for everything that I do with memory
[00:03:19] sports in terms of other stuff no don't
[00:03:23] bother just look online or watch my
[00:03:25] videos how do not have a million subs
[00:03:27] yet these are some super high quality
[00:03:29] vids I know that's what I've been
[00:03:31] wondering why don't I have a million
[00:03:33] subs I'm closing in on 10k though that's
[00:03:38] exciting
[00:03:38] I like your video have a nice day please
[00:03:42] explain Alex Mullins system in a simple
[00:03:45] way
[00:03:48] I'll do that another video please can
[00:03:50] you tell me the name of a book he used
[00:03:52] to train your memory what I said before
[00:03:53] also did but the music is annoying and
[00:03:55] distracting I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not
[00:04:00] the best at necessarily putting all
[00:04:02] these videos together I'm getting better
[00:04:04] I love music and I love putting my
[00:04:07] videos to music so I'm not gonna get rid
[00:04:10] of music ever but I will try to be
[00:04:12] conscious of the choices that make
[00:04:15] sometimes I think a track is awesome and
[00:04:16] I want to use it only to listen to it
[00:04:18] later and realize that yeah that might
[00:04:21] have been not a good track to choose
[00:04:23] only 2000 or so people are watching this
[00:04:26] video yet like 4 billion people are
[00:04:28] watching Vespa Seto
[00:04:29] how sad lol I agree there should be 4
[00:04:33] billion people watching this video right
[00:04:35] now although this besito I've watched
[00:04:38] that video a few times is there any way
[00:04:41] to contact you because I want to talk to
[00:04:43] you on the phone if it's ok it's
[00:04:46] probably not ok no offence love you all
[00:04:49] but yeah you can email me go to my
[00:04:51] website Nelson Dellis calm well that
[00:04:57] leaves me out I don't give a crap about
[00:04:58] athletes or celebrities and can't
[00:05:00] remember enough of my relatives fast
[00:05:01] enough this is a reference to developing
[00:05:04] your Pio system for cards I use the
[00:05:07] example of categorizing the different
[00:05:09] suits one being family and friends
[00:05:11] another being celebrities athletes
[00:05:13] musicians whatever ok so for this kind
[00:05:16] of person you know there's got to be
[00:05:18] something that you are interested in if
[00:05:20] you have no interest in your relatives
[00:05:22] friends celebrities athletes characters
[00:05:26] and books video games anything you
[00:05:28] should have something in your life
[00:05:30] otherwise
[00:05:33] nice work can you make an example with a
[00:05:36] physics textbook I think this is
[00:05:38] reference to memorizing the text or
[00:05:41] passages of text I will do the video on
[00:05:43] this because I think that's a great
[00:05:44] question in short it's basically you
[00:05:47] have two sides of an equation right
[00:05:48] equals sign in the middle it's just
[00:05:50] about coming up with pictures for the
[00:05:52] symbols on the left hand side and
[00:05:53] symbols on the right hand side and
[00:05:55] making them associate to each other I'll
[00:05:58] do some examples in a future video
[00:06:01] pretty idea Nelson what do I do if I
[00:06:03] forgive my memory palace yeah ideally
[00:06:06] you want to choose a memory palace that
[00:06:07] you won't forget so the best memory
[00:06:09] palace are the ones that you know very
[00:06:11] well that you really can't forget but
[00:06:13] there even if you know very well you may
[00:06:15] have a large memory palace with multiple
[00:06:18] anchor points and maybe you forgot one
[00:06:21] or two along the way that happens to me
[00:06:23] actually because I'm these really long
[00:06:24] ones I forget whether I stopped at that
[00:06:26] point or that point so I usually write
[00:06:28] them down when I come up with them I
[00:06:30] just write them down in a book notebook
[00:06:32] or Google Drive I keep all of them and
[00:06:35] that ways are there and I if I ever
[00:06:37] forget I can go on review it it
[00:06:40] shouldn't be too hard to remember right
[00:06:41] it's supposed to be instinctive pass
[00:06:43] through something you know just
[00:06:44] naturally taking out some eminently
[00:06:46] useful do you have any thoughts on
[00:06:48] memorizing games especially chess and go
[00:06:51] cool go I don't know how to play chess
[00:06:54] sure and how to play it I've been
[00:06:56] challenged to memorize a chess board I
[00:06:58] came up with a little strategy for it I
[00:07:00] think anything you can come up with a
[00:07:02] strategy to memorize
[00:07:03] chess board might be a cool video to do
[00:07:05] in the future think about it you just
[00:07:06] have a 8x8 grid a certain number of
[00:07:09] pieces to different colors and come up
[00:07:12] with a system when is the best time to
[00:07:14] review I know that there has been some
[00:07:15] discussion about the amounts of time
[00:07:17] that should pass before reviewing and
[00:07:19] those time points being crucial to long
[00:07:20] time legal Nelson what do you do yeah it
[00:07:22] depends on what I'm memorizing if it's
[00:07:24] in competition and the time is very
[00:07:27] limited I usually do like a 6040
[00:07:30] memorizing review split so 60% of the
[00:07:33] time I'm memorizing 40% of the time
[00:07:36] viewing in terms of stuff that I want to
[00:07:40] actually learn and keep and store my
[00:07:43] brain I'll memorize it typically review
[00:07:47] the crap out of it a bunch that first
[00:07:48] day and then then I just I don't know I
[00:07:51] don't really have a formula for it I
[00:07:52] just kind of do it a lot that first week
[00:07:54] then maybe every once every once in a
[00:07:57] while the next week and taper off slowly
[00:07:59] like that all depends on how well I know
[00:08:01] the information he looks he looks like a
[00:08:05] porn star named Erik Everard
[00:08:07] you're not the first person to tell me
[00:08:08] that mr. Delos
[00:08:10] I have a question regarding the memory
[00:08:11] cause I'm currently have 30 locations
[00:08:14] stored as a hundred digits of pi so does
[00:08:17] that mean I can never use that 30
[00:08:18] location again as long as I want to
[00:08:20] remember PI great question basically can
[00:08:24] you tape over memory palaces if you've
[00:08:27] stored something there that you want to
[00:08:28] keep there forever you can I've done it
[00:08:31] I have places where I keep one specific
[00:08:34] set of information and I've used it to
[00:08:36] memorize something else that was not for
[00:08:38] a long time just for temporary use the
[00:08:40] answer is depends how well you know
[00:08:42] what's already stored there if it's been
[00:08:44] there for years and it's solidified and
[00:08:46] sure probably reusing it for something
[00:08:48] else quickly won't change anything but
[00:08:50] if it's pretty fresh and then you're
[00:08:52] putting something that's something you
[00:08:54] want to keep for a while that's gonna
[00:08:56] get messy so I tend to use things that
[00:08:58] are changing a lot that I need to
[00:09:01] remember for a short period of time and
[00:09:02] it forget I have a memory pass that I
[00:09:04] empty out and put new things in all the
[00:09:07] time when it's usually something I want
[00:09:09] to keep forever I usually keep that
[00:09:11] aside so with your 32 years of PI I
[00:09:13] would keep that separate just to keep it
[00:09:15] special and easier to remember how many
[00:09:18] places do you use in the competition I'm
[00:09:20] very curious about this how many memory
[00:09:22] causes that's I don't want to count them
[00:09:25] but I know in total and must have at
[00:09:27] least 50 to 75 different memory palaces
[00:09:30] for everything and for all of my
[00:09:33] training I don't use that many
[00:09:34] every competition but they're there for
[00:09:36] the use but they very different size and
[00:09:37] some four cards are very short some four
[00:09:40] numbers are super long like 100
[00:09:42] locations long can you tell how to twin
[00:09:46] my memory palace by the only one who
[00:09:50] finds it impossible to think of five
[00:09:52] places with ten locations which I know
[00:09:53] so well that I don't need to memorize
[00:09:55] them I mean if you remember that well
[00:09:57] your childhood home your memory must be
[00:09:59] pretty good already why bother you're
[00:10:00] creating memory palaces sure it's handy
[00:10:02] if you want to memorize the first 10,000
[00:10:04] digits of pi but why the hell would you
[00:10:05] want to do that lots of questions here
[00:10:09] one helmet I want to do that meaning the
[00:10:11] ten thousands of Pi why do you play
[00:10:15] soccer or go to the gym in terms of
[00:10:18] finding it hard to think of five places
[00:10:20] with ten locations
[00:10:21] I don't understand that I can be hard
[00:10:23] just think of your house and choose ten
[00:10:26] pieces of furniture ten things in your
[00:10:28] apartment it doesn't even have to be an
[00:10:29] actual thing it could be a corner of a
[00:10:32] chair a foot of the chair the edge of
[00:10:35] the wall the outlet but if you can't
[00:10:37] then you're not trying hard enough and
[00:10:39] also remembering childhood homes yeah
[00:10:40] sure maybe you don't remember fine a lot
[00:10:44] of mine honestly I didn't really
[00:10:46] remember even correctly I just from what
[00:10:49] I remember I made something up and from
[00:10:51] pictures I've seen I kind of piece it
[00:10:53] together I've been back to memory
[00:10:55] palaces that I created and they were
[00:10:58] completely wrong so it doesn't really
[00:11:00] matter it's what I'm saying excellent
[00:11:03] video a question are you able to
[00:11:05] memorize a whole book if yes how long
[00:11:07] can you keep it in your memory I never
[00:11:08] tried to memorize a whole book I'm
[00:11:09] pretty confident I could it just takes
[00:11:11] time
[00:11:13] commitment there's not a real book that
[00:11:15] I would want to commit to memory
[00:11:16] although I was playing at one point to
[00:11:19] memorize the Hobbit but that would be a
[00:11:20] cool thing Nelson can you be my friend
[00:11:22] yeah why not
[00:11:23] the dog is real dog is very real he's
[00:11:28] actually a French Bulldog his name is
[00:11:29] Henry and he's dozing off over there
[00:11:32] what was your inspiration to become a
[00:11:34] memory champion my inspiration was my
[00:11:37] grandmother she passed away from
[00:11:38] Alzheimer's
[00:11:39] I wanted him for my memory I also wanted
[00:11:43] to be good at something so that together
[00:11:46] that's it
[00:11:47] Nelson why don't you make a video about
[00:11:48] winning at blackjack with memory drinks
[00:11:51] well because you don't need memory
[00:11:53] tricks to win a blackjack do you cube I
[00:11:56] do not very well but I do and I can I
[00:11:59] can also do a blindfolded few more
[00:12:01] questions Billie Jean Paul says we is
[00:12:04] there a cash prize for winning contests
[00:12:05] or mate setting a record I know some of
[00:12:08] these guys make money trying to sell
[00:12:09] their own memory systems based on their
[00:12:10] fame credibility no not really I kind of
[00:12:15] sometimes depends the world
[00:12:17] championships there's been surprised
[00:12:18] money u.s. championship no yeah teach me
[00:12:23] your ways when is your next Everest trip
[00:12:24] good question I was supposed to be
[00:12:26] actually right now but I'm having a baby
[00:12:29] and August so pushing that back
[00:12:31] hopefully 2005 alright last question
[00:12:34] thanks for the video and Elson notice it
[00:12:37] when you in this video you use the
[00:12:39] dominant system in your system you use
[00:12:41] major system for numbers and then use
[00:12:42] nominal systems with PA oh okay he's
[00:12:44] referring to another video I did on the
[00:12:46] major system where I was explaining the
[00:12:49] major system I don't necessarily use it
[00:12:51] I know how to use it and I have used it
[00:12:53] but when I memorize numbers my go-to is
[00:12:55] the Domenic system so I prefer that I
[00:12:58] think PA
[00:12:59] it's the best if you've already come up
[00:13:01] with your zero 0 to 99 your two-digit
[00:13:04] system with major system how do you move
[00:13:06] it over a person action object go
[00:13:07] through your list and for those things
[00:13:09] that are objects just come up with a
[00:13:11] person and action associated with that
[00:13:13] the things that are people or characters
[00:13:15] just come up with an action and object
[00:13:18] thanks for the questions guys there were
[00:13:20] a ton of other questions but I can't get
[00:13:21] to them all maybe I'll do another video
[00:13:23] of these down the road love you guys
[00:13:25] thanks for all the support let's carry
[00:13:27] on and get to that 10,000 subscribers
[00:13:29] that would be amazing
[00:13:30] love you all I'm out

=== INSANE MONEY TRICK! // RANDOM MEMORY TIPS 18.7 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcAHENMvCc8

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:09] what I have here is a five euro bill I'm
[00:00:14] going to show you how to do a pretty
[00:00:15] cool trick with the serial code that is
[00:00:18] on any of these bills
[00:00:20] five to ten to 20 50 100 200 500 if you
[00:00:23] ever traveled to Europe or you are you
[00:00:25] repeat then if you have one of these
[00:00:27] laying around it's a really cool trick
[00:00:28] that you can just do at a bar your
[00:00:30] friends and really impress them so let's
[00:00:32] go
[00:00:36] [Music]
[00:00:44] so the way it works is basically the
[00:00:47] serial number here starts with a letter
[00:00:49] in the case of the five euro though it's
[00:00:51] actually two letters for whatever reason
[00:00:53] doesn't matter it's the same thing all
[00:00:54] the others start with one letter then
[00:00:55] it's followed by a series of numbers now
[00:00:58] what's cool about this serial number is
[00:01:00] that when you add it all together each
[00:01:02] digit it's a number that's divisible by
[00:01:04] nine what that means is that actually
[00:01:07] you can keep adding all these numbers
[00:01:09] and every time you get to a total of
[00:01:12] something that's nine or greater you can
[00:01:14] start back over at zero and then by the
[00:01:16] time you've added everything together
[00:01:18] your answer should equal nine or zero
[00:01:22] however you want to look at it this is
[00:01:24] called casting out nines the way it
[00:01:26] works is say I have four and then I add
[00:01:29] seven my answer would be eleven but the
[00:01:32] way this math works casting out nines is
[00:01:34] every time you pass nine you start back
[00:01:37] over at zero basically you're just
[00:01:38] taking the remainder right so if I'm at
[00:01:41] eleven that's actually really - because
[00:01:43] I reached nine and then nine plus two
[00:01:46] gives me the eleven so I'm never really
[00:01:49] counting past nine and if I do I have to
[00:01:51] wrap around and do the math so that I
[00:01:53] know the exact number past nine that it
[00:01:55] should be okay what you can do is ask
[00:01:57] your friend to read this out and to omit
[00:01:59] one number don't say one of the numbers
[00:02:01] and you'll be able to tell them what the
[00:02:04] missing number is ooh now what do you do
[00:02:06] about the letter this is the memory part
[00:02:08] it's just a little bit of memory and
[00:02:09] that's what I'm here for
[00:02:11] there's something called the ASCII code
[00:02:13] and any capital letter in the alphabet A
[00:02:16] through Z has a decimal number that
[00:02:19] represents it in this ASCII table it's
[00:02:21] used for computer science stuff don't
[00:02:23] worry about it well you gotta remember
[00:02:23] is that capital A or a is 65 and maybe
[00:02:28] also know that Z is 19 you can figure
[00:02:31] out all the other letters by just
[00:02:33] counting in your head a is 65 that means
[00:02:35] that B is 66 67 and so on I know that Z
[00:02:42] is 90 so S is probably let me count
[00:02:45] backwards 83 so with that number 83 I do
[00:02:48] the process I add the digits together 8
[00:02:51] plus 3 which is 11 but remember we're
[00:02:54] going in nines
[00:02:55] if I pass nine I wrap around so 11 is
[00:02:58] really two right because 9 plus 2 is 11
[00:03:01] so my tally is 2 in my head and then the
[00:03:04] second letter was B right so B I know
[00:03:06] that a is 65 B is 66 so I had to let me
[00:03:10] add those two new digits 2 plus 6 is 8
[00:03:13] good 8 plus that second 6 is 14 which in
[00:03:18] my wraparound business is actually 5 9
[00:03:21] plus 5 is 14 so I'm not 5 ok now they
[00:03:24] continue with the number as usual but
[00:03:26] they have to skip one of the numbers I'm
[00:03:28] not privy to which number they chose
[00:03:31] right that's the whole point as I can
[00:03:32] guess it so let's say that we just
[00:03:34] skipped the last one which is a 1
[00:03:36] they're gonna tell me all the dues in a
[00:03:39] row right so 3 add it to the tally I
[00:03:41] have before I have 5 plus 3 is 8 okay
[00:03:44] plus 0 is still 8 plus 3 is 11 but
[00:03:48] remember we're wrapping around so that
[00:03:50] it's back to 2 plus 4 that's 6 plus 8
[00:03:54] that's now 14 wrapping around that goes
[00:03:56] back to 5 plus 0 that's still 5 plus 6
[00:04:00] that's 11 wrap around that's 2 8 2 plus
[00:04:05] 8 is 10 wrap around that's on that one
[00:04:07] 7 1 plus 7 is 8 and now whatever number
[00:04:13] you have at the end remember they left
[00:04:15] one digit out all you have to do
[00:04:16] subtract your number from 9 and that is
[00:04:18] remaining digits so I have 8 9 minus 8
[00:04:22] is 1 so the remaining missing digit is 1
[00:04:25] nice let's try another example here I
[00:04:29] don't have any other euro bills at the
[00:04:31] moment so let me look one up first I say
[00:04:33] ok there they pull this number out they
[00:04:35] read the letter which is at E so I look
[00:04:38] it up in my table remember a 65 Z's 90 T
[00:04:42] should be 84 8 plus 4 is 12
[00:04:45] it's actually 3 yeah now they continue
[00:04:47] with the whole number let's say that
[00:04:49] they leave out the number 9 so 3 plus 5
[00:04:52] that's 8 + 0 8 plus 0 that's 8 plus 4
[00:04:56] it's 12 but really that's 3 plus 3
[00:05:00] that's 6 skip the 9 plus 7 that's 13 so
[00:05:05] that's really 4 plus 1 5 plus 1 6 plus 5
[00:05:10] that's 11 really 2 plus 7 that's 9 which
[00:05:14] is basically zero so remember all you
[00:05:16] have to do with your last number is
[00:05:19] subtracted from 9 so 9 minus 0 is 9 and
[00:05:23] that's the missing digit pretty cool
[00:05:25] though so that's it just a quick little
[00:05:28] trip involves a minuscule amount of
[00:05:30] memory the rest is kind of just a little
[00:05:32] bit of math and it's kind of a cool
[00:05:34] trick that you can do with something
[00:05:35] that might be in your wallet next I'm
[00:05:36] gonna go to Europe if you're not from
[00:05:38] there it's an easy way to get a free
[00:05:40] gear
[00:05:41] everybody loves free beer that being
[00:05:43] said I'm out thanks for watching I'll be
[00:05:46] back in another video very shortly you

=== HOW TO MEMORIZE ALL THE WORLD CUP WINNERS IN HISTORY (in 10 minutes)!! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qH2RLf1XLQ

[00:00:00] is one of the most exciting times of
[00:00:03] year right now do you know what it is do
[00:00:05] you know what it is
[00:00:05] [Music]
[00:00:20] [Music]
[00:00:26] I've been waiting four years for this
[00:00:28] it's the 2018 World Cup every four years
[00:00:32] I go psycho I was born in England so I
[00:00:35] support England the three lions parents
[00:00:37] of French Belgian so I also back them up
[00:00:39] but England is the team for me and every
[00:00:41] time the World Cup comes around I like
[00:00:43] to show off my memory skills with
[00:00:45] knowledge about the World Cup that I
[00:00:47] just have memorized over the years for
[00:00:49] example who was the very first World Cup
[00:00:52] winner Uruguay in 1930 against Argentina
[00:00:55] 42 which took place in Montevideo
[00:00:57] Uruguay how many times does Italy won
[00:00:59] the World Cup
[00:01:00] actually they won it four times in 1934
[00:01:03] 1938 1982 and 2006 has England ever won
[00:01:07] the World Cup yes they won it in 1966
[00:01:10] against Germany for to West Germany for
[00:01:13] two at Wembley Stadium can you list the
[00:01:15] past five champions in a row Germany
[00:01:17] then before that Spain then before that
[00:01:19] Italy then before that Brazil then
[00:01:21] before that France damn son alright so
[00:01:23] let me show you how to memorize World
[00:01:24] Cup champions now I was thinking about
[00:01:26] this a lot I was wondering what would be
[00:01:28] the best thing to show you when a video
[00:01:29] is it knowing all the champions in order
[00:01:32] is it maybe knowing which countries have
[00:01:34] won how many times but I think the
[00:01:36] coolest one would be if somebody could
[00:01:38] say the year of a World Cup and you
[00:01:40] would instantly come back with a
[00:01:41] champion winner so technically you know
[00:01:43] all the countries who have won and what
[00:01:45] years they won so if I said Brazil you
[00:01:48] could say ok they won five times and the
[00:01:50] five years that they actually won the
[00:01:52] championship I said did Netherlands ever
[00:01:54] win you would be like no because you
[00:01:56] know all the championship winners and
[00:01:57] Netherlands have never won they've been
[00:01:59] to the finals though to be able to do
[00:02:00] this since there are numbers involved
[00:02:03] you need to be somewhat familiar with a
[00:02:04] number system there's a video that I've
[00:02:06] done in the past teaching what's called
[00:02:08] the major system that's the quickest
[00:02:09] easiest way to learn how to memorize
[00:02:11] numbers I'll link it in the description
[00:02:12] now if you watched it but maybe you
[00:02:15] don't remember what the major system was
[00:02:16] I'm gonna put it up here in the corner
[00:02:18] as a reference for the rest of this
[00:02:20] video so that you know how to convert
[00:02:22] numbers into letters and that's little
[00:02:24] point we can burn numbers into letters
[00:02:25] and those letters make words so we pick
[00:02:28] the work so what we're gonna do is
[00:02:29] basically take an image to represent the
[00:02:31] country and that will be easy because we
[00:02:32] just think of the first thing that comes
[00:02:34] to mind when we think of that country
[00:02:35] stereotype it can be food it can be
[00:02:38] something cultural whatever comes to
[00:02:40] mind we'll come up with it together and
[00:02:41] then we're gonna associate that image
[00:02:43] with images for the year or the multiple
[00:02:47] years that they've won translated into
[00:02:49] words either major systems smash those
[00:02:51] together that's pretty much it
[00:02:53] first things first there's a couple
[00:02:55] World Cup things you need to know before
[00:02:57] we start memorizing one is that there's
[00:02:59] only been 20 World Cups since 1930 which
[00:03:03] is when it started there was a bit of a
[00:03:04] gap between 1938 and the next one which
[00:03:08] was 1950 for obvious reasons but there's
[00:03:11] only been 20 overall cool second thing
[00:03:13] you need to know and this makes it even
[00:03:14] easier to memorize this is that there's
[00:03:16] only been 8 different countries that
[00:03:18] have won the World Cup over these 20
[00:03:19] Championships will memorize them
[00:03:21] properly but it's Spain England France
[00:03:24] Brazil Italy Germany Argentina and
[00:03:27] Uruguay some of those were West Germany
[00:03:29] at the time but let's just consider that
[00:03:31] in Germany so what's gonna happen is I'm
[00:03:33] going to save the country where we'll
[00:03:34] start with the country that's one the
[00:03:36] least and go up to the one that's one
[00:03:37] the most I'll help you come up with a
[00:03:39] picture for the country and then however
[00:03:41] many championship years they've had
[00:03:42] we'll come up with a word to represent
[00:03:45] the two-digit year so we have a
[00:03:46] two-digit number and some of these
[00:03:47] countries have multiple two-digit
[00:03:49] numbers right because they've won many
[00:03:50] times we'll just come up with a picture
[00:03:52] for that and then we'll associate the
[00:03:53] two together it's pretty easy you're
[00:03:55] just gonna make a really weird crazy
[00:03:56] story and you'll have it stuff all right
[00:04:00] the first one is Spain and they've only
[00:04:03] won at once they wanted in 2010 which is
[00:04:05] in South Africa all I care about is the
[00:04:07] number 10 you just got to recognize 10
[00:04:09] and associated with Spain the image for
[00:04:11] the number 10 1-0 using our system here
[00:04:14] is going to be hose 1 & 0
[00:04:17] that's a T or D and an S or Z I like to
[00:04:20] think of toes what do I think of for
[00:04:21] Spain for Spain I'm gonna think of a
[00:04:23] bullfighter and his whole getup and he's
[00:04:26] got the cape that's read everything and
[00:04:28] charging him are a series of toes maybe
[00:04:31] they've got horns because they look like
[00:04:32] bulls help you remember
[00:04:34] but there's multiple toes plural right
[00:04:36] just come in one after the other each
[00:04:38] kind of like this menace
[00:04:39] in tow shaped bull okay so we have Spain
[00:04:42] toes Spain ten Spain winner of the 2010
[00:04:47] World Cup next my favorite its England
[00:04:50] of course this was 1966 it was that one
[00:04:53] lone star they've only won one
[00:04:55] championship so we just got that one two
[00:04:57] digit number six six using my system
[00:05:00] again the word that I like to choose
[00:05:01] four six six is judge so my picture for
[00:05:04] England is Big Ben so I'm gonna picture
[00:05:07] a judge with his gavel and his row
[00:05:10] whatever at the top of Big Bend slamming
[00:05:13] down his gavel and making judgment upon
[00:05:16] all those with community so we're in
[00:05:18] England pictured there picture Big Ben
[00:05:20] and that judge sitting on top of the
[00:05:22] tower alright the next one another
[00:05:24] single winner is France
[00:05:26] my dad's French so I have a soft spot
[00:05:28] for these guys out of a blue and they
[00:05:29] won their World Cup in 1998 so all I
[00:05:32] care about is the nine eight ninety
[00:05:34] eight nine eight in my system here
[00:05:36] translates to beef which is pretty
[00:05:39] fitting because when I go to France
[00:05:41] under the Eiffel Tower I usually go to a
[00:05:44] restaurant where I'm eating steak frites
[00:05:46] so that's beef right so to imagine that
[00:05:48] there is a big beef steak frite going on
[00:05:52] and you're sitting under the Eiffel
[00:05:53] Tower it's romantic guy plane for you
[00:05:56] got a baguette under your arm all the
[00:05:58] really cheesy stuff in France reading
[00:06:00] beef under the Eiffel Tower alright the
[00:06:03] next one is going to be a two
[00:06:05] championship winner and the country is
[00:06:07] Uruguay and they want a long time ago
[00:06:10] 1930 the first ever and 1950 so all I
[00:06:14] got to remember is the 30 and the 50
[00:06:16] using my system again 30 could be Mouse
[00:06:19] 50 could be lace so my image for that
[00:06:23] could be like a mouse lacing up his
[00:06:26] shoes right it's got a mouse with lace
[00:06:29] now Uruguay it's a bit tricky it doesn't
[00:06:32] stand out as much with obvious images
[00:06:34] like England France Spain but for
[00:06:36] Uruguay their emblem is the Sun picture
[00:06:39] of the Sun burning this mouse as he's
[00:06:41] tying his lace on the surface of this
[00:06:43] Sun the next one is Argentina they also
[00:06:46] won twice in 1978 and 1986 so we have to
[00:06:50] remember 78 and 86 so the words using my
[00:06:54] system again for 78 could be cave and
[00:06:57] for 86 could be fish Argentina I think
[00:07:01] of the tango I think of this couple
[00:07:03] really dressed beautifully and sexy
[00:07:06] whatever with a rose in the woman's
[00:07:07] mouth the guys dipping her they're doing
[00:07:09] the tango to some really tango esque
[00:07:11] songs cave and fish so let's imagine
[00:07:14] that there
[00:07:15] tange going into a cave and somehow as
[00:07:19] he dips her she actually NAB's some fish
[00:07:22] out of this little pool that's in the
[00:07:24] cave there's a couple doing the tango
[00:07:25] Kate fish the big guns now Italy has won
[00:07:29] four times they won as I said before in
[00:07:32] 1934 1938 1982 and 2006 which is pretty
[00:07:36] recent for those four years right I have
[00:07:39] to have 34 38 82 and zero six so my
[00:07:43] words for those will be mower the lawn
[00:07:45] mower movie fan and sash so forwards a
[00:07:50] little harder but I just got to come up
[00:07:51] with a picture to string them all
[00:07:52] together so imagine you're mowing the
[00:07:54] lawn you got a mower right and your
[00:07:56] friend calls you up to go to the movie
[00:07:57] you're a huge fan of this movie maybe
[00:08:00] it's a real Italian flick about food and
[00:08:04] romance and black and white yeah do you
[00:08:14] have this mower you go to the movie is
[00:08:17] you're a huge fan of Italian movies you
[00:08:19] wear a sash kind of around you cuz
[00:08:21] you're you're like this director want to
[00:08:23] be in your fans
[00:08:24] and you go to this movie mower movie fan
[00:08:27] sash and to tie it to Italy right we can
[00:08:30] have an image for Italy like I said it
[00:08:32] could be an Italian movie think of like
[00:08:34] the language the food the picture that
[00:08:38] all in one and that's the movie you're
[00:08:40] going to see that your huge fan of that
[00:08:42] you wear the sash out after you go
[00:08:43] mowing let's move on to Germany they
[00:08:45] have also won four times and most
[00:08:47] recently in 2014 so the years that they
[00:08:50] won I believe were 1954 1974 1990 and
[00:08:56] 2014 5474 nine zero and one for 14
[00:09:03] Germany makes me think of Tober fest
[00:09:05] that kind of thing for 54 we have lure
[00:09:07] for 74 we have car 90 we have bus 14 we
[00:09:12] have tire lure car bus tire let me
[00:09:15] imagine that I'm lured to an Oktoberfest
[00:09:18] festival I get in my car I get hit by a
[00:09:21] bus tires go flying everywhere
[00:09:23] maybe your tires are made of pretzels
[00:09:25] German the very impresses I'd last
[00:09:28] champion and they've won the most five
[00:09:30] its Brazil right and so Brazil for that
[00:09:33] country I think of carnival people
[00:09:36] dressed up to the nines women with big
[00:09:39] feather contraptions on their head and
[00:09:41] sparkly clothes doing the Samba so the
[00:09:44] five years that day one were 1958 1960
[00:09:47] to 1970 1994 and 2002 okay so we have
[00:09:52] five words there that's kind of
[00:09:53] stretching us to the limit here but we
[00:09:55] can do it so for those five years I'm
[00:09:56] gonna come up with five words lava chain
[00:10:00] gas bear and Sun we somehow got a link
[00:10:03] this all into a story so let's imagine
[00:10:05] that there's lava everywhere right maybe
[00:10:08] it's carnival alright people are
[00:10:09] parading down the streets they're
[00:10:11] dancing samba all dressed up and some
[00:10:13] lava is chasing after them down the
[00:10:15] street what makes it worse is that
[00:10:16] everybody is chained to the ground so
[00:10:19] there's lava chains gasps alright maybe
[00:10:22] as this lava goes down these gas tanks
[00:10:26] explode and God
[00:10:27] getting drowsy and to make matters even
[00:10:30] worse and totally bizarre but memorable
[00:10:32] I want you to picture this giant grizzly
[00:10:35] bear massive also chasing down the
[00:10:37] people and he is holding the Sun in his
[00:10:41] hands as if he's gonna throw it on these
[00:10:43] people what if the Brazilians do oh my
[00:10:44] god
[00:10:45] all right so we have Brazilians doing
[00:10:47] Samba whatever they're trying to escape
[00:10:48] the lava to change the gas the bear and
[00:10:51] the Sun the red hot Sun I know what
[00:10:56] you're thinking Nelson I don't really
[00:10:58] know the major system so if somebody
[00:11:01] says to me who won in 1938 how am I
[00:11:05] gonna know you just taught me how to
[00:11:06] memorize a bunch of words related to a
[00:11:08] country huh yes true you kind of have to
[00:11:11] know this major system I recommend you
[00:11:13] take five minutes to just learn it it's
[00:11:15] not that hard and with a bit of practice
[00:11:17] you'll know it at least with the
[00:11:18] pictures that I gave you it's in your
[00:11:20] head right the hard part is now just to
[00:11:22] translate it so if I say 1938 knowing
[00:11:26] the major system you got to think okay
[00:11:27] three is an m8 is a foot Orvis sound so
[00:11:32] I should know movie right and when I
[00:11:35] think of movie what do I think of I
[00:11:38] think of Italy right because that was
[00:11:40] part of my story right that was with the
[00:11:42] mower the movie the fan the sash and I
[00:11:45] was going to see a Thai movie so if you
[00:11:47] can do that process quick and you can
[00:11:48] already take your time but you don't
[00:11:50] need to ask Google or Alexa you can just
[00:11:52] think for a moment and figure it out
[00:11:54] 1938 38 is movie movie was part of my
[00:11:58] story for Italy Italy won in 1938 my
[00:12:01] friend all right that's it guys I hope
[00:12:03] that was helpful all you have to do is
[00:12:05] watch this video and you suddenly know

[00:12:08] World Cup over the entire history thanks
[00:12:11] for watching guys I hope that helps
[00:12:12] enjoy the World Cup and love this thing

=== Q & A #1 // RANDOM MEMORY TIPS 18.8 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGyxkGfqjok

[00:00:00] what's up guys another random memory
[00:00:03] tips video except in this video I'm
[00:00:05] really not giving random memory tips I'm
[00:00:07] actually going to be answering some of
[00:00:10] the questions that I receive over the
[00:00:12] past year and a half on YouTube a lot of
[00:00:15] the questions are maybe things I didn't
[00:00:17] get to cover in the video or haven't
[00:00:19] made a video about yet figured why not
[00:00:21] go through some of these questions like
[00:00:23] bang a few out alright nice could you do
[00:00:32] more of these memory tricks and tips
[00:00:35] sure I would love to have a video every
[00:00:38] week for you guys every Monday or every
[00:00:41] Wednesday whatever but it's tough I have
[00:00:44] a lot going on so I try my best
[00:00:46] sometimes i film with the intention of
[00:00:48] getting something out as soon as
[00:00:50] possible but I sit on that video for a
[00:00:52] long time other things creep up but I
[00:00:54] will try to keep it more regular
[00:00:55] especially during the summer my goal
[00:00:57] last year was to do at least one video
[00:00:59] per month which I think I did about 12
[00:01:01] this year I was gonna do two a month I'm
[00:01:03] behind on that but hopefully I can pick
[00:01:04] it up in the summertime sure to avoid
[00:01:07] some vocab and to keep everything inside
[00:01:09] head then we should use tongue to talk
[00:01:12] in mind or what clearly clear this my
[00:01:15] huge doubt thanks I think what the
[00:01:18] person is asking is do i sub vocalize
[00:01:20] when i memorize the answer is yes I say
[00:01:24] what I'm reading in a quiet little voice
[00:01:27] inside my mind I think it's impossible
[00:01:29] to get rid of that voice obviously if
[00:01:31] that voice didn't exists you could maybe
[00:01:34] memorize faster because you wouldn't
[00:01:35] have to take take the time to say the
[00:01:37] words in your mind an approach that
[00:01:39] people have taken to shorten this with
[00:01:41] too quick in this is to have codes that
[00:01:44] are shorter words so for numbers for
[00:01:46] example my sixteen one six is Arnold
[00:01:50] Schwarzenegger I say Arnold
[00:01:51] Schwarzenegger in my mind which is long
[00:01:53] I should probably just say Barney or
[00:01:56] Schwarz or something so and yes I do
[00:01:58] some vocalize I personally am a believer
[00:02:00] that that it's crucial to making a
[00:02:02] memory some people believe that you have
[00:02:04] to get rid of it and you'll be fast
[00:02:05] about that you can memorize that way
[00:02:07] personal opinion okay this is a long
[00:02:09] question but basically it's asking what
[00:02:11] do you think of different explanations
[00:02:12] that have been offered for the origins
[00:02:14] of the major system why these sounds and
[00:02:17] not others good question your guess is
[00:02:19] as good as mine I know that in history
[00:02:21] the history of the major technique of
[00:02:23] the major system that there have been
[00:02:25] other choices for consonants Lewis
[00:02:29] Carroll guy ruined house in Wonderland
[00:02:31] had very different letters there were a
[00:02:34] few iterations of what we now know
[00:02:37] there's a major system but the one that
[00:02:38] is popular now is the one that stuff I
[00:02:40] think in short it doesn't matter as long
[00:02:42] as you choose something that you learn
[00:02:44] and you make real then that should work
[00:02:46] there's no I don't think
[00:02:49] efficiency with these specific number
[00:02:52] letter combinations other than it's just
[00:02:53] popular hey man can you suggest me some
[00:02:56] books that you used sure I can when I
[00:02:58] started I actually started with an audio
[00:03:00] book by Dominic O'Brien quantum memory
[00:03:02] power I don't really like any other
[00:03:04] memory books I mean other than
[00:03:07] moonwalking with Einstein I love when
[00:03:09] walking with Einstein I love the way
[00:03:11] Josh before writes and that book I'm
[00:03:13] obsessed with it's just the classic tome
[00:03:15] for everything that I do with memory
[00:03:19] sports in terms of other stuff no don't
[00:03:23] bother just look online or watch my
[00:03:25] videos how do not have a million subs
[00:03:27] yet these are some super high quality
[00:03:29] vids I know that's what I've been
[00:03:31] wondering why don't I have a million
[00:03:33] subs I'm closing in on 10k though that's
[00:03:38] exciting
[00:03:38] I like your video have a nice day please
[00:03:42] explain Alex Mullins system in a simple
[00:03:45] way
[00:03:48] I'll do that another video please can
[00:03:50] you tell me the name of a book he used
[00:03:52] to train your memory what I said before
[00:03:53] also did but the music is annoying and
[00:03:55] distracting I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not
[00:04:00] the best at necessarily putting all
[00:04:02] these videos together I'm getting better
[00:04:04] I love music and I love putting my
[00:04:07] videos to music so I'm not gonna get rid
[00:04:10] of music ever but I will try to be
[00:04:12] conscious of the choices that make
[00:04:15] sometimes I think a track is awesome and
[00:04:16] I want to use it only to listen to it
[00:04:18] later and realize that yeah that might
[00:04:21] have been not a good track to choose
[00:04:23] only 2000 or so people are watching this
[00:04:26] video yet like 4 billion people are
[00:04:28] watching Vespa Seto
[00:04:29] how sad lol I agree there should be 4
[00:04:33] billion people watching this video right
[00:04:35] now although this besito I've watched
[00:04:38] that video a few times is there any way
[00:04:41] to contact you because I want to talk to
[00:04:43] you on the phone if it's ok it's
[00:04:46] probably not ok no offence love you all
[00:04:49] but yeah you can email me go to my
[00:04:51] website Nelson Dellis calm well that
[00:04:57] leaves me out I don't give a crap about
[00:04:58] athletes or celebrities and can't
[00:05:00] remember enough of my relatives fast
[00:05:01] enough this is a reference to developing
[00:05:04] your Pio system for cards I use the
[00:05:07] example of categorizing the different
[00:05:09] suits one being family and friends
[00:05:11] another being celebrities athletes
[00:05:13] musicians whatever ok so for this kind
[00:05:16] of person you know there's got to be
[00:05:18] something that you are interested in if
[00:05:20] you have no interest in your relatives
[00:05:22] friends celebrities athletes characters
[00:05:26] and books video games anything you
[00:05:28] should have something in your life
[00:05:30] otherwise
[00:05:33] nice work can you make an example with a
[00:05:36] physics textbook I think this is
[00:05:38] reference to memorizing the text or
[00:05:41] passages of text I will do the video on
[00:05:43] this because I think that's a great
[00:05:44] question in short it's basically you
[00:05:47] have two sides of an equation right
[00:05:48] equals sign in the middle it's just
[00:05:50] about coming up with pictures for the
[00:05:52] symbols on the left hand side and
[00:05:53] symbols on the right hand side and
[00:05:55] making them associate to each other I'll
[00:05:58] do some examples in a future video
[00:06:01] pretty idea Nelson what do I do if I
[00:06:03] forgive my memory palace yeah ideally
[00:06:06] you want to choose a memory palace that
[00:06:07] you won't forget so the best memory
[00:06:09] palace are the ones that you know very
[00:06:11] well that you really can't forget but
[00:06:13] there even if you know very well you may
[00:06:15] have a large memory palace with multiple
[00:06:18] anchor points and maybe you forgot one
[00:06:21] or two along the way that happens to me
[00:06:23] actually because I'm these really long
[00:06:24] ones I forget whether I stopped at that
[00:06:26] point or that point so I usually write
[00:06:28] them down when I come up with them I
[00:06:30] just write them down in a book notebook
[00:06:32] or Google Drive I keep all of them and
[00:06:35] that ways are there and I if I ever
[00:06:37] forget I can go on review it it
[00:06:40] shouldn't be too hard to remember right
[00:06:41] it's supposed to be instinctive pass
[00:06:43] through something you know just
[00:06:44] naturally taking out some eminently
[00:06:46] useful do you have any thoughts on
[00:06:48] memorizing games especially chess and go
[00:06:51] cool go I don't know how to play chess
[00:06:54] sure and how to play it I've been
[00:06:56] challenged to memorize a chess board I
[00:06:58] came up with a little strategy for it I
[00:07:00] think anything you can come up with a
[00:07:02] strategy to memorize
[00:07:03] chess board might be a cool video to do
[00:07:05] in the future think about it you just
[00:07:06] have a 8x8 grid a certain number of
[00:07:09] pieces to different colors and come up
[00:07:12] with a system when is the best time to
[00:07:14] review I know that there has been some
[00:07:15] discussion about the amounts of time
[00:07:17] that should pass before reviewing and
[00:07:19] those time points being crucial to long
[00:07:20] time legal Nelson what do you do yeah it
[00:07:22] depends on what I'm memorizing if it's
[00:07:24] in competition and the time is very
[00:07:27] limited I usually do like a 6040
[00:07:30] memorizing review split so 60% of the
[00:07:33] time I'm memorizing 40% of the time
[00:07:36] viewing in terms of stuff that I want to
[00:07:40] actually learn and keep and store my
[00:07:43] brain I'll memorize it typically review
[00:07:47] the crap out of it a bunch that first
[00:07:48] day and then then I just I don't know I
[00:07:51] don't really have a formula for it I
[00:07:52] just kind of do it a lot that first week
[00:07:54] then maybe every once every once in a
[00:07:57] while the next week and taper off slowly
[00:07:59] like that all depends on how well I know
[00:08:01] the information he looks he looks like a
[00:08:05] porn star named Erik Everard
[00:08:07] you're not the first person to tell me
[00:08:08] that mr. Delos
[00:08:10] I have a question regarding the memory
[00:08:11] cause I'm currently have 30 locations
[00:08:14] stored as a hundred digits of pi so does
[00:08:17] that mean I can never use that 30
[00:08:18] location again as long as I want to
[00:08:20] remember PI great question basically can
[00:08:24] you tape over memory palaces if you've
[00:08:27] stored something there that you want to
[00:08:28] keep there forever you can I've done it
[00:08:31] I have places where I keep one specific
[00:08:34] set of information and I've used it to
[00:08:36] memorize something else that was not for
[00:08:38] a long time just for temporary use the
[00:08:40] answer is depends how well you know
[00:08:42] what's already stored there if it's been
[00:08:44] there for years and it's solidified and
[00:08:46] sure probably reusing it for something
[00:08:48] else quickly won't change anything but
[00:08:50] if it's pretty fresh and then you're
[00:08:52] putting something that's something you
[00:08:54] want to keep for a while that's gonna
[00:08:56] get messy so I tend to use things that
[00:08:58] are changing a lot that I need to
[00:09:01] remember for a short period of time and
[00:09:02] it forget I have a memory pass that I
[00:09:04] empty out and put new things in all the
[00:09:07] time when it's usually something I want
[00:09:09] to keep forever I usually keep that
[00:09:11] aside so with your 32 years of PI I
[00:09:13] would keep that separate just to keep it
[00:09:15] special and easier to remember how many
[00:09:18] places do you use in the competition I'm
[00:09:20] very curious about this how many memory
[00:09:22] causes that's I don't want to count them
[00:09:25] but I know in total and must have at
[00:09:27] least 50 to 75 different memory palaces
[00:09:30] for everything and for all of my
[00:09:33] training I don't use that many
[00:09:34] every competition but they're there for
[00:09:36] the use but they very different size and
[00:09:37] some four cards are very short some four
[00:09:40] numbers are super long like 100
[00:09:42] locations long can you tell how to twin
[00:09:46] my memory palace by the only one who
[00:09:50] finds it impossible to think of five
[00:09:52] places with ten locations which I know
[00:09:53] so well that I don't need to memorize
[00:09:55] them I mean if you remember that well
[00:09:57] your childhood home your memory must be
[00:09:59] pretty good already why bother you're
[00:10:00] creating memory palaces sure it's handy
[00:10:02] if you want to memorize the first 10,000
[00:10:04] digits of pi but why the hell would you
[00:10:05] want to do that lots of questions here
[00:10:09] one helmet I want to do that meaning the
[00:10:11] ten thousands of Pi why do you play
[00:10:15] soccer or go to the gym in terms of
[00:10:18] finding it hard to think of five places
[00:10:20] with ten locations
[00:10:21] I don't understand that I can be hard
[00:10:23] just think of your house and choose ten
[00:10:26] pieces of furniture ten things in your
[00:10:28] apartment it doesn't even have to be an
[00:10:29] actual thing it could be a corner of a
[00:10:32] chair a foot of the chair the edge of
[00:10:35] the wall the outlet but if you can't
[00:10:37] then you're not trying hard enough and
[00:10:39] also remembering childhood homes yeah
[00:10:40] sure maybe you don't remember fine a lot
[00:10:44] of mine honestly I didn't really
[00:10:46] remember even correctly I just from what
[00:10:49] I remember I made something up and from
[00:10:51] pictures I've seen I kind of piece it
[00:10:53] together I've been back to memory
[00:10:55] palaces that I created and they were
[00:10:58] completely wrong so it doesn't really
[00:11:00] matter it's what I'm saying excellent
[00:11:03] video a question are you able to
[00:11:05] memorize a whole book if yes how long
[00:11:07] can you keep it in your memory I never
[00:11:08] tried to memorize a whole book I'm
[00:11:09] pretty confident I could it just takes
[00:11:11] time
[00:11:13] commitment there's not a real book that
[00:11:15] I would want to commit to memory
[00:11:16] although I was playing at one point to
[00:11:19] memorize the Hobbit but that would be a
[00:11:20] cool thing Nelson can you be my friend
[00:11:22] yeah why not
[00:11:23] the dog is real dog is very real he's
[00:11:28] actually a French Bulldog his name is
[00:11:29] Henry and he's dozing off over there
[00:11:32] what was your inspiration to become a
[00:11:34] memory champion my inspiration was my
[00:11:37] grandmother she passed away from
[00:11:38] Alzheimer's
[00:11:39] I wanted him for my memory I also wanted
[00:11:43] to be good at something so that together
[00:11:46] that's it
[00:11:47] Nelson why don't you make a video about
[00:11:48] winning at blackjack with memory drinks
[00:11:51] well because you don't need memory
[00:11:53] tricks to win a blackjack do you cube I
[00:11:56] do not very well but I do and I can I
[00:11:59] can also do a blindfolded few more
[00:12:01] questions Billie Jean Paul says we is
[00:12:04] there a cash prize for winning contests
[00:12:05] or mate setting a record I know some of
[00:12:08] these guys make money trying to sell
[00:12:09] their own memory systems based on their
[00:12:10] fame credibility no not really I kind of
[00:12:15] sometimes depends the world
[00:12:17] championships there's been surprised
[00:12:18] money u.s. championship no yeah teach me
[00:12:23] your ways when is your next Everest trip
[00:12:24] good question I was supposed to be
[00:12:26] actually right now but I'm having a baby
[00:12:29] and August so pushing that back
[00:12:31] hopefully 2005 alright last question
[00:12:34] thanks for the video and Elson notice it
[00:12:37] when you in this video you use the
[00:12:39] dominant system in your system you use
[00:12:41] major system for numbers and then use
[00:12:42] nominal systems with PA oh okay he's
[00:12:44] referring to another video I did on the
[00:12:46] major system where I was explaining the
[00:12:49] major system I don't necessarily use it
[00:12:51] I know how to use it and I have used it
[00:12:53] but when I memorize numbers my go-to is
[00:12:55] the Domenic system so I prefer that I
[00:12:58] think PA
[00:12:59] it's the best if you've already come up
[00:13:01] with your zero 0 to 99 your two-digit
[00:13:04] system with major system how do you move
[00:13:06] it over a person action object go
[00:13:07] through your list and for those things
[00:13:09] that are objects just come up with a
[00:13:11] person and action associated with that
[00:13:13] the things that are people or characters
[00:13:15] just come up with an action and object
[00:13:18] thanks for the questions guys there were
[00:13:20] a ton of other questions but I can't get
[00:13:21] to them all maybe I'll do another video
[00:13:23] of these down the road love you guys
[00:13:25] thanks for all the support let's carry
[00:13:27] on and get to that 10,000 subscribers
[00:13:29] that would be amazing
[00:13:30] love you all I'm out

=== INSANE MONEY TRICK! // RANDOM MEMORY TIPS 18.7 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcAHENMvCc8

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:09] what I have here is a five euro bill I'm
[00:00:14] going to show you how to do a pretty
[00:00:15] cool trick with the serial code that is
[00:00:18] on any of these bills
[00:00:20] five to ten to 20 50 100 200 500 if you
[00:00:23] ever traveled to Europe or you are you
[00:00:25] repeat then if you have one of these
[00:00:27] laying around it's a really cool trick
[00:00:28] that you can just do at a bar your
[00:00:30] friends and really impress them so let's
[00:00:32] go
[00:00:36] [Music]
[00:00:44] so the way it works is basically the
[00:00:47] serial number here starts with a letter
[00:00:49] in the case of the five euro though it's
[00:00:51] actually two letters for whatever reason
[00:00:53] doesn't matter it's the same thing all
[00:00:54] the others start with one letter then
[00:00:55] it's followed by a series of numbers now
[00:00:58] what's cool about this serial number is
[00:01:00] that when you add it all together each
[00:01:02] digit it's a number that's divisible by
[00:01:04] nine what that means is that actually
[00:01:07] you can keep adding all these numbers
[00:01:09] and every time you get to a total of
[00:01:12] something that's nine or greater you can
[00:01:14] start back over at zero and then by the
[00:01:16] time you've added everything together
[00:01:18] your answer should equal nine or zero
[00:01:22] however you want to look at it this is
[00:01:24] called casting out nines the way it
[00:01:26] works is say I have four and then I add
[00:01:29] seven my answer would be eleven but the
[00:01:32] way this math works casting out nines is
[00:01:34] every time you pass nine you start back
[00:01:37] over at zero basically you're just
[00:01:38] taking the remainder right so if I'm at
[00:01:41] eleven that's actually really - because
[00:01:43] I reached nine and then nine plus two
[00:01:46] gives me the eleven so I'm never really
[00:01:49] counting past nine and if I do I have to
[00:01:51] wrap around and do the math so that I
[00:01:53] know the exact number past nine that it
[00:01:55] should be okay what you can do is ask
[00:01:57] your friend to read this out and to omit
[00:01:59] one number don't say one of the numbers
[00:02:01] and you'll be able to tell them what the
[00:02:04] missing number is ooh now what do you do
[00:02:06] about the letter this is the memory part
[00:02:08] it's just a little bit of memory and
[00:02:09] that's what I'm here for
[00:02:11] there's something called the ASCII code
[00:02:13] and any capital letter in the alphabet A
[00:02:16] through Z has a decimal number that
[00:02:19] represents it in this ASCII table it's
[00:02:21] used for computer science stuff don't
[00:02:23] worry about it well you gotta remember
[00:02:23] is that capital A or a is 65 and maybe
[00:02:28] also know that Z is 19 you can figure
[00:02:31] out all the other letters by just
[00:02:33] counting in your head a is 65 that means
[00:02:35] that B is 66 67 and so on I know that Z
[00:02:42] is 90 so S is probably let me count
[00:02:45] backwards 83 so with that number 83 I do
[00:02:48] the process I add the digits together 8
[00:02:51] plus 3 which is 11 but remember we're
[00:02:54] going in nines
[00:02:55] if I pass nine I wrap around so 11 is
[00:02:58] really two right because 9 plus 2 is 11
[00:03:01] so my tally is 2 in my head and then the
[00:03:04] second letter was B right so B I know
[00:03:06] that a is 65 B is 66 so I had to let me
[00:03:10] add those two new digits 2 plus 6 is 8
[00:03:13] good 8 plus that second 6 is 14 which in
[00:03:18] my wraparound business is actually 5 9
[00:03:21] plus 5 is 14 so I'm not 5 ok now they
[00:03:24] continue with the number as usual but
[00:03:26] they have to skip one of the numbers I'm
[00:03:28] not privy to which number they chose
[00:03:31] right that's the whole point as I can
[00:03:32] guess it so let's say that we just
[00:03:34] skipped the last one which is a 1
[00:03:36] they're gonna tell me all the dues in a
[00:03:39] row right so 3 add it to the tally I
[00:03:41] have before I have 5 plus 3 is 8 okay
[00:03:44] plus 0 is still 8 plus 3 is 11 but
[00:03:48] remember we're wrapping around so that
[00:03:50] it's back to 2 plus 4 that's 6 plus 8
[00:03:54] that's now 14 wrapping around that goes
[00:03:56] back to 5 plus 0 that's still 5 plus 6
[00:04:00] that's 11 wrap around that's 2 8 2 plus
[00:04:05] 8 is 10 wrap around that's on that one
[00:04:07] 7 1 plus 7 is 8 and now whatever number
[00:04:13] you have at the end remember they left
[00:04:15] one digit out all you have to do
[00:04:16] subtract your number from 9 and that is
[00:04:18] remaining digits so I have 8 9 minus 8
[00:04:22] is 1 so the remaining missing digit is 1
[00:04:25] nice let's try another example here I
[00:04:29] don't have any other euro bills at the
[00:04:31] moment so let me look one up first I say
[00:04:33] ok there they pull this number out they
[00:04:35] read the letter which is at E so I look
[00:04:38] it up in my table remember a 65 Z's 90 T
[00:04:42] should be 84 8 plus 4 is 12
[00:04:45] it's actually 3 yeah now they continue
[00:04:47] with the whole number let's say that
[00:04:49] they leave out the number 9 so 3 plus 5
[00:04:52] that's 8 + 0 8 plus 0 that's 8 plus 4
[00:04:56] it's 12 but really that's 3 plus 3
[00:05:00] that's 6 skip the 9 plus 7 that's 13 so
[00:05:05] that's really 4 plus 1 5 plus 1 6 plus 5
[00:05:10] that's 11 really 2 plus 7 that's 9 which
[00:05:14] is basically zero so remember all you
[00:05:16] have to do with your last number is
[00:05:19] subtracted from 9 so 9 minus 0 is 9 and
[00:05:23] that's the missing digit pretty cool
[00:05:25] though so that's it just a quick little
[00:05:28] trip involves a minuscule amount of
[00:05:30] memory the rest is kind of just a little
[00:05:32] bit of math and it's kind of a cool
[00:05:34] trick that you can do with something
[00:05:35] that might be in your wallet next I'm
[00:05:36] gonna go to Europe if you're not from
[00:05:38] there it's an easy way to get a free
[00:05:40] gear
[00:05:41] everybody loves free beer that being
[00:05:43] said I'm out thanks for watching I'll be
[00:05:46] back in another video very shortly you

[00:00:11] what's up guys random memory tips I'm
[00:00:14] going to teach you something kind of not
[00:00:15] memory but involves memory nonetheless
[00:00:19] [Music]
[00:00:29] this is actually out of my special
[00:00:33] treasured little book here that I've had
[00:00:36] since I was an undergrad at University
[00:00:38] and I pretty much written every cool
[00:00:41] little memory math mental whatever hack
[00:00:45] I've kept it written in here so it's
[00:00:47] filled chock damn with some awesome
[00:00:50] stuff that I treasure I wanted to share
[00:00:52] with you guys one of these things from
[00:00:54] here a cool little party trick it's
[00:00:56] actually a mental math trick you can do
[00:00:58] that means just a little bit of memory
[00:01:00] you got to memorize ten things and from
[00:01:02] there you can pretty much wow your
[00:01:03] friends on the spot so I'm going to
[00:01:05] teach you how to take the cube root of a
[00:01:08] two-digit number
[00:01:10] so if you take a two digit number
[00:01:12] multiplied by itself two times so let's
[00:01:16] say 36 times 36 times 36
[00:01:19] that's 36 to the third if you give me
[00:01:22] that number the answer I can tell you
[00:01:24] the original two digit number that's
[00:01:25] taking the cube root of that large
[00:01:27] number
[00:01:28] Wow sounds really impossible and your
[00:01:30] friends will be like how are you doing
[00:01:31] that math so fast but there's actually a
[00:01:33] really easy trick to it you just kind of
[00:01:35] memorize some things all you got to do
[00:01:37] is memorize this list of numbers
[00:01:39] basically you just have to know all the
[00:01:41] numbers from zero to ten what their cube
[00:01:44] is right if you multiply that single
[00:01:46] digit by itself 3 times 0 cubed is just
[00:01:48] 0 right and 0 times 0 times 0 1 cubed is
[00:01:52] 1 times 1 times 1 which is 1 2 cubed you
[00:01:57] may know right that's 2 times 2 times 2
[00:01:59] which is 8 3 cubed you might know and
[00:02:03] then pass that you may not know so 3
[00:02:04] times 3 times 3 3 times 3 is 9 9 times 3
[00:02:08] 27 4 cubed is 64 5 cubed is 125 6 cubed
[00:02:13] is 216 7 cubed is 343 8 cubed is 512 9
[00:02:18] cubed is 729 and then 10 cubed is a
[00:02:21] thousand alright so how does it work you
[00:02:24] ask your friend to choose a number
[00:02:25] between 0 and 100 enter it into their
[00:02:28] calculator
[00:02:29] multiplied by itself multiplied by
[00:02:32] itself again and tell you the answer and
[00:02:35] now you run from the answer back to that
[00:02:37] two-digit number let's say you're trying
[00:02:39] to find the cube root of two hundred
[00:02:40] sixty-two thousand one hundred and forty
[00:02:43] four now it's just a two-step process
[00:02:45] all the digits before the comma you're
[00:02:47] basically going to look on your mental
[00:02:49] chart of those ten digits I have a
[00:02:51] memory
[00:02:52] and what they're cute more where that
[00:02:54] number falls so if my number is 260 2144
[00:02:59] I take the two six two and I look in my
[00:03:02] mental map of all the ten digits and see
[00:03:04] where it falls six cubed is 216 I know
[00:03:08] that 7 cubed is 343 fits right in
[00:03:11] between the 6 and the 7 go to the lower
[00:03:13] bound so my first digit is 6 to get the
[00:03:16] second digit so now I know it's 67 thing
[00:03:18] I look at the very last digit of the
[00:03:20] answer the president gave me so my
[00:03:22] number was 260 2144 then looking up on
[00:03:26] my chart the only one that ends with
[00:03:29] before is 4 cubed so my answer is 64
[00:03:36] 195,000 112 so I first think of 195
[00:03:40] where does that fall on my chart 5 cubed
[00:03:44] is 125 6 cubed was 216 so 195 falls
[00:03:48] between 5 & 6 so I know my answer has to
[00:03:50] start with a 550 something then I look
[00:03:53] at the last that you wish to so - and I
[00:03:55] think in my chart which is the only
[00:03:56] number cube that has an answer that ends
[00:03:58] with the - 8 cubed is 512 - so it's 8 5
[00:04:03] 8 8
[00:04:05] what about 2001 97
[00:04:08] six hours
[00:04:11] [Music]
[00:04:22] that's it for this video guys I hope you
[00:04:24] enjoyed it that was very short very easy

=== HOW TO CREATE A 2-DIGIT PAO SYSTEM // RANDOM MEMORY TIPS 18.5 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-gCm3gEFQE

[00:00:00] welcome to another episode of random
[00:00:01] memory tips my name is Nelson Dellis I'm
[00:00:03] a four-time USA memory champion I
[00:00:06] thought that I would teach you today
[00:00:07] another number memorizing technique
[00:00:09] called
[00:00:09] PA ho it's what I use when I first
[00:00:12] started memorizing hundreds of numbers
[00:00:13] but I'm going to teach you how to set up
[00:00:15] your own PA o system and how to get
[00:00:17] really good at it ready let's go
[00:00:20] [Music]
[00:00:30] so PA o stands for person action object
[00:00:34] and if you saw my video on memorizing
[00:00:36] cards and talked about a little bit if
[00:00:38] you saw my video on how to remember
[00:00:39] numbers using the major system that's
[00:00:42] another way to memorize numbers this is
[00:00:43] a bit different to learn the PIO system
[00:00:45] you first have to learn what the numbers
[00:00:47] represent as letters what is our
[00:00:49] including system how are we gonna turn
[00:00:51] these complicated numbers into pictures
[00:00:52] so first things first we gotta learn
[00:00:54] with
[00:00:54] numbers represent as letters let's go
[00:00:58] [Music]
[00:01:26] manages to having this two-digit system
[00:01:28] all set up is that no matter what number
[00:01:31] you see you can always pair digits
[00:01:34] together and have an image set in my
[00:01:36] past video where I talked about the
[00:01:38] major system it was kind of a
[00:01:39] free-for-all you kind of read the
[00:01:41] numbers converted them into letters and
[00:01:43] hopes to make a word that made sense to
[00:01:45] it is a system that's fixed
[00:01:46] you always have an image for every two
[00:01:49] digits the person actually object part
[00:01:51] comes into play because we take those
[00:01:53] letters that you came up with and you
[00:01:54] make them into the initials of a person
[00:01:56] the next part once you have all 100
[00:01:59] people is to give them to action
[00:02:01] and then an object and so that part
[00:02:04] should be easy because it should be
[00:02:05] instinctive one of your people is me
[00:02:06] then his action is whatever reminds you
[00:02:09] of what I do so memorizing my action and
[00:02:12] objects might be a deck of cards but
[00:02:14] always memorizing things now coming up
[00:02:16] with a hundred different people with all
[00:02:18] those initials
[00:02:19] sounds pretty daunting and it kind of
[00:02:22] its kind of break it up into a few steps
[00:02:24] on how to fill out that list cuz that's
[00:02:26] the first thing you gotta fill out that
[00:02:27] list learn it and then you can start
[00:02:29] using it to memorize like a champ the
[00:02:35] first thing I want you to do is write
[00:02:37] down all 100 numbers zero zero all the
[00:02:40] way tonight it should take up a full
[00:02:42] page next thing I want you to do is to
[00:02:43] scan through those numbers and see if
[00:02:45] any numbers just instinctively pop out
[00:02:47] as anything what I mean by that is
[00:02:50] forget the system forget p.m. just look
[00:02:52] at a number and see does this two-digit
[00:02:54] number remind me of anything
[00:03:01] [Music]
[00:03:11] you get the idea the first step make a
[00:03:13] pass through all those numbers and see
[00:03:15] for any low-hanging fruit the second
[00:03:22] step is now to go through and to come up
[00:03:23] with as many as you can
[00:03:24] initials right so a good example is 72
[00:03:28] 72 is GB I thought of George Bush or
[00:03:33] former president one v AE Albert
[00:03:36] Einstein - six es pretty Spears 74 GED I
[00:03:44] think of Gerard Depardieu yes I pee on
[00:03:46] the play when you want to pee please go
[00:03:49] pee nobody can stop you if you want to
[00:03:52] pee because you can't die
[00:03:56] [Music]
[00:04:01] this may take some time and they have to
[00:04:04] step away come back when you think about
[00:04:06] it you're not gonna think of everybody
[00:04:07] on the spot but do your best at this
[00:04:14] point you probably have a few holes some
[00:04:17] numbers you just couldn't think of
[00:04:18] anything or maybe you look some up and
[00:04:20] you found something but it's not really
[00:04:22] a good one yep for those I would
[00:04:24] recommend it hopefully there's a few
[00:04:25] left at this
[00:04:26] think of people that you would like to
[00:04:28] have in your system like their family
[00:04:30] members best friends almost tend to
[00:04:31] things and make them purposefully one of
[00:04:34] the
[00:04:35] and give it a reason it doesn't have to
[00:04:37] be obvious at first but just make up a
[00:04:40] reason
[00:04:42] once you have all 100 of those numbers I
[00:04:46] know it's a bit of work but you can get
[00:04:48] through if you follow those steps and it
[00:04:49] may not happen overnight maybe it takes
[00:04:51] you a few days or a week you have your
[00:04:53] hundred numbers you want to get
[00:04:54] memorizing how do you do it before you
[00:04:56] start memorizing you got to give all
[00:04:58] those hundred people and action in the
[00:05:00] object like I said even though this
[00:05:02] sounds like a lot of work it should be
[00:05:03] intuitive but write them down right you
[00:05:06] have this list of 100 numbers you have
[00:05:07] the person written down also write in
[00:05:10] actions and objects they should all be
[00:05:11] unique don't give the same action to two
[00:05:14] different people don't give the same
[00:05:15] object you want it to be unique so that
[00:05:18] when you see it in your mind you know
[00:05:20] exactly what number it is
[00:05:23] [Music]
[00:05:33] last step is to just get started
[00:05:35] memorizing if you're looking at a long
[00:05:37] number you'll look at six digits at a
[00:05:39] time the first two of that six will be
[00:05:41] the person if you think of your list who
[00:05:43] the person is who represents those two
[00:05:45] digits then the next two will be the
[00:05:47] action associated with that number and
[00:05:50] the last two will be the object what you
[00:05:52] do is you combine that together and get
[00:05:54] the person doing the action with the
[00:05:56] thing that all represents six digits
[00:05:59] it's a person doing an action and an
[00:06:00] object PA and that image although it
[00:06:04] sounds a bit complicated when you put it
[00:06:06] together is the most memorable friggin
[00:06:08] thing you can think of it's going to be
[00:06:09] the weirdest combination and you'll
[00:06:11] never forget it then with those images
[00:06:13] you just use the memory palace or you
[00:06:15] use a linking system whatever you want
[00:06:16] to use to store it I've gone over that
[00:06:18] in other videos the important part about
[00:06:20] this method is it helps you encode big
[00:06:23] chunks of numbers and I've used this to
[00:06:25] memorise over 300 nearly 400 digits in a
[00:06:29] very short amount of time
[00:06:30] well I hope you enjoyed this video I
[00:06:32] hope you go and sit down right now come
[00:06:34] up with your 100 PA OS and you get
[00:06:36] started memorizing I want to see what
[00:06:38] competitions I want to see you
[00:06:39] memorizing hundreds hundreds of digits
[00:06:42] like it was butter
[00:06:44] just a bit of practice that's all I got
[00:06:46] for you today guys I'll see you in the
[00:06:47] next video you've been great love you
[00:06:49] guys

=== MEMORIZE 15 DIGITS OF PI IN 30 SECONDS!! // RANDOM MEMORY TIPS 18.4 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I5vsl15nmA

[00:00:00] it's pi day and i'm gonna have you
[00:00:03] memorized 15 digits of pi
[00:00:05] if i don't know 30 seconds let's do this
[00:00:08] so what is pi PI is hey Siri what is pi
[00:00:15] pi is the 16 foot pi is the ratio of the
[00:00:18] circumference of me I know pi is its
[00:00:20] it's the relation between the ratio
[00:00:22] between the circumference of the circle
[00:00:24] and its diameter that's really
[00:00:25] impressive
[00:00:26] Wow that doesn't matter most people just
[00:00:28] want to brag about how many digits they
[00:00:29] have most people just know 3.14 many
[00:00:32] years ago I did a show and I said if you
[00:00:35] want to know one more dish to just
[00:00:36] remember three point one four one
[00:00:39] most people know 3.14 you can just add
[00:00:41] another digit 3.14 one that's easy
[00:00:44] nice now we're gonna do 15 there are
[00:00:47] many ways to memorize pi break it into
[00:00:49] chunks recommend it's a phone number
[00:00:51] size chunks you can use the major since
[00:00:53] the PIO system even if it's a pot you
[00:00:55] can make up any number you like now but
[00:00:57] seriously the best way to do this to
[00:00:58] memorize is one sentence that if you
[00:01:00] know the sentence and you know 15 digits
[00:01:02] of pi just got to remember the sentence
[00:01:04] but remembering words in a sentence is
[00:01:07] easier than memorizing 15 random numbers
[00:01:09] important here it is how I want to drink
[00:01:13] alcoholic of course after the heavy
[00:01:15] lectures involving qualifications how
[00:01:18] does that work well if you break down
[00:01:20] each word the length for each word
[00:01:22] matches the digit that is in those 15
[00:01:25] digits of pi
[00:01:26] so how 3 I 1 want for one drink
[00:01:35] 5 3.1415 alcoholic of course 9 to 6
[00:01:40] after the 5 three heavy lectures
[00:01:44] involving quantum mechanics 5 8 9 7 9 so
[00:01:47] that's 15 digits amazing first super
[00:01:49] nerdy one keep taking that up to 32
[00:01:52] digits
[00:01:52] you just add this extra part on it just
[00:01:54] for the Nerds out there who want to take
[00:01:56] it even further yeah good luck with that
[00:01:58] one if that sentence is tough for you to
[00:01:59] memorize watch my video on how to
[00:02:01] memorize lines you can memorize that by
[00:02:03] just writing down the first letter of
[00:02:04] every word repeating a few times and it
[00:02:07] will be blocked if we locked in you're a
[00:02:09] master at pi you're welcome
[00:02:16] [Applause]

=== MEMORIZING THE ENTIRE CALENDAR! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez3IdqoDZkw

[00:00:00] what's up everyone Nelson dellas here in
[00:00:02] another random memory tips video and in
[00:00:04] this episode we're going to talk about
[00:00:06] how to memorize the yearly calendar
[00:00:09] specifically for 2018 I'm going to show
[00:00:11] you how if someone were to give you any
[00:00:13] date from this year you could tell me
[00:00:15] the day of the week instantly it's super
[00:00:17] simple and it'll be super helpful when
[00:00:19] you're out there in the world you're
[00:00:21] trying to figure out what day this date
[00:00:22] falls on for this year so without
[00:00:24] further Ado let's Dive Right In
[00:00:27] [Music]
[00:00:36] all right first things first I should
[00:00:37] let you know that this process I learned
[00:00:40] this from a record holder in calendar
[00:00:42] calculation his name is yuser Vieira he
[00:00:45] lives in Miami here he's a good friend
[00:00:46] of mine he actually broke the record for
[00:00:49] the most dates calculated in 1 minute I
[00:00:51] think he got 140 dates so this can be
[00:00:54] applied to any year between 1600 and in
[00:00:58] the future the thing is you just need to
[00:00:59] memorize a few codes to keep it simple
[00:01:01] for this video we're just going to do
[00:01:03] 2018 because it's the beginning of the
[00:01:05] year if you want to know what day a
[00:01:07] certain date falls on you'll be able to
[00:01:09] do it really quickly and I'll leave you
[00:01:10] guys even with something for 2019 thanks
[00:01:13] Obama all right so the first number code
[00:01:15] you need to know is basically the answer
[00:01:17] so the answer is going to be a digit
[00:01:19] between zero and six so 0 1 2 3 4 5 or 6
[00:01:23] and what you need to know is that those
[00:01:25] digits represent the day of the week
[00:01:27] zero is going to be Sunday one is going
[00:01:30] to be Monday two Tuesday three Wednesday
[00:01:34] four Thursday five Friday and six
[00:01:36] Saturday so if you get an answer of
[00:01:38] three you know that's a Wednesday if you
[00:01:40] get an answer of five you know that's a
[00:01:42] Friday if you get an answer of zero
[00:01:43] that's a Sunday the next thing you need
[00:01:45] to understand and this is a little
[00:01:46] complicated but not really that
[00:01:48] complicated is how to do modular
[00:01:50] division basically dividing by a
[00:01:53] specific number but only caring about
[00:01:55] the remainder so for example and because
[00:01:57] we're doing days of the week we're going
[00:01:59] to be doing modular division by seven if
[00:02:01] you know you're seven times table and
[00:02:03] you can divide by seven you're good as
[00:02:04] long as you just know the remainder
[00:02:06] let's say 15 7 goes into 15 twice right
[00:02:10] with a remainder of one 15 mod 7 my
[00:02:14] answer is actually one I only care about
[00:02:16] the remainder so as we add up totals
[00:02:19] you're just going to keep on dropping
[00:02:20] out sevens so if my total comes up to 23
[00:02:25] I'm instantly going to say that's two
[00:02:27] because remember 7 goes into 21 three
[00:02:30] times fine but it's a remainder of two
[00:02:32] right so 23 mod 7 is 2 all right next
[00:02:35] thing to remember this is very easy for
[00:02:38] this year 2018 there's a specific year
[00:02:41] code and the code for that is the number
[00:02:44] two it's all you got to remember and
[00:02:46] here's the secret for next year it's
[00:02:48] going to be three if you want to get
[00:02:50] good at doing this for any year in a
[00:02:52] century there is a way to calculate it
[00:02:54] it's easier just to memorize them
[00:02:56] because there actually is a pattern but
[00:02:58] just know that 2018 the code is is two
[00:03:00] 2019 is three the next set of codes you
[00:03:03] have to remember are for the months of
[00:03:05] the year so January through December and
[00:03:07] this is probably where the most
[00:03:08] memorization work comes but I'm going to
[00:03:10] help you come up with little monics to
[00:03:12] remember what they are so January is 5
[00:03:15] we can remember it like imagine January
[00:03:17] is just the coldest month of the year
[00:03:18] and it's 5° outside February and March
[00:03:22] are both one that's an easy one you can
[00:03:25] think of it like February is a short
[00:03:26] month March kind of quickly follows
[00:03:29] after so so they're both just kind of
[00:03:30] like quick months that come back to back
[00:03:33] one and one April is 4 that one's an
[00:03:36] easy one cuz it's the fourth month of
[00:03:38] the year may is 6 the way I like to
[00:03:41] remember it this is so stupid but six
[00:03:43] sounds like sex I think like maybe May
[00:03:47] the month may maybe I'll be lucky and
[00:03:50] have sex six June is the number two I
[00:03:54] think June is like a sunny hot month so
[00:03:57] maybe it's too hot right Sun's just
[00:04:00] beating down it's too too hot July is 4
[00:04:04] that's easy one you can just think of
[00:04:05] July 4th August and that the code is
[00:04:08] zero that's an easy one because whenever
[00:04:10] it's zero you don't have to calculate
[00:04:12] anything so you can kind of think of
[00:04:13] maybe like August uh is kind of like a
[00:04:18] nothing month it's kind of a transition
[00:04:20] after summer before fall school's about
[00:04:23] to start nothing really happens in
[00:04:24] August the next one is September and the
[00:04:27] number for that is three sept makes
[00:04:29] makes me think of like a religious kind
[00:04:32] of building and I just imagine that
[00:04:34] there's three really religious uh
[00:04:38] figures at the top of these seps October
[00:04:41] is five I think of Halloween and when
[00:04:44] you ask trick or treat and you're given
[00:04:47] the chance to grab as much candy as you
[00:04:49] want you use all five of your fingers to
[00:04:52] grab that candy next up is November and
[00:04:54] the number for that is one I like to
[00:04:56] think that November is really the first
[00:04:59] month where really starts to get
[00:05:01] chillier right it's Thanksgiving
[00:05:03] becoming the holidays it's kind of the
[00:05:05] first month where Christmas holiday cold
[00:05:09] season comes around I know it's not the
[00:05:10] first month of winter but it starts to
[00:05:12] feel like winter that's the first month
[00:05:14] where it happens one and finally
[00:05:16] December is also three even think of
[00:05:18] Christmas the three kings whatever comes
[00:05:21] to mind all right so you have everything
[00:05:24] you need to be able to do this
[00:05:25] calculation let's take today which is
[00:05:27] January 28th 2018 you're going to break
[00:05:30] that date into all its codes add them
[00:05:32] all together while modding seven so as
[00:05:35] we keep this tally you can drop out
[00:05:37] sevens as they come January 28th 2018 I
[00:05:42] like to start with the day so 28 and I
[00:05:44] think to myself before I start adding is
[00:05:46] what is that mod 7 28 divid 7 is perfect
[00:05:51] right the remainder is zero then I add
[00:05:53] the code for the month so January
[00:05:56] remember January it's really cold 5°
[00:05:59] outside so our number now is 0 + 5 five
[00:06:04] right I can't mod seven cuz I haven't
[00:06:06] reached a full seven so I'm stuck at
[00:06:07] five right now with my Tally next thing
[00:06:10] is that code I asked you to memorize for
[00:06:11] the year 2018 which was two 5 + 2 is 7
[00:06:16] mod 7 yeah it goes in perfectly with a
[00:06:19] remainder of zero remember zero is
[00:06:21] Sunday so January 28th 2018 is a Sunday
[00:06:25] let's try another example how about July
[00:06:27] 4th 2018 I start with four can I mod
[00:06:31] that by seven not yet cuz it's still
[00:06:32] under seven so I keep the tally of four
[00:06:35] the fourth day and then July I use the
[00:06:37] month code for July which was also four
[00:06:40] right so I have four + 4 that's eight or
[00:06:43] mod seven that's with a remainder of one
[00:06:45] so my Tally is now one and then I add
[00:06:49] the code for 2018 which is two so 1 + 2
[00:06:52] is three and what's three for our days
[00:06:54] of the week that's a Wednesday July 4th
[00:06:57] 2018 is on a Wednesday and actually
[00:06:59] because the code for 2019 is three
[00:07:01] instead of two if you want to know what
[00:07:03] it's going to be next year it's very
[00:07:05] simple obviously you just add a day so
[00:07:07] July 4th 2019 is going to fall on a
[00:07:11] Thursday as long as you know how to do
[00:07:13] that modular division which is a bit
[00:07:15] tricky but the idea is pretty simple
[00:07:17] just take the remainder if you divide by
[00:07:18] seven and if you know all the codes for
[00:07:20] the months you should be able to do this
[00:07:22] really quick for 2018 or 2019 it's a fun
[00:07:25] little thing if somebody's just talking
[00:07:27] like oh you know I have something in 3
[00:07:29] weeks that's gonna be a and then
[00:07:30] suddenly you come out of nowhere and
[00:07:31] you're like that's a Thursday my friend
[00:07:34] like how did you do that well I
[00:07:35] memorized the whole calendar of 2018
[00:07:37] it's a lie you're just really fast at
[00:07:39] calculating something easy but don't
[00:07:41] tell them that that's enough for this
[00:07:42] video thanks for watching I'll be back
[00:07:44] soon with another video for now I'm out

[00:00:10] [Music]
[00:00:16] [Music]
[00:00:54] in Katmandu for a few days then I go
[00:00:58] back up to base camp
[00:01:01] you have no idea
[00:01:03] you haven't had these luxuries of bed a
[00:01:06] shower flat-screen TV for over a month
[00:01:17] [Music]
[00:01:38] [Laughter]
[00:01:44] [Music]
[00:02:06] just made it to camp to face hey we're
[00:02:16] Camp 2 here this is in the dining tent
[00:02:19] luxurious and basically we're gonna go
[00:02:24] up to camp 3 tomorrow I came up with a
[00:02:27] very very very very heavy pack because
[00:02:31] I'm carrying this camera big camera a 3d
[00:02:34] 60 camera part of my sponsor deal but I
[00:02:39] struggled yesterday really bad
[00:02:42] dangerously bad and so if I want to
[00:02:46] summit this thing I don't want to ruin
[00:02:48] my chances and I think taking that
[00:02:50] camera up is gonna ruin my chances I
[00:02:52] didn't think so before but see my
[00:02:54] performance yesterday [ __ ] so no camera
[00:02:59] going up tomorrow summit on the 18th
[00:03:02] yes so let's see face you can see camp
[00:03:07] three over there the rock goes all the
[00:03:10] way there
[00:03:10] South close behind the summit somewhere
[00:03:15] behind there fire someone pushed
[00:03:19] tomorrow feeling tired but good I think
[00:03:22] you'll be okay
[00:03:24] [Music]
[00:03:31] [Music]
[00:03:54] Robert
[00:03:56] [Music]
[00:04:01] [Applause]

[00:04:24] [Music]
[00:04:46] [Music]
[00:04:54] [Music]
[00:05:29] so I came back to camp to bit of chakra
[00:05:35] we're gonna go for the summit actually
[00:05:36] tonight but uh last night for some
[00:05:40] reason actually the past few five days
[00:05:43] that's probably Bush I've been kind of
[00:05:46] weak weaker than I know to myself to be
[00:05:50] first I thought it was a heavy pack I
[00:05:52] was carrying this big camera but I
[00:05:53] dropped that at Camp two and camp three
[00:05:56] to camp three and then to camp for both
[00:05:58] I struggled I did fine comparatively but
[00:06:01] um for me I did bad so I was okay we
[00:06:07] were on oxygen
[00:06:08] Kent for ready to go for the summit and
[00:06:11] in the night I drank some water I hadn't
[00:06:15] drank a lot of water went on my side and
[00:06:17] started coughing a lot but like pieces
[00:06:20] of stuff came out with the cough and not
[00:06:24] just like phlegm I wasn't sick it was
[00:06:25] like pieces of my lung and a couple of
[00:06:28] them were covered in traces of blood so
[00:06:33] I slept through the night and then told
[00:06:37] Phil about it and yeah I mean that's the
[00:06:41] early signs of hape or the starting of
[00:06:44] hape pulmonary edema and what you do is
[00:06:48] you go down take some medicine but go
[00:06:52] down not go up so that's frustrating you
[00:06:57] know I've tried so many years to climb
[00:07:01] this thing and this was my body's way of
[00:07:05] telling me that you're not allowed to
[00:07:08] get up there
[00:07:09] am I disappointed of course
[00:07:12] he put five six years into something
[00:07:15] tons of money effort body change that
[00:07:21] was hard that was this mountain was hard
[00:07:23] to see you know maybe it was just what
[00:07:25] for what else you know that was hard
[00:07:28] [Music]
[00:07:32] today was the day I learned
[00:07:35] how high my body can go I'll hide the
[00:07:37] top of the world is for me
[00:07:42] the other night that covers me black as
[00:07:44] the pit from pole
[00:07:49] I think whatever God there may be for my
[00:07:52] unconquerable soul
[00:07:55] the fell clutch of circumstance I have
[00:07:58] not fired around
[00:08:01] and that the bludgeonings of fate my
[00:08:04] head is bloody but unbowed
[00:08:10] beyond this place of Wrath and tears
[00:08:12] looms but the shadow of the shade yet

=== THE PEG METHOD // RANDOM MEMORY TIPS #015 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2cqtA7b6cM

[00:00:00] what's up everyone Nelson Dellis here in
[00:00:02] another random memory tips video and
[00:00:04] this episode we are going to talk about
[00:00:06] the peg method let's dive right in
[00:00:10] [Laughter]
[00:00:20] okay so how does it work the peg method
[00:00:23] basically like the memory palace
[00:00:24] technique takes some lists that you know
[00:00:28] very well and you attach pictures to it
[00:00:31] with the memory palace the list that we
[00:00:33] already know is essentially your house
[00:00:35] you know the path through your house the
[00:00:37] peg method basically plays on things you
[00:00:40] already know in the same way as a memory
[00:00:42] palace but less spatial so a great
[00:00:44] example and one that most people use is
[00:00:46] the alphabet abcdefg you know that song
[00:00:50] like the back of your head you learned
[00:00:51] that when you were a kid why not use the
[00:00:53] order of the letters as anchors or a
[00:00:56] little path to store your list in order
[00:00:58] so if you're gonna use the alphabet
[00:01:01] route which I recommend when you're
[00:01:03] starting out with this technique you're
[00:01:04] gonna have to come up with a anchor
[00:01:06] image for each letter so just thinking
[00:01:08] of the letter isn't enough come up with
[00:01:10] a word for each letter of the alphabet I
[00:01:12] typically tell people think of the first
[00:01:14] word that comes to mind for each letter
[00:01:16] so a Apple B bat will want you to choose
[00:01:21] a category we could just do animals that
[00:01:24] start with the letters right a could be
[00:01:26] aardvark B could be bat
[00:01:30] see could be cat you just play this
[00:01:33] association game right let's say you
[00:01:35] have a list of 10 things that you need
[00:01:38] to buy 10 random kind of gifts for your
[00:01:40] friends your families brother-sister
[00:01:42] whatever let's go through the alphabet
[00:01:44] up to 10 letters and come up with our
[00:01:46] anchor images all right
[00:01:48] let's write them down aardvark bat cat
[00:01:50] dog elephant fish giraffe television
[00:01:53] feel free to come up with your own those
[00:01:56] are just what came to my mind so here
[00:01:58] are 10 gifts that you randomly have to
[00:02:00] buy people okay so here is our Christmas
[00:02:03] list Furby tennis racket gak
[00:02:07] nerf gun the book titled Game of Thrones
[00:02:11] Burberry perfume chocolates Bitcoin
[00:02:15] scarf a Nintendo switch hell yeah all
[00:02:19] right so we have Furby tennis racket gak
[00:02:20] nerf gun Game of Thrones book Burberry
[00:02:23] perfume chocolates Bitcoin scarf and
[00:02:26] Nintendo switch first things first we
[00:02:31] have an aardvark on that picture of
[00:02:32] aardvark sucking up through his aunt
[00:02:35] eating little hole a Furby getting
[00:02:37] sucked up into his aardvark nostril next
[00:02:40] on our list the animal is a bat B for
[00:02:42] bat and I think our list was a tennis
[00:02:44] racket someone playing tennis across the
[00:02:47] court hitting the crap out of the bat
[00:02:49] see it's a cat third thing on our list
[00:02:52] is gap let's imagine that this cat is
[00:02:54] actually made of gak and if you like
[00:02:57] press it it makes that gak weird sound
[00:02:59] maybe even has that same texture as gap
[00:03:02] all right dog D for dogs the fourth
[00:03:04] thing on our list and we have a nerf gun
[00:03:06] okay so I just picture one of these
[00:03:08] massive nerf guns foam darts right with
[00:03:11] suction cups at the end of it so let's
[00:03:13] picture this dog that's just like
[00:03:14] strapped to the nines like Rambo style
[00:03:17] but with nerf guns dog with nerf gun
[00:03:20] all right we're halfway there elephant
[00:03:22] efj elephant is the fifth thing on our
[00:03:24] list and we're buying someone Game of
[00:03:26] Thrones book this is a little more cop
[00:03:28] just thinking of a book right I think of
[00:03:30] an elephant reading a book but it's
[00:03:32] specifically Game of Thrones maybe he's
[00:03:34] reading a book that has a one-page
[00:03:38] chessboard it's a game and on the other
[00:03:40] page has it thrown right so he's opening
[00:03:43] this book it's like a picture book it's
[00:03:45] got a game and a throne sixth item on
[00:03:48] our list is fish alright s for fish
[00:03:50] right and our next item on our Christmas
[00:03:53] lists is Burberry perfume okay so you
[00:03:55] can just picture perfume bottle we got
[00:03:57] to get that Burberry part of it maybe
[00:03:59] it's filled with berries maybe even
[00:04:01] burned berries maybe you can imagine
[00:04:03] that he's actually using it as a
[00:04:05] repellent against sharks right we
[00:04:07] spraying the stuff as he swims through
[00:04:08] the ocean and no shark or larger fish
[00:04:12] wants it you know next letter is G
[00:04:14] giraffe right seventh item on our list
[00:04:16] and this one's pretty simple is
[00:04:18] chocolates right I would picture that
[00:04:20] this giraffe obviously has spots maybe B
[00:04:22] spots are actually chocolates or eighth
[00:04:25] item on the list were with a hyena now
[00:04:27] we got Bitcoin right do you have Bitcoin
[00:04:29] you know who has Bitcoin this hyena he's
[00:04:32] laughing his way to the bank
[00:04:34] cuz he invested a big point years ago
[00:04:36] millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin
[00:04:38] next one is I for iguana this one's
[00:04:41] pretty simple you got a scarf on the
[00:04:43] list where do you picture iguanas
[00:04:44] typically in the jungle and hot tropical
[00:04:48] environments so let's just make it weird
[00:04:50] and imagine him being a raft in a scarf
[00:04:52] because he's cold and finally 10th item
[00:04:55] on our list is a jellyfish Nintendo
[00:04:57] switch if you don't know what that is
[00:04:58] that's a Nintendo system most recent one
[00:05:01] let's picture this jellyfish with all
[00:05:03] his tentacles right it's just holding a
[00:05:05] Nintendo switch controller or you can
[00:05:07] just picture any Nintendo kind of
[00:05:09] controller
[00:05:10] [Music]
[00:05:28] [Music]
[00:05:51] so there you have it very simple it's
[00:05:54] actually a very very easy thing
[00:05:56] everybody knows the alphabet everybody
[00:05:58] can come up with words from the alphabet
[00:06:00] so that's it you better not forget your
[00:06:02] Christmas list and as a gift to me
[00:06:04] please subscribe please share my channel
[00:06:07] like this video comment if you will
[00:06:10] Merry Christmas Happy Holidays and I
[00:06:13] will see all of you in the next year
[00:06:16] 2018 where I plan to come out with a lot
[00:06:18] more high quality content in terms of
[00:06:21] memory tips and just videos in general

=== HOW TO MEMORIZE LINES INSTANTLY (SERIOUSLY) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8k_rNTDjJM

[00:00:00] - What's up, everyone, Nelson Dellis here
[00:00:01] for another episode of Random Memory Tips,
[00:00:04] and in this video, I'm gonna teach you
[00:00:05] how to memorize any lines of text,
[00:00:08] any lines of poetry really quick.
[00:00:10] It's a really simple,
[00:00:11] and I don't even know how it works,
[00:00:13] technique for memory and
memorizing those kinds of things.
[00:00:16] You gotta see this, let's go.
[00:00:18] (energetic rhythmic music)
[00:00:26] So, I learned this technique
watching another YouTube video.
[00:00:29] It's not something that I came up with
[00:00:31] or had ever heard about until I watched
[00:00:33] Lauren Tothero's video on this.
[00:00:35] I don't know where she got it from either
[00:00:36] or if she came up with it, but I tried it
[00:00:39] and it involves like
zero memory techniques.
[00:00:42] It's just kind of doing this process
[00:00:43] that your brain somehow
gobbles up this information
[00:00:46] and it is able to spew it back out.
[00:00:48] It's insane.
- Wait.
[00:00:50] - I will say that if you do this,
[00:00:51] yes, you'll get the lines
in your heads really fast,
[00:00:53] but you then have to maybe
apply a memory palace technique
[00:00:57] to help kind of solidify it there
[00:00:59] for longer periods of time.
[00:01:00] But if you're on set, if you're
about to deliver something
[00:01:03] and you need to get those
lines right in your head,
[00:01:06] this technique is almost fool-proof.
[00:01:08] I have a goal in mind,
but I think to start
[00:01:11] we could do something very simple
[00:01:12] like this random line from a
random poem called Sasquatch.
[00:01:17] The Sasquatch squats, flowers in hand,
[00:01:20] on an old stump by the riverbed.
[00:01:22] THat's the first two lines.
[00:01:23] You read over that line,
or lines, a couple times
[00:01:26] to kinda get the gist of it in your head.
[00:01:28] Okay, so the Sasquatch
squats, flowers in hand,
[00:01:31] on an old stump by the riverbed.
[00:01:33] Sasquatch squats, flowers in hand,
[00:01:35] on an old stump by the riverbed.
[00:01:36] Then what you do is,
[00:01:38] and do it with a pen on a piece of paper
[00:01:40] just so you get that visual memory,
[00:01:42] is write down the first
letter of each word.
[00:01:45] So, the is just the T,
[00:01:48] S for Sasquatch, and include punctutation
[00:01:51] and capitals if they have capital letters.
[00:01:54] Squats comma flowers in hand comma
[00:02:00] on an old stump
[00:02:03] by the riverbed period.
[00:02:07] This is what I have.
[00:02:08] Doesn't look like much,
[00:02:09] but then what you try to do
is try to read this, right?
[00:02:13] Try to read what it actually is
[00:02:15] just using the first letter of each word.
[00:02:17] And so it may seem a bit impossible,
[00:02:20] but if you think about it
and you remember a little bit
[00:02:22] the visual things that you
saw when you first read it,
[00:02:25] you can kinda put it together.
[00:02:26] And if you can't get it, you
can always kind of look back,
[00:02:29] but you should be able
to get this pretty quick.
[00:02:30] So, the Sasquatch squats, flowers in hand,
[00:02:34] on an old stump
[00:02:35] by the riverbank.
[00:02:37] I think.
[00:02:39] Bed.
[00:02:40] So, then what you do is
once you kinda have that,
[00:02:42] read this over a couple
times in your head.
[00:02:44] The Sasquatch squats, flowers in hand,
[00:02:47] on an old stump by the riverbed.
[00:02:49] The Sasquatch squats, flower
in hand, flowers in hand,
[00:02:53] on an old stump by the riverbed.
[00:02:55] That's it.
[00:02:56] Now, that's not that impressive
[00:02:58] just because that's just two lines,
[00:03:00] so let's try it maybe with something
[00:03:01] a little more complicated like--
[00:03:03] - Nick, I want to explain.
[00:03:05] - What's there to explain?
[00:03:06] - But I just want to say that--
[00:03:07] - Look, I'm not the first
guy who fell in love
[00:03:08] with a girl he met in a restaurant
[00:03:10] who then turned out to be
[00:03:10] the daughter of a kidnapped scientist,
[00:03:12] only to lose her to a childhood lover
[00:03:13] who she'd last seen on a deserted island
[00:03:15] and who turned out, 15 years later,
[00:03:16] to be the leader of
the French Underground.
[00:03:18] - I know it.
[00:03:20] It all sounds like some bad movie.
[00:03:22] - Just to reiterate what
the quote is exactly,
[00:03:24] I'm not the first guy who fell in love
[00:03:26] with woman that he met at a restaurant
[00:03:28] who turned out to be the daughter
of a kidnapped scientists,
[00:03:31] only to lose her to her childhood lover
[00:03:33] who she last saw on a deserted island
[00:03:35] who then turned out, 15 years later,
[00:03:36] to be the leader of
the French Underground.
[00:03:39] Yeah.
[00:03:40] - Well, it's a little confusing.
[00:03:41] - Maybe I'll read it one more time.
[00:03:42] First guy who fell in love with a woman
[00:03:44] that he met at a restaurant
[00:03:45] who turned out to be the daughter
of a kidnapped scientist,
[00:03:47] only to lose her to her childhood lover
[00:03:49] who she last saw on a deserted island
[00:03:51] who then turned out, 15 years later,
[00:03:53] to be the leader of
the French Underground.
[00:03:55] Now, this next step is to
write down all those letters,
[00:03:58] just the first letters,
[00:04:00] and I think it helps if you write it
[00:04:01] in the same format that you're reading it.
[00:04:03] So if something skips the next line,
[00:04:05] you should write it out that way.
[00:04:06] That way you have the visual
memory of it when you read it,
[00:04:09] the visual memory when you write it down,
[00:04:11] and then then you try
to actually remember it
[00:04:14] with all those pieces together,
[00:04:15] you actually have kind of
[00:04:17] an amazing blueprint of it in your head.
[00:04:19] Here it is.
[00:04:21] Yeah, that's a lot of letters, right?
[00:04:23] So, let's try to read it.
[00:04:24] Let me see if I can read it.
[00:04:26] I have it here in case
I need to look over.
[00:04:27] The first few times, just
try to get through it.
[00:04:29] I'm not the first guy who fell in love
[00:04:31] with a woman that he met at a
restaurant who then turned out
[00:04:33] to be the daughter of
a kidnapped scientist,
[00:04:35] only to lose her to her childhood lover
[00:04:37] who she last saw on a deserted island
[00:04:39] who then turned out, 15 years later,
[00:04:41] to be the leader of
the French Underground.
[00:04:43] Alright, let's try this.
(dramatic chord)
[00:04:45] I'm not the first guy who fell in love
[00:04:46] with a woman who he met at a restaurant
[00:04:48] who then turned out to be
[00:04:49] the daughter of a kidnapped scientist,
[00:04:50] only to lose her to her childhood lover
[00:04:52] who she last seen on a deserted island
[00:04:54] who then turned out, 15 years later,
[00:04:55] to be the leader of
the French Underground.
[00:04:57] Boom.
- Yes.
[00:04:59] - Alright, thank you guys.
[00:04:59] That was a short one.
[00:05:01] Pretty easy, not much memory to it,
[00:05:03] but I hope it helps you.
[00:05:04] A lot of people ask me how do I remember
[00:05:05] specific texts really quickly,
[00:05:07] and most of the time I tell them
[00:05:09] just to use a memory palace,
but that takes a process.
[00:05:12] It takes up some time,
[00:05:13] so this is actually a really quick method
[00:05:15] and I think it's fun.
[00:05:16] It's kinda weird how it just gets absorbed
[00:05:18] and anyone can do it,
[00:05:19] so go ahead and try that,
and I hope it helps you guys.
[00:05:22] I'll see you in the next video.
[00:05:23] Make sure to like,
subscribe, all the things.
[00:05:25] I'll see you very shortly.
[00:05:27] Thanks, guys, peace.

=== MY FAVORITE MEMORY TOOLS ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0UlQpMCxG4

[00:00:00] what's up everyone Nelson Dellis here in
[00:00:02] another episode of random memory tips
[00:00:04] and in this video I'm gonna show you
[00:00:06] some of the tools that I use to help me
[00:00:09] memorize to learn them information you
[00:00:11] ready let's go alright so a lot of you
[00:00:29] guys keep messaging me asking me what I
[00:00:31] use to train my memory and then I have
[00:00:34] other people just ask me what do I use
[00:00:35] what are some recommendations for just
[00:00:37] learning things memorizing texts or
[00:00:40] memorizing speeches or facts or whatever
[00:00:43] so I'm gonna talk about both of those
[00:00:45] things
[00:00:45] and have to realize that the difference
[00:00:47] between me and everyday person is that I
[00:00:49] compete for memory competitions yeah so
[00:00:51] my training the tools I use tend to be
[00:00:54] geared towards that not to say that
[00:00:56] that's bad for you if you're just
[00:00:58] generally interested in memory
[00:01:00] improvement I always say that practicing
[00:01:03] your memory as if you're gonna train for
[00:01:04] a competition will help you memorize
[00:01:06] anything else in the future so keep that
[00:01:09] in mind so some of the things I use may
[00:01:11] be very helpful to you alright one of
[00:01:13] the very first important tools that I
[00:01:15] use is a noise cancelling the set of
[00:01:19] headphones put these on now why is that
[00:01:24] useful for me obviously in competitions
[00:01:26] this is great for blocking out
[00:01:28] distractions this is really helpful to
[00:01:30] help me focus and as I mentioned a
[00:01:32] million times before in other videos
[00:01:33] focus is key you can buy these on Amazon
[00:01:36] I use the peltor 105 and it just sounds
[00:01:41] really quiet when you put them on does
[00:01:43] it cancel everything but most of it
[00:01:45] second important tool that I use is a
[00:01:47] timer and I know
[00:01:49] sounds really boring but a lot of the
[00:01:52] tasks I do are time-based and I also
[00:01:55] want to see how much faster my memory
[00:01:57] gets whether it's memorizing cards names
[00:01:59] whatever I want to see my improvement
[00:02:01] via time I keep very detailed notes on
[00:02:04] my performance and time is one of them
[00:02:06] so I use a stack mat timer this is an
[00:02:09] older model I think there's newer ones
[00:02:12] to buy cheap knockoffs from China that
[00:02:16] worked just as well there's even a
[00:02:17] version of it for the iPhone just like
[00:02:20] that great little tool to have just if
[00:02:22] you want to keep track of time so
[00:02:25] there's a few different software suites
[00:02:26] and tools that I've used over the years
[00:02:28] and I'm gonna start with the ones I used
[00:02:30] to use and that I still kind of use from
[00:02:32] time to time that are pretty good and
[00:02:34] then I'll finish with the one that I
[00:02:36] think is the best first one I want to
[00:02:38] talk about is memory aid what I use it
[00:02:40] mainly for is memorizing numbers and
[00:02:42] what's great about it is it's very easy
[00:02:44] to use you can change the time five
[00:02:47] minutes one minute fifteen minutes
[00:02:50] thirty minutes an hour however long you
[00:02:52] want to memorize numbers for and then it
[00:02:53] grades it very nicely some of the cons
[00:02:55] it's kind of outdated software which it
[00:02:57] was updated the cards it's clunky you
[00:03:00] can just use real cards the names the
[00:03:02] database of faces and names is really
[00:03:04] low it's only for PC which drives me
[00:03:07] nuts because I use all Apple products so
[00:03:11] I have an old old computer that's a PC
[00:03:14] laptop that's just garbage but it runs
[00:03:16] that I have it just to run that program
[00:03:18] great tool if you have a PC and you're
[00:03:21] very keen on practicing with numbers
[00:03:23] they can generate the numbers real quick
[00:03:24] and human memorizing numbers in no time
[00:03:26] all right next up is a website called
[00:03:27] memo camp it's very popular in Germany
[00:03:30] and throughout the memory community I
[00:03:32] used to use it obsessively because it
[00:03:34] was the only option out there it's about
[00:03:36] 10 euros a month subscription which is
[00:03:39] fair I primarily use it for memorizing
[00:03:41] names just because their database of
[00:03:44] photos a headshots is quite expensive
[00:03:46] and they have some interesting foreign
[00:03:48] names to practice with so if you want to
[00:03:50] get good practice with international
[00:03:52] names it's perfect there are other
[00:03:54] features but it's translated from German
[00:03:56] into English so some of the text
[00:03:57] actually doesn't translate very well not
[00:04:00] too hard so that you can
[00:04:01] but it's just annoying I know you can
[00:04:03] develop some memory systems with it but
[00:04:05] I've never tried it's not obvious to me
[00:04:07] it was a bit unintuitive even though you
[00:04:09] can do it I just didn't find it useful
[00:04:12] so a great tool if you want to actually
[00:04:13] practice for memory competitions it has
[00:04:16] all the disciplines which is nice can
[00:04:18] set a metronome there's a leaderboard of
[00:04:21] score so you can see how you compare
[00:04:23] with other people online so that's cool
[00:04:25] I don't really use it that much anymore
[00:04:26] just cuz there are other tools this is
[00:04:28] something that got me started way back
[00:04:30] when one of my favorite websites I've
[00:04:32] used it since it was released and I
[00:04:34] still use it to this day is an app
[00:04:35] called memorize it was developed by Edie
[00:04:37] Cooke who's read moonwalking with
[00:04:39] Einstein was one of the main characters
[00:04:41] he's a former memory competitor grand
[00:04:44] master of memory in the UK and so this
[00:04:46] website is basically flashcards on
[00:04:49] steroids in a fun environment so you can
[00:04:52] create an account it's free and people
[00:04:55] have set up the flashcards for you if
[00:04:57] you're interested in learning you know
[00:04:59] Chinese symbols or vocabulary or
[00:05:01] whatever or you can create your own and
[00:05:03] what it does is it keeps track of when
[00:05:06] you last reviewed and what you've gotten
[00:05:08] correct in the past so it's this kind of
[00:05:10] spaced repetition and adaptive learning
[00:05:13] I guess of your memory skills what I
[00:05:16] like most about it is it's fun it's very
[00:05:18] gamified so you go in there it looks
[00:05:21] pretty you're planting seeds and growing
[00:05:23] plants and stuff with your memories of
[00:05:25] things and just hooks you in you really
[00:05:28] want to play it which is good when
[00:05:29] you're learning stuff I've used it
[00:05:31] mostly for language and I think that's
[00:05:33] kind of where they're they're niches for
[00:05:36] Chinese characters for you know the top
[00:05:39] thousand words in a target language that
[00:05:41] you want to learn is really good
[00:05:42] and they have great sets of those words
[00:05:45] that you can just import and start
[00:05:47] learning them another habit I've
[00:05:49] mentioned before I want to throw in
[00:05:50] there is Anki it's something I've used
[00:05:52] here and there for learning languages as
[00:05:55] well some consider it to be the
[00:05:57] flashcard tool to use for me it's not
[00:06:01] the most user-friendly app I've had
[00:06:04] struggles with it where it was just
[00:06:06] annoying to use on my compete
[00:06:08] and my phone and I just ended up
[00:06:09] dropping it so it lost me along the way
[00:06:12] but I've used it for certain things
[00:06:13] memorizing a thousand words in Italian
[00:06:15] for example was very useful so for those
[00:06:18] of you that are looking for a really
[00:06:19] good flashcard learning app Anki would
[00:06:23] be one of the ones I would recommend
[00:06:24] last but not least this is my favorite
[00:06:26] and it has to be my favorite because
[00:06:28] this app that I helped develop and it's
[00:06:31] art of memory I'm sure you may have
[00:06:33] heard of it if you're a follower of me
[00:06:35] but I'm going to go into kind of the
[00:06:36] specifics of what it can do and what it
[00:06:38] will be able to do it started out as a
[00:06:41] form great form called memo technics
[00:06:43] where anybody could post questions and
[00:06:46] chat with other memory enthusiasts and
[00:06:48] it's still there you can still do that
[00:06:49] to great resource that's kind of where I
[00:06:51] started when I was looking for ideas or
[00:06:53] helping other people and I still kind of
[00:06:55] peruse that form to see if there's
[00:06:57] anything that I can chime in on or learn
[00:06:59] myself we started it out as a
[00:07:01] Kickstarter to raise money to start and
[00:07:04] develop this thing fully our memory will
[00:07:06] have tutorials so basically teaching you
[00:07:08] how to improve your memory step by step
[00:07:11] starting from the very basics all the
[00:07:13] way to the very complex stuff next
[00:07:15] you'll have tools to build out your
[00:07:17] systems as you get deeper into memory
[00:07:20] and mnemonics you'll realize that for a
[00:07:21] lot of the things that we encounter in
[00:07:23] our daily lives you want to maybe create
[00:07:25] some systems things that are pre learned
[00:07:28] so that it'll help your memorization
[00:07:29] later we have tools that help you come
[00:07:32] up with these systems and similar to
[00:07:33] memorize or any of these flashcards
[00:07:35] training apps it will remind you when
[00:07:37] you need to review them how fresh they
[00:07:40] are if you've forgotten it recently
[00:07:41] things like that what's even cooler is
[00:07:42] that you can share your systems and it
[00:07:45] can actually incorporate other people's
[00:07:47] systems and we have a rating system so
[00:07:49] the general community likes this one
[00:07:52] system for whatever it is you can bring
[00:07:55] it into your systems library and learn
[00:07:58] that system or alter it however you want
[00:08:00] I think this is going to be one of the
[00:08:01] coolest features it has is creating your
[00:08:04] own journeys your own memory palaces so
[00:08:06] you'll be able to have pictures that you
[00:08:08] can import
[00:08:10] and create a path through that picture
[00:08:13] and attach the images of the things you
[00:08:15] want to memorize so think of it as an
[00:08:18] interactive live memory palace instead
[00:08:21] of coming up with it in your head you
[00:08:22] can actually design it in front of your
[00:08:25] eyes I know the big part of it is coming
[00:08:26] up with in your mind but a lot of people
[00:08:28] need to see it before they actually
[00:08:29] memorize it so you can create your own
[00:08:31] journeys with our software there's a lot
[00:08:33] of other features at art a memory I
[00:08:35] encourage you to check it out our memory
[00:08:36] comm we also have a competition built
[00:08:39] under the system called memory league
[00:08:41] and you can check out the memory league
[00:08:43] software as well at I'm really calm it's
[00:08:46] a great place for you to compete and
[00:08:47] challenge your memory against other
[00:08:49] memory and athletes our rating in a
[00:08:51] ranking system and we do competitions
[00:08:52] around the world part of memory is my
[00:08:54] favorite tool I use it all those cool
[00:08:56] features aren't quite entirely available
[00:08:58] just yet a lot of it is under beta and
[00:09:01] the Kickstarter backers that we had are
[00:09:04] the first people to get those but you
[00:09:05] can pre-order and most of those features
[00:09:08] are up by the end of the year early next
[00:09:10] year so make sure you get your hands on
[00:09:12] it at least check it out it's awesome I
[00:09:14] love it just so that's it guys I hope
[00:09:16] that was helpful I get so many questions
[00:09:18] about what the tools I use and what
[00:09:19] tools I recommend so that is my short
[00:09:22] list right there it's pretty much that I
[00:09:24] don't really use anything else other
[00:09:26] than a pen and paper if anyone else were
[00:09:29] to ask me I would recommend the same
[00:09:30] ones so go check them out I'll put all
[00:09:33] of the information for everything that I

=== 5 TIPS FOR CREATING MEMORY PALACES ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1x9IaMTpyw

[00:00:05] what's up welcome to another random
[00:00:08] memory tips video I'm gonna give you
[00:00:10] five tips on how to use how to build
[00:00:13] your memory palaces your journeys so you
[00:00:17] can store the things that I've been
[00:00:18] teaching you and memorize them forever
[00:00:20] basically five tips to get your memory
[00:00:23] palace game going you ready alright so
[00:00:35] the first thing most people ask me is
[00:00:36] where do I start how do I build my first
[00:00:39] memory palace
[00:00:40] how many palaces do I use what do they
[00:00:43] look like
[00:00:44] what should I try to make into a memory
[00:00:46] palace does it have to be real does it
[00:00:48] have to be imaginary all these questions
[00:00:50] so hopefully my five tips will cover
[00:00:52] those let's start with the first one the
[00:00:54] first tip I have is some people just get
[00:00:56] you started for those who have never
[00:00:57] built a memory palace before this is an
[00:00:59] instruction so that you know where to
[00:01:01] start and my tip is choose five places
[00:01:04] ten locations each basically think of
[00:01:07] five places you've lived places that
[00:01:10] you've interacted with now I'm not
[00:01:13] talking about one specific location in a
[00:01:16] room I'm talking about a place that has
[00:01:19] many locations that makes any sense so
[00:01:21] your house right has many rooms as many
[00:01:23] corners many pieces of furniture or your
[00:01:26] office what else your high school things
[00:01:30] like that so choose five places and to
[00:01:33] get started I would recommend choosing
[00:01:34] five things that you're in frequent
[00:01:36] contact with so things that in the
[00:01:39] present you go to a lot that you don't
[00:01:41] even need to think about you know them
[00:01:43] very well your house your apartment
[00:01:45] maybe your parents or your significant
[00:01:48] others house or apartment your office
[00:01:50] your favorite movie theater whatever
[00:01:52] five places and
[00:01:54] ten locations on each so remember a
[00:01:56] memory palace is a space that you use to
[00:02:00] navigate through mentally so you need to
[00:02:02] have a start and a beginning so when I
[00:02:04] say ten locations I'm talking about the
[00:02:06] first location being where you start and
[00:02:08] the tenth location being where you end
[00:02:10] and of course there's got to be points
[00:02:13] in the middle so you have ten distinct
[00:02:15] points along your path now these ten
[00:02:18] locations need to be in some type of
[00:02:20] order order you want to choose is the
[00:02:22] way you would walk in it naturally a
[00:02:23] common example I give is use your house
[00:02:25] start at the front door right that seems
[00:02:28] like a very easy first place to start at
[00:02:31] and then you want to end maybe in your
[00:02:33] bed something like that so between the
[00:02:37] first location the door and the last bed
[00:02:39] you want to have enough so that you have
[00:02:41] ten total locations between them a
[00:02:44] location or an anchor point I like to
[00:02:46] call is some thing or area it's hard to
[00:02:50] define I don't want to give any
[00:02:51] definition because you all have to be
[00:02:53] stuck to it for me sometimes it's the
[00:02:55] corner of a room it's the wall in a room
[00:02:59] it's a painting it's a garbage can it's
[00:03:01] really anything that I decide is gonna
[00:03:04] be a fixed point along my route and the
[00:03:07] order needs to make sense something that
[00:03:08] makes sense in terms of how you would
[00:03:10] navigate through it you don't want to
[00:03:12] start at your front door then jump to
[00:03:13] the bedroom then jump to the kitchen
[00:03:15] because you're never gonna remember that
[00:03:17] the goal is to make it easy to remember
[00:03:19] so you want to make them in some kind of
[00:03:21] obvious order tip number two write them
[00:03:24] all down a lot of people ask me do you
[00:03:26] memorize these you just sit down close
[00:03:28] your eyes and think of them and then
[00:03:29] hope that they stay yes of course I
[00:03:31] think about them first I try to
[00:03:33] visualize them but at some point I will
[00:03:35] write them down whether it's in a
[00:03:37] document on my computer or whether it's
[00:03:39] on paper in a book I try to keep it
[00:03:42] somewhere file so it is somewhere
[00:03:45] written down and in case I forget it I
[00:03:48] don't use it for a long time I always
[00:03:50] have it somewhere written down a great
[00:03:52] example is I memorize 10,000 digits of
[00:03:55] pi I needed two thousand locations to
[00:03:58] put all those digits so to keep track of
[00:04:00] two thousand locations you know my
[00:04:02] memory palaces were sprawling
[00:04:04] over cities and things like that so I
[00:04:06] had to write those down because yeah
[00:04:09] sure I knew the path that I took but the
[00:04:11] specific anchor points that I stopped at
[00:04:13] the locations that's the thing that you
[00:04:15] could forget if you have a lot of them
[00:04:17] to the number three don't memorize them
[00:04:20] this is not an extra memory task the
[00:04:23] reason it works is because you've
[00:04:24] already memorized those paths they're
[00:04:27] common to you you know them very well
[00:04:29] they're places you've been a lot they're
[00:04:31] places that you walk through almost
[00:04:33] every day or data at some point in your
[00:04:35] life so that it's easy for you to
[00:04:37] visualize it and know it if it's
[00:04:40] something you have to think about and to
[00:04:41] try and recall from memory it's not a
[00:04:44] good memory palace so choose the ones
[00:04:46] that you don't have to memorize the ones
[00:04:48] that are instinctive tip number four the
[00:04:50] best kinds of memory palaces are the
[00:04:53] ones that are meaningful to you I can't
[00:04:57] tell you what's meaningful I can suggest
[00:04:58] using your house your apartment whatever
[00:05:01] but ultimately it's got to be a place
[00:05:02] that means something to you that has
[00:05:04] some attachment to you whether it's
[00:05:06] emotionally a place that you've been to
[00:05:09] and it means something or you just spend
[00:05:11] so much time there a lot of people I've
[00:05:13] seen them draw boxes on a piece of paper
[00:05:16] and a number of parts of the room one
[00:05:18] two three four five six seven eight nine
[00:05:19] ten and that's their memory palace and I
[00:05:22] look at that in horror because it is the
[00:05:24] most unmemorable memory palace you'll
[00:05:27] ever encounter how are you supposed to
[00:05:28] remember one corner of the room from the
[00:05:30] other and what if you're going to do
[00:05:32] multiple things you need to memorize
[00:05:33] you're just gonna draw boxes all day
[00:05:34] long
[00:05:35] I don't think so come up with something
[00:05:37] that is meaningful meaningful is
[00:05:39] memorable and finally tip number five it
[00:05:43] doesn't have to be a home or a building
[00:05:46] it can be an outdoor space it can walk
[00:05:50] through a park it can be on the water
[00:05:54] whatever it doesn't have to be contained
[00:05:56] inside some wall structure okay I know
[00:06:00] memory palace sounds like you got to
[00:06:02] have some type of Palace type of thing
[00:06:04] but that's not the case I've seen people
[00:06:06] use all sorts of things with great
[00:06:08] success
[00:06:09] and on top of that be creative maybe you
[00:06:11] play a lot of video games maybe you
[00:06:14] watch a lot of movies maybe you read a
[00:06:16] lot of books so what you can do is take
[00:06:18] those places or places from those books
[00:06:21] maybe know them very well
[00:06:22] maybe you play these online fantasy
[00:06:24] games that have these huge sprawling
[00:06:25] Maps use those maps as your memory toss
[00:06:28] if you know them very well I can think
[00:06:30] of some of the n64 games I used to play
[00:06:32] in middle school I remember the
[00:06:34] Goldeneye Maps
[00:06:35] I remember the Mario 64 maps I could use
[00:06:38] those those are meaningful to me they're
[00:06:40] my childhood you know so be creative and
[00:06:42] don't be stuck with just using a
[00:06:44] building you can also use movies movies
[00:06:48] scene by scene if you know all the
[00:06:50] scenes in order that's a path through a
[00:06:52] space not a typical physical space but
[00:06:55] it is a space nonetheless and it is a
[00:06:58] series of locations a series of scenes
[00:07:00] if you will all right thanks guys for
[00:07:02] watching this was a short quick video
[00:07:04] just to get you started on using those
[00:07:06] memory palaces that I always talk about
[00:07:07] in upcoming videos I'll be talking about
[00:07:10] how to memorize some specific things so

=== Ace of Diamonds // Memory Athlete Documentary (2013) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sl1FGNMDp4

[00:00:03] eight seven one one seven six we often
[00:00:10] talk about people with great memories as
[00:00:12] though it were some sort of an innate
[00:00:13] gift but that is not the case two six
[00:00:17] four seven nine great memories are
[00:00:21] learned
[00:00:22] queen of diamonds five of diamonds ace
[00:00:24] of spades Jack of Clubs King of Diamonds
[00:00:26] here we are almost there Queen of Hearts
[00:00:29] three o'clock ten of spades two hearts
[00:00:32] seven of spades
[00:00:34] four clubs and wait five spades
[00:00:37] I've never had a good memory ever I'd
[00:00:41] always struggled to memorize things and
[00:00:43] hear that these people were and the
[00:00:45] competition saying that they didn't have
[00:00:47] a good memory and all they did was learn
[00:00:49] techniques and train it so I was very
[00:00:51] interested in I started learning the
[00:00:53] techniques what would really changed
[00:00:55] everything was that summer of 2009 my
[00:00:58] grandmother passed away and she had been
[00:01:00] suffering from Alzheimer's disease for a
[00:01:02] while even in the last time I saw her I
[00:01:08] remember us eating dinner whose me her
[00:01:12] and my grandfather and she was asking
[00:01:15] where I was it was only until that
[00:01:25] moment that I kind of was like whoa that
[00:01:28] was I didn't know that that disease
[00:01:30] would eventually kill her it made me
[00:01:32] kind of worried about myself and if that
[00:01:34] was a hereditary thing or what if I end
[00:01:37] up like that is what can I do is there
[00:01:39] anything I can do so I started to
[00:01:41] obsessively train and really try to
[00:01:44] build a workout for my mind it was kind
[00:01:47] of like this superpower that I was
[00:01:49] unleashing
[00:02:00] ten of diamonds Queen of Hearts
[00:02:04] six of Spades five of spades jack of
[00:02:08] spades ace of clubs six of diamonds semi
[00:02:11] spades Nelson Dellis is the 2011 winner
[00:02:18] of the USA memory championship where he
[00:02:21] also wrote the u.s. record for
[00:02:23] memorizing numbers and playing cards and
[00:02:26] then in 2012 I won all the events set
[00:02:30] one new record I hate to say it but it
[00:02:32] was easy it felt easy to win I started I
[00:02:34] wanted to do something more where I
[00:02:36] would try to reach more people and try
[00:02:38] to raise awareness and funds for
[00:02:40] Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's
[00:02:42] research so I decided to start a charity
[00:02:45] nonprofit called
[00:02:47] and I call it climb from memory I
[00:02:49] thought that pairing memory with another
[00:02:52] passion of mine which is mountain
[00:02:53] climbing would be kind of an interesting
[00:02:55] cool something that people would latch
[00:02:57] on to endeavor that's I think the first
[00:03:00] step just to making it becomes something
[00:03:03] that's not underfunded just to get
[00:03:06] people to know about it and I think
[00:03:09] bringing it to the top of the world or
[00:03:11] to these really interesting places that
[00:03:13] people can love are drawn to is a cool
[00:03:16] way to do that
[00:03:23] [Music]
[00:03:30] you put the time in and you kind of
[00:03:32] stick through the the shitty moments and
[00:03:35] uncomfortable times that you'll get to
[00:03:39] the top and you'll reap the rewards you
[00:03:42] know and I think that's where I really
[00:03:44] learned that on mountains
[00:03:46] [Music]
[00:03:54] I took my mask away and if it because it
[00:03:58] was there's a lot of saliva in there
[00:03:59] when you're breathing through it it
[00:04:01] froze and I was drinking water or
[00:04:03] whatever so when I started to climb
[00:04:05] again I put it back on it was sticking
[00:04:07] to my face I couldn't breathe with it so
[00:04:10] I panicked and in the panic I just kind
[00:04:12] of moved my mask away and started just
[00:04:15] breathing like that and the Sherpa that
[00:04:17] was climbing with me said you know it's
[00:04:20] just a few more hours to the tops right
[00:04:22] there and I was just not responding
[00:04:28] there was one section where the Rope
[00:04:30] actually veered off this steep slope
[00:04:32] there was a dead body that had fallen a
[00:04:35] little bit and had dragged it down but
[00:04:38] the scary thing wasn't it was a guy who
[00:04:40] had gone out the night before and he had
[00:04:45] gotten cerebral edema which is when your
[00:04:47] brain swells and you you go crazy and he
[00:04:51] had taken off all his warm clothes and
[00:04:53] he was in his just base layers kind of
[00:04:56] crookedly frozen upwards at that time
[00:04:59] you know I I just had this problem and
[00:05:01] I'm thinking a million things and you
[00:05:03] see alive dead dead body the fresh dead
[00:05:06] body from the night before and it just
[00:05:07] kind of makes your head spin I had
[00:05:11] toiled
[00:05:12] between the two decisions for an hour
[00:05:14] and I think the one thing that probably
[00:05:17] saved me is that I had these strong
[00:05:21] memories of people back home at moments
[00:05:24] and I realized I didn't want to lose
[00:05:26] that
[00:05:28] [Music]
[00:05:39] [Music]
[00:05:42] what's next is I need to try and win my
[00:05:45] third US Championship compete in the
[00:05:47] World Championship see how well I do and
[00:05:49] then try Everest one more time if I
[00:05:54] spend a lot of time on our goal and I
[00:05:57] don't get it and I fall short of it I'm
[00:05:59] gonna try hard as to get it back
[00:06:03] and they say working your brain there
[00:06:07] are reports right that's where our brain
[00:06:09] can lead yeah exactly it's not been
[00:06:15] proven but people say that that has
[00:06:17] helped and if it were to happen to me at
[00:06:20] least I know that I have ways of
[00:06:23] remembering things if you know I
[00:06:25] realized that I'm starting to forget
[00:06:26] things more easily the hardest part is
[00:06:31] is everybody around the person with
[00:06:34] Alzheimer's the family and friends you
[00:06:37] know basically you're deteriorating you
[00:06:39] need people to help you and those people
[00:06:42] are gonna be your loved ones you know
[00:06:43] which you're kind of outcasting by the
[00:06:47] fact that you don't remember them
[00:06:58] I feel like it's an epidemic but people
[00:07:03] don't really see it as something you
[00:07:06] know it doesn't feel like this tangible
[00:07:07] disease but it's very damaging and
[00:07:10] damages you know family relationships
[00:07:12] and ties and it eventually will help
[00:07:15] make you forget how to function properly
[00:07:18] [Music]
[00:07:25] being fits and improving circulation and
[00:07:29] blood flow to the brain are things that
[00:07:31] help improve memory you're given one
[00:07:37] life with just one body in one mind you
[00:07:41] know you've got to take care of it
[00:07:43] people are aware of that for their
[00:07:45] bodies it seems people know you should
[00:07:48] eat right and whatever and be fit but
[00:07:51] not many people think like that about
[00:07:53] their mind it's equally as important you
[00:07:55] know one doesn't run without the other
[00:07:59] one actually make these pictures in your
[00:08:02] mind as weird over-the-top bizarre
[00:08:06] gruesome sexual sometimes those are
[00:08:09] really the best things those we memorize
[00:08:11] that better just the natural thing that
[00:08:14] we prefer more I see people and I see
[00:08:17] actions and objects flying around and
[00:08:19] doing all sorts of silly things
[00:08:21] 7:5 is my grandfather and 0/3 is Jack
[00:08:24] Black and Jack Black's action I think of
[00:08:28] him in that movie nacho libre rings
[00:08:31] Ressler so I think of my grandfather
[00:08:34] wrestling and he's like rolling around
[00:08:36] on the floor
[00:08:37] that's George Bush 72 the ex-president
[00:08:41] 74 is Gerard Depardieu though as a
[00:08:45] musketeer so he's actually a sword
[00:08:47] fighting and so I pictured George Bush
[00:08:49] sword fighting you know and he's wearing
[00:08:51] his presidential attire and he's got a
[00:08:53] fencing sword and then to recall it all
[00:08:56] I'm doing is just walking mentally
[00:08:57] through that place and seeing the images
[00:08:59] that I stuck there I can't have the
[00:09:01] system where letters and numbers are
[00:09:03] interchangeable addy is a four this is a
[00:09:06] fourth letter of the alphabet so when I
[00:09:08] see six of diamonds I'm really seeing
[00:09:09] like a 64
[00:09:11] and then that makes me think of Nintendo
[00:09:13] 64's makes me think of my brother that
[00:09:15] sounds like a lot of work but it's it's
[00:09:17] at the point where I've learned it and
[00:09:19] now six of diamonds is my brother no
[00:09:22] translation needed I just melon like you
[00:09:24] know and you see the work dog what that
[00:09:27] is 66 is Satan my pictures saying with
[00:09:32] double D's and the last letters are om I
[00:09:36] so I'm gonna be like oh my god
[00:09:38] same as double D's and he's driving a
[00:09:42] pimped-out BMW ylu maybe I'm looking at
[00:09:45] him I'm saying why there's such a loser
[00:09:47] right why are you driving this car why
[00:09:50] loser Lu it's a high spell but it sounds
[00:09:54] like it loser
[00:09:55] so Jason my friend Jason driving the
[00:09:57] stupid truck for him why are you driving
[00:10:00] this truck hfu I think of high you
[00:10:05] so maybe there's a baby in the back seat
[00:10:09] here
[00:10:10] he's really cute so I'm just saying hi
[00:10:14]  you 0 9 0 x PX p 3 1 2 GD 3 4 6 j
[00:10:24] GH right the Cooper playing hockey with
[00:10:27] that Ghost d66 Oh am i I'm saying oh my
[00:10:32] god the flatbed we had God on the back
[00:10:34] right which was 7 2 3
[00:10:36] it was j pw at one point i decided that
[00:10:40] each card would be a specific person
[00:10:42] with a specific action a specific object
[00:10:46] edward scissorhands
[00:10:47] jesus another ex-girlfriend summer my
[00:10:52] dad would i'll first shoes out of
[00:10:55] location in my head so we go to the
[00:10:57] first place which is the bedroom and
[00:10:58] just look at the first three cards so
[00:11:00] the first three cards would be two
[00:11:02] spades two diamonds and the King of
[00:11:05] Hearts so two of spades is Britney
[00:11:07] Spears I take the first card and use it
[00:11:09] as a person the second card is an action
[00:11:12] so it's actually Kobe Bryant but his
[00:11:14] action is dribbling a basketball and
[00:11:18] then I use a third card it's my dad but
[00:11:21] his object is a piece of paper just cuz
[00:11:24] he's always signing documents right so I
[00:11:26] make a little story of Britney Spears
[00:11:29] dribbling a piece of paper I picture
[00:11:31] that happening in in my bedroom
[00:11:34] there's Britney Spears all sexy oiled up
[00:11:37] and she's dribbling a piece of paper
[00:11:39] that's not even possible but you can
[00:11:41] picture that this is bizarre so then
[00:11:45] once I've done this for the rest of the
[00:11:46] deck I just go back to where I started
[00:11:48] which was in my bedroom right and then I
[00:11:52] picture of Britney Spears right she was
[00:11:54] in there and she was dribbling that
[00:11:56] piece of paper and then we go into the
[00:11:58] next room it was my mom putting lipstick
[00:12:00] on her hand right it's these three and
[00:12:03] then you have my dog on the computer
[00:12:05] tapping it with a sword then you go to
[00:12:08] the TV room it's a 6-3 P oh I'm drinking
[00:12:11] a wand on the balcony as a sniper
[00:12:13] punching a dick Eric Clapton's spinning
[00:12:17] and dancing in the other room and then
[00:12:19] Batman running around a frog and then in
[00:12:21] the
[00:12:21] dining room with Mario golfing
[00:12:24] pizza slice
[00:12:28] [Music]
[00:12:56] I won the cards event I won the numbers
[00:13:10] event I won the names event poetry I got
[00:13:13] I think third place or second place so I
[00:13:15] was in to the afternoon round no problem
[00:13:21] the final event is on stage there's
[00:13:25] three competitors left and you're given
[00:13:28] a two decks of cards to memorize in five
[00:13:31] minutes one by one the three competitors
[00:13:33] recite the two decks in order it's like
[00:13:43] the thing I practiced the most I could
[00:13:44] do three decks of cards right in five
[00:13:46] minutes that's what I was practicing
[00:13:48] even so it's easy for me I do it every
[00:13:50] day I continued with me and Bram Kohli
[00:13:58] was the winner in 2005 I was there I was
[00:14:01] like oh I'm we're just going to recite
[00:14:02] the two decks nine of Hearts Hey the
[00:14:10] club's jackpot - of states
[00:14:31] I lost like a bit of focus for a second
[00:14:43] and in my mind I set a card that had
[00:14:47] already just come out and I knew
[00:14:50] instantly it was like one of these
[00:14:51] things where as I said it I knew my mind
[00:14:55] was like don't say that way saying that
[00:15:00] I'm so stupid you know like I had it all
[00:15:03] and just a second I just kind of let it
[00:15:06] go so to win the title of the world
[00:15:15] championships it's it's tough Johannes
[00:15:19] mallow he's a German
[00:15:21] I think you won two years ago there's
[00:15:24] another guy Simon Reinhardt
[00:15:25] another German who's equally as good or
[00:15:28] as Conrad another German and a British
[00:15:31] guy named Ben prin more most of them are
[00:15:34] pretty consistent through what they do
[00:15:35] but you never know I mean you're
[00:15:38] memorizing really fast a lot of
[00:15:40] information it's easy to make a mistake
[00:15:43] sometimes a lot of when I saw what you
[00:15:47] did because I'm also passionate about
[00:15:49] mountains I discover that mine is much
[00:15:53] much stronger than the physical than the
[00:16:00] body
[00:16:06] it's amazing that last year I was
[00:16:08] risking on the Alps my life and Vizier I
[00:16:12] was a risk I was risking to forget the
[00:16:17] card extreme experience and adrenaline
[00:16:26] experience but you can live in memory
[00:16:29] Sports is a different kind of stuff yeah
[00:16:33] if you combine the two things I think
[00:16:35] it's interesting amazing you have two to
[00:16:40] two sides physical and mind and when you
[00:16:47] add also the spiritual side yeah you are
[00:16:51] I think of pleasure but I decided to go
[00:16:57] from the north side rather than the
[00:16:59] south I went in south side through Nepal
[00:17:01] first time and now this was going to be
[00:17:03] north side through Tibet so it's
[00:17:05] basically kind of like climbing a
[00:17:07] totally different mountain to get from
[00:17:09] base camp to advanced base camp it was a
[00:17:10] 17 kilometer and the wind and the cold
[00:17:15] it was just brutal side of the
[00:17:18] mountain
[00:17:31] [Music]
[00:17:44] so I think we're gonna start with names
[00:17:46] and faces which is you get a bunch of
[00:17:50] faces very international and you gotta
[00:17:53] memorize as many names first and last as
[00:17:55] you can in 15 minutes then it's binary
[00:17:58] numbers so you have 30 minutes to
[00:17:59] memorize as many ones and zeros as you
[00:18:01] can and the final one is our numbers one
[00:18:06] whole hour to memorize digits the health
[00:18:09] of welfare code in binary which is 4140
[00:18:12] digits and in our cards 28 packs I
[00:18:16] talked about memory techniques but I
[00:18:18] thought it was a load of rubbish that
[00:18:19] someone had made up to sell books you
[00:18:21] know so I didn't believe a word of it
[00:18:22] I went along to the competition because
[00:18:24] it had nothing better to do that couple
[00:18:26] of days and I've been hooked ever since
[00:18:28] [Music]
[00:18:54] our forecasts that we got from some
[00:18:58] weather services and the states were
[00:19:00] just so off get the advanced base camp
[00:19:11] and then it's like ah let's wait a day
[00:19:13] it's not looking missed forecast shifted
[00:19:15] back we wait another day same thing
[00:19:18] we were just getting nuts we're going
[00:19:20] crazy dreaming weird things and feel
[00:19:23] like you're loosing it's just it's it
[00:19:25] puts you in a right state second day a
[00:19:41] little more fun we do abstract images so
[00:19:46] they give you these blobs with different
[00:19:49] patterns on them and you have to
[00:19:50] remember to order and then we have
[00:19:53] historic dates which is really cool give
[00:19:55] a page filled with dates and then an
[00:19:58] event that happened that day I get five
[00:20:05] minutes of memorize and many digits as
[00:20:07] possible and then 15 minutes to recall
[00:20:12] last one of that day is that our cards
[00:20:15] so one hour to memorize as many packs in
[00:20:19] order as possible on the mountain I
[00:20:29] actually feel like my memory is better
[00:20:31] and I would keep track of my scores and
[00:20:34] how they varied at altitude and the
[00:20:37] amazing thing was that my scores
[00:20:40] improved he's the person the action
[00:20:45] object you could have a location
[00:20:48] associated with that last object the
[00:20:50] next if it's you her her him that that
[00:20:55] said go to that location that locate
[00:20:58] that object splits off and then the real
[00:21:02] question is why do people practice with
[00:21:07] numbers and words and shapes and cards
[00:21:11] but it's the same as going into a
[00:21:13] physical gymnasium if you're in a gym
[00:21:17] and you're doing a bicycle or you're
[00:21:20] doing a treadmill or they're doing a
[00:21:23] rowing machine then you're doing a half
[00:21:25] an hour you know people don't walk into
[00:21:27] the gym and say what's the matter with
[00:21:29] you that's stupid
[00:21:31] you've been on that rowing machine for
[00:21:33] 30 minutes and you haven't gone anywhere
[00:21:35] and you've been on the bicycle machine
[00:21:37] and you're pedaling away and you're
[00:21:39] still in the same place and you're
[00:21:41] running on the treadmill and you're
[00:21:42] still there
[00:21:43] what a waste of time not always the time
[00:21:45] is it they're in the same place
[00:21:46] exercising and your entire body is
[00:21:50] fitter same with exercising your brain
[00:21:52] when you are memorizing numbers with
[00:21:55] images and you are memorizing cards and
[00:21:59] stories then sitting there as you play
[00:22:05] in your gymnasium your brain is getting
[00:22:08] more powerful really good reason to play
[00:22:11] in the gymnasium of your mind I've
[00:22:13] become a warrior of the Miami
[00:22:21] we spend an extra night that we didn't
[00:22:24] anticipate at camp - which is bad I
[00:22:26] wasn't even allowed to use myself with
[00:22:28] an oxygen because we didn't have enough
[00:22:51] [Applause]
[00:22:57] [Music]
[00:23:03] [Applause]
[00:23:10] my dream for Nelson is that he comes
[00:23:13] close to winning and just from his score
[00:23:16] to keep a steam proof stuff then this is
[00:23:19] because of police or it's like it's like
[00:23:22] every live in Georgia Michael Jordan and
[00:23:24] your basketball team you know for other
[00:23:27] four other kindergarteners if this they
[00:23:30] died no pressure on No
[00:23:43] they'll give you a list of random words
[00:23:45] in your language of preference and 15
[00:23:48] minutes to memorize 30 minutes recall
[00:23:50] then spoken numbers is pretty cool it's
[00:23:53] memorizing numbers but it's spoken one
[00:23:55] digit per second you get graded on where
[00:23:57] up until where you make your first
[00:23:59] mistake one one seven six eight one
[00:24:05] three three eight two six four seven
[00:24:12] nine four one six eight eight seven one
[00:24:22] one
[00:24:35] [Music]
[00:24:46] I was kind of battling with a Norwegian
[00:24:48] guy Ola it was kind of going to be
[00:24:50] decided by speed cards at the end which
[00:24:53] is the final event memorize a deck of
[00:24:55] cards as fast as possible and it was
[00:24:58] really the most tense
[00:25:01] part of the competition
[00:25:21] using ready go
[00:25:41] [Music]
[00:25:59] to that I switched yeah I didn't get it
[00:26:01] I was close I actually had it correct
[00:26:05] and there were two sections that I
[00:26:07] wasn't sure about the order of two cards
[00:26:08] yes and when I was just reviewing it one
[00:26:10] last time I said no let me switch them
[00:26:12] back and they were both actually the
[00:26:21] wind just suddenly would just like blast
[00:26:23] right right through all my gear and I
[00:26:27] needed immediately to open my bag and
[00:26:30] get my big down myths and looking ahead
[00:26:36] at the first step you see the line you
[00:26:38] know people are slow I knew that I
[00:26:41] wouldn't be able to generate enough body
[00:26:43] heat to one of these guys up I had
[00:26:52] points where I'd rap and I didn't even
[00:26:54] really know if I was gripping the rope
[00:26:57] correctly stepping over dead bodies and
[00:26:59] stuff from past seasons and in the dark
[00:27:04] [Music]
[00:27:09] you don't really think like I fall I'm
[00:27:14] gonna fall and die after the first tenth
[00:27:16] of the speed cars many other best
[00:27:18] companions didn't make it and the reason
[00:27:21] is they try so fast so they can have
[00:27:24] gaps they rely on the recall that the
[00:27:27] word of lecture you would be able to
[00:27:28] fill in the gaps because they do
[00:27:29] memorize but it goes so fast and
[00:27:31] sometimes it happens if they swap cards
[00:27:33] if you swap two cars did you have yeah
[00:27:36] you get five minutes and the score is
[00:27:38] nothing to count on it's interesting
[00:27:40] that all the top players didn't make the
[00:27:44] first round so but they have one well
[00:27:46] attempt is really easy down to the last
[00:27:48] line is it really I'm so nervous
[00:28:16] you have one minute remaining
[00:28:35] but it was at that moment that all these
[00:28:36] memories started to be really vivid and
[00:28:40] and playing a lot into my decision so I
[00:28:45] decided to turn around
[00:29:27] [Music]
[00:29:28] [Applause]
[00:29:37] got a calculator but it's really really
[00:29:40] close
[00:29:40] show me check all the yeah all the top
[00:29:49] people got good scores then which is
[00:29:50] good well the first time I turn around
[00:29:57] two years ago I felt I was destroyed
[00:29:59] like I cried I was so emotional it was
[00:30:02] like the worst thing that had happened
[00:30:04] to me what a failure you know and this
[00:30:06] time it just felt like I was okay with
[00:30:08] it I was really happy with my journey
[00:30:11] that was the biggest thing for me it's
[00:30:13] just the whole two months and where I'd
[00:30:14] gone to bed and this mountain brand-new
[00:30:17] side you know I love that that I did
[00:30:20] that it didn't really matter whether or
[00:30:22] not I had stepped on the top of it I
[00:30:24] still feel like I've accomplished
[00:30:25] something that I never would have ever
[00:30:27] thought that I could have done
[00:30:41] so I ended up in seventh place just
[00:30:44] beating out the Norwegian been pretty
[00:30:47] more was sixth through this whole
[00:30:54] process of learning about my mind and
[00:30:56] what's possible and stuff like that it
[00:30:58] really has taught me that if there's a
[00:31:00] skill out there or there's a challenge I
[00:31:02] think I can do it then I can become the
[00:31:04] best or one of the best and I feel like
[00:31:06] anybody can think like this and do this
[00:31:08] it's just a frame of mind
[00:31:12] [Music]
[00:31:16] memories are are what make us who we are
[00:31:20] in the same way that we protect our
[00:31:22] thousands of photos you know by having
[00:31:24] tons of backup just in case it's why
[00:31:28] don't we do that for our minds you can
[00:31:30] just train your mind to be safe and
[00:31:33] protect those memories that you cherish
[00:31:36] and who define you
[00:31:45] we didn't have to carry you the whole
[00:31:47] time how much are we willing to lose
[00:31:51] from our already short lives by losing
[00:31:56] ourselves in our BlackBerry's our
[00:31:59] iPhones by not paying attention to the
[00:32:04] human being across from us who is
[00:32:05] talking with us
[00:32:16] by being so lazy that we're not willing
[00:32:19] to process deeply
[00:32:21] [Music]
[00:32:27] there are incredible memory capacities
[00:32:31] latent in all of us but if you want to
[00:32:36] live a memorable life you have to be the
[00:32:39] kind of person who remembers to remember
[00:32:43] [Music]
[00:32:59] [Music]
[00:33:24] [Music]
[00:33:47] no sleep and arises by doing training
[00:33:51] where's mine that's very good coz I
[00:33:54] believe that's what he is

[00:00:06] have you ever been faced with the
[00:00:08] problem of having to remember something
[00:00:10] perhaps something you were to buy at the
[00:00:13] grocery store or the answer to some
[00:00:16] examination question or the next step in
[00:00:20] a lab experiment or the name of a person
[00:00:23] you wanted to introduce yes it is
[00:00:26] important to be able to remember
[00:00:54] and I just began my consulting business
[00:00:57] and was learning more and more about the
[00:01:00] human mind and going out to people and
[00:01:02] trying to share with them these lessons
[00:01:03] about our brain and our memories and our
[00:01:05] creativity and what I was finding is
[00:01:08] many many people were just totally
[00:01:10] ignorant or weren't up to date in terms
[00:01:13] of what our science world was being to
[00:01:15] uncover and so they said well let's
[00:01:18] start a memory competition when I first
[00:01:26] heard about the u.s. memory champion if
[00:01:28] I figured this had to be a bunch of guys
[00:01:31] who couldn't remember what a girl is
[00:01:32] that that was sort of the image I had in
[00:01:34] my head and I was surprised to show up
[00:01:36] and find out that it was first of all a
[00:01:37] surprisingly diverse group men and women
[00:01:40] a wide range of Ages wide range of
[00:01:43] backgrounds it's it's always been
[00:01:46] amazing to me talking about what people
[00:01:48] ask me the hardest thing and doing a
[00:01:50] memory competition and I always tell
[00:01:51] them the hardest thing you have in
[00:01:53] getting a memory competition together
[00:01:54] for the mental athletes so a mental
[00:01:59] athlete is somebody who trains their
[00:02:02] mind pushes it sort of to the farthest
[00:02:04] extremes to see what they can what they
[00:02:06] can do what their potential is
[00:02:12] [Music]
[00:02:27] three weeks out of high school I took a
[00:02:29] job as a telemarketer I called a guy up
[00:02:31] on the phone I said hey do you want your
[00:02:33] chimney cleaned we clean gemenese he
[00:02:35] said I don't want my chimney cleaned I'm
[00:02:36] trying to sell my house and I said well
[00:02:38] if you're trying to sell your house you
[00:02:39] better have a clean chimney and he
[00:02:41] laughed he said look I don't want my
[00:02:42] chimney clean but will you go to work
[00:02:44] for me I sell memories seminars and I
[00:02:45] want you to work for me and I went to
[00:02:47] work for him I was 18 years old and you
[00:02:49] know that was 18 years ago I'm getting
[00:02:50] ready 36 so I mean it's that's exactly
[00:02:53] half my life and that's such an
[00:02:56] important part of the story because
[00:02:58] people think man this guy is the USA
[00:02:59] memory champion you must be a friggin
[00:03:01] genius no I'm a guy who got kicked out
[00:03:03] of college went to work for a memory
[00:03:05] company when there's 18 and that guy
[00:03:07] taught me this when my marketing
[00:03:11] material says that I'm the nation's
[00:03:13] number-one memory expert I wanted it to
[00:03:15] be true and that was my motivation and
[00:03:18] um and it is now let me out let me show
[00:03:22] this how we in this room think that you
[00:03:25] have a bad memory maybe a bad memory
[00:03:28] aren't gonna work cut out for me
[00:03:30] he does you're making your memories a
[00:03:33] million times better than you think it
[00:03:34] is and you have a memory that is on fire
[00:03:37] the problem is not that you have bad
[00:03:39] memory the problem is it's most likely
[00:03:40] you have an untrained memory I know I
[00:03:43] talk too fast but I try to teach a lot
[00:03:45] of short amount of time I have a number
[00:03:47] of locations all over this ballpark
[00:03:49] these head over to us locations I refer
[00:03:53] to this one files we're new the same
[00:03:55] thing here in this room I want everybody
[00:03:57] to say number one is the strings what's
[00:03:59] one number two is the banner what's to
[00:04:03] freeze the tree what's three three three
[00:04:07] greatest ringing there you go that's
[00:04:09] what I would imagine somebody sitting
[00:04:19] under their knees or making all the
[00:04:20] lines I have turned every Salford into a
[00:04:23] picture every number who's been one in a
[00:04:24] thousand so you say 28 I don't think 28
[00:04:27] I think 9 didn't you say 47
[00:04:29] I don't think 47 I think a rock trying
[00:04:32] out the door to slam dunking a
[00:04:34] basketball my number 3 5 William Tell
[00:04:37] writer he's getting Apple shot off his
[00:04:38] head again here
[00:04:41] in the memory business there's really
[00:04:44] there's really two groups of people
[00:04:45] there are people who go out and they
[00:04:47] teach memory seminars and and then make
[00:04:49] a living selling CDs and memory books
[00:04:51] and that kind of stuff
[00:04:52] and then there's another group of people
[00:04:53] who come who are considered the experts
[00:04:56] and they compete in these tournaments
[00:04:58] and they memorize just a freakish amount
[00:05:00] of information you know and they hold
[00:05:03] all these world records and stuff and
[00:05:04] very in really there's not very many
[00:05:09] people if if any of the what I'm doing
[00:05:13] who really tries to merge the two worlds
[00:05:23] [Applause]
[00:05:27] [Music]
[00:05:35] should be five one five five zero one
[00:05:39] eight two six two four four seven three
[00:05:42] six four eight three one three three
[00:05:46] five eight six two one eight one seven
[00:05:50] four three two seventy-four there's no
[00:05:57] other person in the United States you
[00:05:59] can do what I do the USA championship
[00:06:02] I'm going into that thing and I'm
[00:06:03] thinking this is mine
[00:06:06] [Music]
[00:06:08] we'll start the the day's competition
[00:06:12] off with the ninety nine pictures of
[00:06:14] people with a first and last name and
[00:06:16] each of the competitors has 15 minutes
[00:06:18] you memorize as many of those people's
[00:06:20] names as they possibly can take them
[00:06:22] away after 15 minutes giving back the
[00:06:26] picture scrambled without the names
[00:06:27] under them and they have to write the
[00:06:29] first name in the second name then and
[00:06:31] they've get the point for a first name
[00:06:33] and they get a point for a second name
[00:06:35] mental athletes you may begin one of the
[00:06:46] things I'm always asked is about help me
[00:06:49] remember names and faces it is probably
[00:06:52] the most frequently asked question even
[00:06:54] of our mental athletes as they do these
[00:06:56] 99 pictures with names and faces well
[00:06:59] how do you do that alright so names and
[00:07:05] faces is one of the trickier events so
[00:07:09] what you got to do is kind of use a
[00:07:11] distinguishing feature on their face so
[00:07:13] say somebody has a big nose you use
[00:07:15] their big nose whatever comes to you
[00:07:17] first and then ask me for their name say
[00:07:20] it's Joe I think of like a sloppy joe
[00:07:23] burger so combine the two images just
[00:07:26] slop that slop ijou all over his nose is
[00:07:28] dripping down as no
[00:07:30] the idea is the next time you meet him
[00:07:32] you're not gonna think about what was
[00:07:34] his name you're gonna see Panos
[00:07:35] like he did the first time I came out of
[00:07:37] you and then sloppy-joe on the nose and
[00:07:40] then Joe fluffy Joe Joe
[00:07:53] so last year for the 2010 competition I
[00:07:56] had trained really hard and so I went
[00:07:59] into the competition really really ready
[00:08:01] I'm feeling super confident I think a
[00:08:04] big part of that confidence came from
[00:08:05] the fact that nobody really expected me
[00:08:08] to do well I did the first event which
[00:08:12] was names I actually did surprisingly
[00:08:14] well I got 109 correct names and that
[00:08:18] put me in the top seven and you know at
[00:08:19] that point people were starting to be
[00:08:20] like hey who's like that's cool Congrats
[00:08:23] it wasn't really until the next event
[00:08:26] the numbers where people were like okay
[00:08:28] this guy's serious because I broke us
[00:08:31] record I memorize one hundred and
[00:08:32] seventy eight digits and that broke
[00:08:35] Ronnie's record who was very sportsmen
[00:08:39] liked about it but I know inside he was
[00:08:41] crying anyway so at that point we got
[00:08:43] serious then we did speak cards I also
[00:08:46] did really well I won the event with 98
[00:08:49] seconds I think and at that point was
[00:08:51] number one in the standings so I had
[00:08:53] kind of shocked everybody I guess
[00:08:56] because they didn't expect me to be
[00:08:58] there and Ronnie white I know was kind
[00:09:00] of in turmoil in his head and at that
[00:09:02] point I was like okay wow Here I am all
[00:09:04] I have to do is memorize two decks of
[00:09:05] cards memorizing cards is my forte so we
[00:09:09] went backstage to memorize the two decks
[00:09:11] of cards and they made a big point about
[00:09:13] which way you picked up the deck of
[00:09:16] cards to start memorizing because they
[00:09:18] had a fixed order that they were gonna
[00:09:20] compare to so I actually memorized a
[00:09:24] deck of cards by picking it up and
[00:09:26] starting from the bottom working my way
[00:09:29] backwards but what they wanted was you
[00:09:30] flip it over and start from the back and
[00:09:32] go upwards but in my mind I was like
[00:09:35] okay that's fine I'll just you know a
[00:09:36] little bit slower but I'll do it that
[00:09:38] way so they said three two one go and of
[00:09:41] course I just mindlessly in the zone
[00:09:43] just flip them over and do them the
[00:09:45] right the way that I know how
[00:09:55] [Music]
[00:10:09] it's definitely a lot of pressure for me
[00:10:11] to kind of show what I can do and that
[00:10:14] that's tough because I know everybody's
[00:10:16] gonna be looking at me and know I'm
[00:10:17] gonna be stuck in the front row I know
[00:10:19] I'm gonna be sitting next to Ronnie yeah
[00:10:21] it definitely gets to me
[00:10:28] [Applause]
[00:11:04] [Music]
[00:11:09] [Music]
[00:11:15] when I'm memorizing things whether it's
[00:11:17] a deck of cards or numbers or even a
[00:11:19] poem in a way it's similar to juggling
[00:11:22] because when I'm juggling the balls
[00:11:24] always go in a certain pattern I think
[00:11:27] that the the juggling the keeping thing
[00:11:29] going the keeping track or saying
[00:11:31] pulling things back if something goes
[00:11:33] too far that has really helped me of my
[00:11:36] memorization techniques I perform school
[00:11:40] assembly shows for elementary schools
[00:11:43] where I have a fun show about money a
[00:11:48] former financial planner and since I was
[00:11:52] 12
[00:11:52] I've been a professional entertainer the
[00:11:54] juggler magician comedy clown and I've
[00:11:58] combined the two to create a show that
[00:12:00] teaches kids the basics of personal
[00:12:02] finance before the show when I'm
[00:12:08] mingling with the kids they always say
[00:12:10] are you magician this is magic show I
[00:12:13] said not really a magician usually by
[00:12:16] the end they say you're a clown aren't
[00:12:18] you that's music to my ears
[00:12:21] [Applause]
[00:12:23] [Music]
[00:12:30] it depends on what you define is cook
[00:12:33] if-if-if showing up and looking at a
[00:12:37] bunch of things that we have in a
[00:12:39] cupboard and then throwing them together
[00:12:40] and making a really good meal out of it
[00:12:42] is cooking bath by far if following a
[00:12:46] recipe in a book and doing it exactly
[00:12:48] the way it says and coming up with a
[00:12:51] great meal afterwards I definitely am
[00:12:54] Beth says someone spent at least hours
[00:13:03] if not days or years experimenting with
[00:13:05] this recipe to come up with it exactly
[00:13:07] this way knowing that the quarter
[00:13:10] teaspoon of nutmeg is perfect not you
[00:13:14] know an eighth of a teaspoon or not a
[00:13:15] half of a teaspoon actually everybody in
[00:13:26] my family every time I talk to house
[00:13:28] Brad doing with his memory training they
[00:13:31] all want to know everybody wants to all
[00:13:33] my friends asked that I told your
[00:13:35] parents just the other night about the
[00:13:38] concept behind behind it and I think
[00:13:40] they start to grasp it they're 83 so
[00:13:43] memory is very much on their minds
[00:13:52] [Music]
[00:14:03] [Music]
[00:14:07] the idea how many random digits like
[00:14:10] zero four seven nine three can you
[00:14:12] remember in five minutes actually had a
[00:14:25] big mountaineering expedition of 2009 to
[00:14:28] Mount McKinley in Alaska so when I was
[00:14:31] there my grandmother actually passed
[00:14:34] away she had Alzheimer's every time we
[00:14:38] visit we'd see her kind of getting in
[00:14:40] this worse state which was really
[00:14:41] upsetting and finally she passed away I
[00:14:44] couldn't believe it you know it was kind
[00:14:47] of shocking that something to do with
[00:14:50] the brain can you know leave someone
[00:14:52] down this path and eventually have them
[00:14:55] pass away
[00:14:56] I've always been close to her and now
[00:14:58] that she's gone it's kind of like she's
[00:15:01] given me this motivation to really train
[00:15:03] my memory cuz I don't want to end up
[00:15:04] like that and that's probably something
[00:15:07] that runs in my family you know
[00:15:10] [Music]
[00:15:14] the mind is something that we need to be
[00:15:17] aware of just as much as taking care of
[00:15:19] our physical body we can work at helping
[00:15:24] it we can work at training it we can
[00:15:26] work at strengthening it and not just
[00:15:29] take for granted that well I'm a little
[00:15:31] bit older so of course I don't remember
[00:15:33] things as well I'm gonna write a number
[00:15:40] in your hands okay close your eyes tell
[00:15:44] me what number I write what number was
[00:15:47] that good good
[00:15:58] six while today we don't have any cures
[00:16:03] for memory problems I think there's a
[00:16:06] growing body of evidence that there are
[00:16:08] a number of lifestyle and behavioral
[00:16:10] factors that come into play people who
[00:16:17] stay mentally active playing games
[00:16:19] Bridge cards chess checkers Sudoku
[00:16:23] puzzles crossword puzzles may also show
[00:16:26] a reduction in their risk good very good
[00:16:41] very good
[00:16:43] [Music]
[00:16:55] there's now a lot of interest in sort of
[00:16:58] brain training or brain exercises to try
[00:17:01] to expand people's ability to recall
[00:17:03] information and one of the ways we need
[00:17:05] to think about it is how can we develop
[00:17:08] exercises that allow us to enhance some
[00:17:12] of our abilities you know I was walking
[00:17:17] through on Saturday night I was walking
[00:17:20] through Sheraton Hotel in Dallas and you
[00:17:23] know every parking spot is numbered you
[00:17:26] know has a three-digit number on every
[00:17:27] single parking spot and I was just
[00:17:31] looking at him you know I was looking at
[00:17:33] all the numbers and I was looking at all
[00:17:34] license plates and my friends realized
[00:17:36] that what are you doing memorizing all
[00:17:42] these numbers you know if I'm driving
[00:17:43] down the road and I'm seeing license
[00:17:45] plates I'm immediately turning the
[00:17:47] numbers in the pictures if I see
[00:17:48] billboards I'm in immediately
[00:17:50] translating it into a picture and if I'm
[00:17:51] longer than a shirt in hotel and my
[00:17:53] friends won't do a party I'm looking at
[00:17:55] the numbers and the parking spots
[00:17:57] memorize them you doing this right here
[00:18:00] so it's like something that's ingrained
[00:18:02] in me you know it's a habit now I've
[00:18:08] always been me do creative things like I
[00:18:11] can do a lot of things but I can't do
[00:18:13] any of them like perfectly or really
[00:18:16] well I'm a jack of all trades but master
[00:18:18] of none right but you know this was
[00:18:21] memory training was kind of like the
[00:18:24] first thing that I wanted to be a master
[00:18:26] of and after I got into this regimen of
[00:18:30] practicing daily and seeing these
[00:18:33] awesome improvements I just got hooked
[00:18:34] and it became kind of this obsession to
[00:18:37] train and try and beat my scores from
[00:18:39] the previous day I do three or four
[00:18:42] decks of cards every morning when I wake
[00:18:45] up then I do throughout the day sets of
[00:18:48] names and faces maybe through four times
[00:18:50] lunch time I do a set of numbers when I
[00:18:53] come
[00:18:53] from work and do another set of numbers
[00:18:54] and that's pretty much what I've been
[00:18:56] doing on repeats for the past six seven
[00:18:59] months so I'd say I spent maybe three
[00:19:02] four hours a day right now memorizing
[00:19:05] stuff my correct assuming you hold the
[00:19:18] record last year's record yep luster
[00:19:20] memorizing the amount of numbers I broke
[00:19:22] the record lot the US record for
[00:19:23] memorizing numbers in five minutes one
[00:19:25] hundred and seventy eight digits so now
[00:19:27] some one of the things we wanted to do
[00:19:29] was sort of have fun with your memory
[00:19:31] skills and sort of test them out a
[00:19:33] little bit so up here I have a blank map
[00:19:35] in a second we're gonna put up some
[00:19:36] cities and temperatures I'm gonna give
[00:19:38] you three or five minutes yes just sit
[00:19:42] and memorize everything sure you're
[00:19:44] gonna turn around and then we're gonna
[00:19:45] see how much it goes sounds good
[00:19:55] how do you feel it's it's hard but let's
[00:19:59] let's give it a go anyways so we had
[00:20:00] caribou that was 32 degrees yeah I know
[00:20:04] Bismarck was eight degrees Phoenix
[00:20:06] well 73 course Oakland Oakland was 57
[00:20:12] okay what about Roswell Roswell about 65
[00:20:18] Dario
[00:20:20] 80 Brownsville I think 72 I could be
[00:20:25] wrong okay
[00:20:27] it was 77 you guys okay
[00:20:29] every single one right except for one
[00:20:31] you tired right now do you feel spenta
[00:20:34] no no no going through that is a bit
[00:20:36] nerve-wracking but then now that it's
[00:20:38] there it's it's fine 62 is a Sandra
[00:20:42] Bullock from speed movie you know she's
[00:20:44] driving a bus so that movie took place
[00:20:46] in Los Angeles stars like that makes 62
[00:20:49] have to do with it well 62 is the image
[00:20:52] that of the bus remember I was telling
[00:20:54] that every pair of digits for me means
[00:20:56] something is like a person in action or
[00:20:58] an object in that case I use it as an
[00:21:00] object it's a lot of work that you go
[00:21:02] through to memorize one thing but I
[00:21:04] guess it is at this point it's just
[00:21:06] second nature I don't I don't have to
[00:21:08] read these numbers anymore and translate
[00:21:09] them I see that it's like learning a
[00:21:12] language right I mean you speak French
[00:21:14] so if you see the word yeah which means
[00:21:16] dog you have to think that oh this is
[00:21:19] the word for dog you just if you're
[00:21:21] fluent in something you just see it and
[00:21:22] that's what it is it's a shame that none
[00:21:24] of this these techniques which are no
[00:21:26] secret I mean it's just not many people
[00:21:28] know about them
[00:21:29] it's a shame that they're not being
[00:21:31] taught to kids you know in schools as
[00:21:35] large and it's not in place of actually
[00:21:37] studying in knowledge it's just a way to
[00:21:39] memorize information that can help you
[00:21:41] exactly with your knowledge right yeah I
[00:21:43] mean it's it's not some fancy trick it's
[00:21:45] actually applicable you know to learning
[00:21:48] stuff even if you mean say you're
[00:21:50] learning the presidents and all you have
[00:21:51] in your head are these weird pictures
[00:21:53] that nothing to do as presidents it's
[00:21:54] still a way to get you to remember the
[00:21:56] presidents and as long as you know you
[00:21:58] have you have it memorized through those
[00:22:00] bizarre images you know that's at least
[00:22:02] a stepping stone to to actually fully
[00:22:05] learning something
[00:22:13] differently we're going to get the
[00:22:15] answer sheets back we're going to swap
[00:22:16] the neighbor your
[00:22:31] they were flipped it was 96
[00:22:34] [Music]
[00:22:38] so 236
[00:22:43] sweets
[00:22:48] to 3506
[00:22:53] six 178 practicing a little bit okay the
[00:23:11] third event of the day is remembering
[00:23:14] the order of the deck of cards they have
[00:23:25] to run through that pack of cards and
[00:23:27] memorize it in as little time as
[00:23:28] possible
[00:23:35] [Music]
[00:23:42] this is kind of the most surprising
[00:23:44] thing about the us memory champion is
[00:23:46] that this entire quote-unquote sport of
[00:23:49] competitive memorizing it's that the
[00:23:51] abilities that these people are
[00:23:53] displaying aren't actually latent in all
[00:23:56] of us anybody can learn to remember vast
[00:24:01] quantities of information using the
[00:24:02] right kinds of techniques and the right
[00:24:04] kind of practice
[00:24:05] all right so memorizing deck of cards
[00:24:07] each card has a person associated with
[00:24:12] an image of a person an image of an
[00:24:16] action and an image of an object so like
[00:24:18] the five hearts is my buddy's climber
[00:24:20] his action is something that has to do
[00:24:23] that it's climbing a mountain and the
[00:24:26] object is a mountain Queen of Hearts is
[00:24:28] my mom her action is cooking and her
[00:24:30] object is a pot my dad is King of Hearts
[00:24:34] his action is signing and the object is
[00:24:37] paper so I don't just picture you know
[00:24:39] the five of hearts and then move on I
[00:24:40] actually takes three cards at a time and
[00:24:42] squeeze them into one story and that's a
[00:24:46] set the first card is the person so five
[00:24:49] of Hearts I take that as the guy my
[00:24:52] friend then the next card says Queen of
[00:24:54] Hearts that's my mom but it's in the
[00:24:56] action slots so I would picture my
[00:24:59] friend Mike cooking right Ferb and then
[00:25:01] say King of Hearts was the last card in
[00:25:03] the set
[00:25:04] that's paper so but objects so I
[00:25:06] pictured my friend Mike cooking some
[00:25:09] paper and it's my cousin Vinnie he's
[00:25:11] climbing the university a stormtrooper
[00:25:15] from Star Wars using a Taser on french
[00:25:21] fries as Tiger Woods and he is dealing
[00:25:25] cards
[00:25:28] somebody's mom Ben Franklin blowing
[00:25:32] bubbles at a sword that's Oliver North
[00:25:37] he's counting money and the last one I
[00:25:40] usually just quickly remember based on
[00:25:42] what it is and this is a sumo person the
[00:25:47] second part is sticking those pictures
[00:25:50] on objects or in rooms along a journey
[00:25:53] they're called anchor points or I call
[00:25:55] them anchor points different places I'm
[00:25:56] going to put a mental picture they'll
[00:25:59] take familiar places in my mind like my
[00:26:02] childhood home my current home workplace
[00:26:06] and I set it out in my mind kind of like
[00:26:09] a walk through that I'll walk through
[00:26:12] the exact same way every time
[00:26:48] at the tournaments you know they'll hear
[00:26:50] guys complaining you know I've
[00:26:52] distracted because there's cameras over
[00:26:53] there I'm distracted because something
[00:26:55] was dropping over there and and I don't
[00:26:58] even notice it you know and the reason I
[00:27:00] don't notice is because I didn't have
[00:27:01] trained and extreme surface
[00:27:02] circumstances like this and at the
[00:27:04] tournament I don't even notice some
[00:27:06] stretches it's time to see how I did
[00:27:32] trying to pick your time put down your
[00:27:42] 52
[00:27:52] thirty Seconds ringing okay I'm going to
[00:28:18] New York City I'm bringing balloons and
[00:28:21] a shoe my girlfriend is Magda and we met
[00:28:26] in Miami we've been together about a
[00:28:28] year and a quarter and we moved together
[00:28:31] to the Boston and she's been through
[00:28:34] this whole ordeal with me
[00:28:36] you know I'm constantly saying I'll be
[00:28:38] right there I just gotta memorize a
[00:28:39] couple of things that I be in my room
[00:28:41] for like an hour so I can imagine that
[00:28:44] on her part it can get annoying a bit
[00:28:48] obsessive about it but I feel like she's
[00:28:50] been really supportive when I first met
[00:28:52] him he asked me what my favorite number
[00:28:55] was and I was like okay you know I had
[00:28:59] never really I mean I thought about it I
[00:29:01] guess when you're younger like you have
[00:29:02] a favorite number but I was like why is
[00:29:05] this guy asking me and I told them I was
[00:29:07] like um it's 9 you know why and he's
[00:29:11] like don't worry I was just that's a
[00:29:13] good number it's a good number but don't
[00:29:14] worry I was like okay interesting and
[00:29:17] then he told me you know all of that is
[00:29:19] mountain climbing and everything that
[00:29:21] he's been into throughout the years he
[00:29:24] just has a lot of interests and it's not
[00:29:26] every day that you meet someone who you
[00:29:29] know memorizes cards and numbers and
[00:29:32] wants to climb Mount Everest and like
[00:29:34] he's a nerd but he's a cool nerd and
[00:29:37] that's what I like give them 200 words
[00:29:44] and they get 15 minutes to remember as
[00:29:47] many of those 200 words as they can we
[00:29:50] bring him back on stage and
[00:29:52] I begin by asking the first person with
[00:29:54] the first word is in the second person
[00:29:56] the second word is
[00:30:16] first word focus is the first murder
[00:30:20] honey it's over to you hey order

[00:30:38] moving over to the sixth word will
[00:30:41] correct from the sixteenth work nothing
[00:30:44] except deep for Nelson run run is
[00:30:46] correct
[00:30:47] now we're on Sol Sol 37th word elevator

[00:31:30] it's to deck of cards with three mental
[00:31:33] athletes they get five minutes to take
[00:31:36] those two decks of cards offstage study
[00:31:39] the orders and we come back and Here I
[00:31:42] am with the deck of cards with the first
[00:31:44] athlete giving me the first card in the
[00:31:46] second athlete giving me the second card
[00:31:47] in the third athlete the third card only
[00:31:50] one person is left standing the us
[00:31:51] memory champion first part is the queen
[00:31:54] of clubs
[00:32:20] it's not about beating them it's about
[00:32:23] me pushing my mind and me doing stuff
[00:32:28] that I didn't think I could do you know
[00:32:30] getting better more mentally sharp and
[00:32:33] that's very very appealing to me queen

[00:32:47] clubs eight of clubs four spades three
[00:32:58] diamonds six of spades
[00:33:03] three of clubs Jack of Diamonds
[00:33:09] [Applause]
[00:33:17] when I train is like I'm reinforcing
[00:33:20] these memories like actual memories of
[00:33:23] places I used to live people I love
[00:33:26] people that are gone
[00:33:28] made up people that I enjoy watching or
[00:33:32] thinking about you know they're in my
[00:33:34] everyday life and they get stamped there
[00:33:37] forever and that's awesome that you know
[00:33:39] house I just living as a child is now in
[00:33:42] here whenever I want it and I may never
[00:33:45] see the place again yeah I may have some
[00:33:48] photos of it but I actually have the
[00:33:51] place in here if I ever want to go there
[00:33:53] I just go
[00:33:54] [Music]
[00:33:56] that's another thing about these memory
[00:33:58] techniques is you get to keep those
[00:33:59] places for life
[00:34:01] you have to store them in there and
[00:34:04] you know that's that's what life's about
[00:34:06] you know those little moments there's
[00:34:08] those these tiny things that
[00:34:12] you sit there and think about and just

[00:35:31] Nelson down
[00:35:38] [Applause]
[00:35:46] [Applause]
[00:35:53] I've actually thanked my friends my
[00:35:57] girlfriend especially for putting up
[00:35:59] with all the time that I spent
[00:36:00] memorizing it not
[00:36:06] [Applause]
[00:36:15] [Applause]
[00:36:18] [Music]
[00:36:21] they come from experiences like I told
[00:36:24] you how it memorize cards and numbers
[00:36:26] it's me thinking of things that are
[00:36:28] familiar to me and that has to do with
[00:36:29] all of them are my friends and a lot of
[00:36:31] those people are here today and you know
[00:36:33] like this deck of cards these two decks
[00:36:35] of cards I memorized in my grandma's
[00:36:38] countryside house in France you know and
[00:36:42] I really want to dedicate this to her
[00:36:44] because this is I wouldn't be here
[00:36:46] otherwise I really inspired me after she
[00:36:49] passed having Alzheimer's I was afraid
[00:36:52] for myself I wanted to show myself and
[00:36:55] others that whether they the training
[00:36:57] you can have the tools in your mind to
[00:36:59] you know maybe
[00:37:01] protect yourself in the future if you
[00:37:03] have struggles with your memory so I
[00:37:05] want to inspire people hopefully to just
[00:37:09] learn a few things that I've done and
[00:37:11] what we've done and you'll see the
[00:37:13] difference and it'll pay off thank you
[00:37:15] so much
[00:37:17] [Applause]
[00:37:24] but really for me the motivation that
[00:37:26] was always helped people have fun you
[00:37:31] know there's a lot of things that are
[00:37:32] really serious in this world if I can
[00:37:34] help people have fun for 15 minutes or
[00:37:37] half hour or 45 minutes and learn
[00:37:39] something at the same time that's that's
[00:37:42] a dream come true to me it's a fun ride
[00:37:45] you know and I just I want to always
[00:37:48] keep challenging myself you know where
[00:37:51] there's memorizing baseball stats or you
[00:37:54] know we'll country the country music
[00:37:56] charts or whatever I enjoy that the next
[00:37:59] thing what's the next thing
[00:38:00] [Music]
[00:38:18] you

=== 5 MEMORY TIPS TO GET YOU STARTED // RANDOM MEMORY TIPS #011 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEx60e_45-Q

[00:00:00] what's up guys Nelson Dellis here for
[00:00:02] another episode of random memory tips
[00:00:04] and a lot of you guys have been asking
[00:00:06] me for shorter five quick how-to tips
[00:00:10] rather than the long tutorials which
[00:00:11] I'll keep on doing but I want to give
[00:00:13] some quick tips out there for memory in
[00:00:16] general maybe not specifically how to do
[00:00:18] something but five general tips on some
[00:00:21] topic to help you with your memory game
[00:00:23] I'm at Hong Kong right now it's about
[00:00:25] two types moving outside I figured I'd
[00:00:26] just make a little video for you all
[00:00:38] right so I've made a number of videos so
[00:00:40] far how to memorise decks of cards how
[00:00:43] to memorize text how to memorize Korean
[00:00:46] all the stuff but I've never really done
[00:00:48] a basic five tips to generally improve
[00:00:51] your memory so if you want to improve
[00:00:53] your memory these are the kind of the
[00:00:54] five general tips you to follow to have
[00:00:56] an unstoppable memory tip number one
[00:00:58] [Music]
[00:01:00] being good at memorizing starts with
[00:01:03] having great focus and paying attention
[00:01:05] here's a cool thing if you're saying to
[00:01:07] yourself I have a hard time focusing I'm
[00:01:09] always thinking about other things
[00:01:11] getting into memory will actually help
[00:01:13] your focus as your memory gets better
[00:01:16] and better with practice you'll find
[00:01:17] that you become better at focusing so it
[00:01:19] kind of speeds itself but I often tell
[00:01:22] myself if I want to focus just being
[00:01:24] aware of that fact and telling myself in
[00:01:26] my head hey I should probably pay
[00:01:28] attention or hey this is important I'm
[00:01:30] gonna hone in all my mental strength on
[00:01:32] this right now so that I can memorize it
[00:01:34] you'll find yourself doing that more as
[00:01:36] you get into this memory world and the
[00:01:38] more that you memorize the stronger that
[00:01:40] focus power will become tip number two
[00:01:42] this what are we talking about practice
[00:01:45] are we talking about practice man what
[00:01:48] are we talking about I know that
[00:01:49] practice gets a bad rap
[00:01:50] I know practice can take up time that's
[00:01:53] what practice is doing something when
[00:01:56] you probably could be doing something
[00:01:57] else but you don't get good at something
[00:01:58] unless you practice sorry
[00:02:00] that's that's the bad news for you but
[00:02:03] that's for any thing in the world if you
[00:02:06] have plans to be good at one particular
[00:02:08] thing and you think you're gonna be good
[00:02:10] at it without practice you're wrong you
[00:02:12] out of practice the great thing about
[00:02:14] memory and practice is that you don't
[00:02:16] necessarily have to sit down like I do
[00:02:18] where the shuffle deck of cards with a
[00:02:20] printout of numbers all this stuff that
[00:02:22] you have to prep practice for memory can
[00:02:24] happen in your daily life you have to do
[00:02:26] lists you have grocery lists you have
[00:02:28] people you're gonna meet you have
[00:02:29] directions you need to memorize all
[00:02:31] these types of things that come in in
[00:02:32] your daily life you can practice with
[00:02:34] those now I know it's tempting to want
[00:02:36] to type in all those things in your
[00:02:38] phone put it on a computer get someone
[00:02:40] else to put it in your logbook whatever
[00:02:42] your calendar make the effort practice
[00:02:44] try to use your memory to remember
[00:02:46] things that are useful to you in your
[00:02:48] everyday life use your memory or you'll
[00:02:50] lose your memory - number three patron
[00:02:53] things so if you watch any of my videos
[00:02:55] so far you've noticed that every time
[00:02:57] I'm talking about memorizing something
[00:02:59] the first step is always turning what
[00:03:01] we're memorizing into a picture a
[00:03:03] picture you can visualize in your mind's
[00:03:05] eye and that's always the first step of
[00:03:07] memorizing something figuring out a way
[00:03:09] to encode the information into a picture
[00:03:13] if it's a complicated number how do I
[00:03:15] turn it into a picture if it's a poem
[00:03:17] that's super abstract how do I turn
[00:03:19] those words into something I can
[00:03:20] visualize and the list goes on so as
[00:03:23] long as you can find a way to visualize
[00:03:25] what you're memorizing that's step one
[00:03:28] our brains remember pictures better than
[00:03:31] words it's proven there's been studies
[00:03:33] that show this and it's obvious if I
[00:03:35] show you a very abstract symbol numbers
[00:03:38] or password codes or whatever it's hard
[00:03:42] for our brains to look at that and say
[00:03:44] hmm that's digestible I can memorize
[00:03:46] that you can't it takes a lot of effort
[00:03:48] but if I show you a series of pictures I
[00:03:51] guarantee you will remember those very
[00:03:53] well even if you're not trying that's
[00:03:55] because your brain just soaks that stuff
[00:03:57] right up so thinking pictures encode the
[00:03:59] information that you're trying to
[00:04:00] memorize into a picture all right tip
[00:04:03] number four stories find a way to store
[00:04:06] the information that you're memorizing a
[00:04:08] lot of people ask me what that means
[00:04:09] I've shown it in a bunch of my videos
[00:04:11] with the memory palace the linking
[00:04:13] system it's basically putting those
[00:04:15] pictures that you encoded into your
[00:04:18] brain in the location where you can
[00:04:19] easily retrieve it
[00:04:21] because that's really what memory is all
[00:04:22] about is sure I can memorize something
[00:04:24] and
[00:04:25] but it's no use unless you can retrieve
[00:04:27] it easily right if you know exactly
[00:04:29] where it is
[00:04:30] when you need it so that's a big tip
[00:04:32] find a way to store it and by store it
[00:04:35] what I'm really saying is find a way to
[00:04:38] relate it to anchor it to things that
[00:04:41] you already know so learn more about
[00:04:43] this step watch some of my other videos
[00:04:45] I'll link them in the description and
[00:04:47] tip number five so everybody asks me how
[00:04:50] do I get that information in my head
[00:04:52] forever for a long time we're talking
[00:04:55] about long-term memory here and the
[00:04:57] answer is and this is tip number five is
[00:04:58] review review review there's no way
[00:05:02] around this unfortunately if you want to
[00:05:04] move something into your long-term
[00:05:05] memory
[00:05:06] you got to review it quite frequently at
[00:05:08] the beginning but then over time you can
[00:05:09] taper off and it'll slowly work its way
[00:05:12] into your long-term memory there are
[00:05:14] apps to help you do this great one I
[00:05:16] like to use is Anki you can make

[00:05:24] all the techniques I teach get
[00:05:26] information into your head really
[00:05:28] quickly which is important but the key
[00:05:31] to keeping it for a long time is to

[00:05:42] can review by just thinking about it
[00:05:44] actually try to recall go through the
[00:05:46] active process of recalling what you
[00:05:48] memorize in your head or say it out loud

=== HOW TO MEMORIZE A SPEECH OR TEXT ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuZz9wrpNBw

[00:00:00] hello and welcome to another episode of
[00:00:02] random memory tips and in this episode
[00:00:04] we are going to talk about something
[00:00:06] that I get asked about all the time how
[00:00:09] do i memorize taxes to be honest it's
[00:00:12] hard it's very hard why because there
[00:00:15] are so many little work and on top of
[00:00:17] that if you say it deliberate with
[00:00:20] intention and fluidity and all these
[00:00:22] things make it seem like it's naturally
[00:00:24] coming out of it you don't have to think
[00:00:25] about it try to hack it
[00:00:27] I was in Boston this past weekend go all
[00:00:29] historical and I thought of the
[00:00:31] Declaration and it ought to be a great
[00:00:33] piece of text but we can practice
[00:00:35] together to show how I would go about
[00:00:37] memorizing something like that you go
[00:00:39] fly this to your speeches you can apply
[00:00:41] this to learning lines you can apply
[00:00:43] this to memorizing some passage or coke
[00:00:46] or whatever you want and so without
[00:00:48] further ado here we go have the first
[00:00:58] paragraph of the Declaration of
[00:01:00] Independence in front of me do you read
[00:01:02] through it a few times just to kind of
[00:01:04] get the gist and it's okay if you don't
[00:01:05] memorize it at that point the next step
[00:01:07] is to use that memory palace again I'm
[00:01:12] using that memory palace it is a go-to
[00:01:14] thing to use when you have to memorize
[00:01:16] something and memorizing text is no
[00:01:18] different among memory athletes a lot of
[00:01:20] us kind of battle back and forth what's
[00:01:22] the right way to approach memorizing
[00:01:24] texts is it one memorize every single
[00:01:27] word by putting them all in memory
[00:01:30] palaces pour memorize the general
[00:01:33] phrasing of all our texts and place
[00:01:36] those ideas in the memory palace and
[00:01:39] then rehearse it enough so that you know
[00:01:41] the filler words on one hand this will
[00:01:44] guarantee that you get everything as
[00:01:45] you're putting everything in read more
[00:01:46] palatable whereas this one is more the
[00:01:49] idea and then you're going to use that
[00:01:51] repetition rehearsal to fill in the
[00:01:53] words the memory part is a lot of huge I
[00:01:55] believe that if your goal is to get
[00:01:58] something across very fluid and natural
[00:02:00] that this option is the way to go
[00:02:02] because you're going to have the ideas
[00:02:04] in your head and the rest will be
[00:02:05] rehearsed so you can use your memory
[00:02:07] palace as a guide to help you through
[00:02:09] what you memorize but the other stuff is
[00:02:11] super
[00:02:11] colonel eyes all right so I've broken up
[00:02:13] set first paragraph into 11 different
[00:02:16] phrases they vary in size and length and
[00:02:19] complexity let's go to where Beltran
[00:02:21] with a poem this would be easier because
[00:02:23] there's going to be a certain beat to it
[00:02:24] with text maybe even sent in short
[00:02:27] enough that your phrase it's like a
[00:02:29] conjunction you can confident and or
[00:02:31] whatever feels right each of those
[00:02:33] phrases are going to be turned into a
[00:02:35] picture or a series of pictures that we
[00:02:38] put in our memory palace like we've done
[00:02:41] before to do this with you I want to
[00:02:43] choose a memory palace that we can do
[00:02:44] together what I was saying is we can use
[00:02:46] a map or journey through the United
[00:02:49] States using the more familiar cities as
[00:02:52] the locations or memory column so chosen
[00:02:55] eleven cities around the country and
[00:02:57] since I'm from Miami will start in Miami
[00:03:00] that'll be our first location and so
[00:03:02] what we'll do is we'll kind of make our
[00:03:03] way up the East Coast cross the country
[00:03:05] and what's easy to remember that each
[00:03:09] city will kind of choose something that
[00:03:11] reminds us about this video to find an
[00:03:14] anchor so we'll be in Miami next to be
[00:03:16] Washington DC then Philadelphia New York
[00:03:19] City Boston Buffalo which is where
[00:03:22] Niagara Falls is to the middle of the
[00:03:24] country that's Chicago Denver Las Vegas
[00:03:26] LA and up a little bit we have San
[00:03:29] Francisco got it so we're starting in
[00:03:32] Miami and we have our first little
[00:03:34] segment which is going to be when in the
[00:03:37] course of human events now remember I'm
[00:03:39] not doing it word-for-word that's going
[00:03:41] to be a different approach I'm trying to
[00:03:43] go for the one that's quickest I think
[00:03:45] this is the quickest all right look at
[00:03:46] that sentence I got to choose kind of
[00:03:48] the key words key features and in my
[00:03:51] head I see course human events so I kind
[00:03:54] of string those words into a little
[00:03:55] image and I'm going to attach it to
[00:03:57] Miami what I think of course I think of
[00:04:01] like a boat on its course imagine the
[00:04:03] boat is on the course arriving at Miami
[00:04:06] and there's a lot of human events going
[00:04:08] on right maybe a lot of those events are
[00:04:11] very bizarre and of a particular taste
[00:04:13] there's a course to all of these human
[00:04:16] events boom that's it that's the first
[00:04:18] one we got it when you're trying to
[00:04:20] remember this you're going to say okay I
[00:04:22] started my teen beach course human event
[00:04:24] of course you're not going to say course
[00:04:25] human events that's not the line but
[00:04:28] once we finish this step you're going to
[00:04:30] start filling in the word so then you
[00:04:32] only add that is went in and up all
[00:04:36] right let's move on next up we are
[00:04:38] moving to Washington DC okay and my
[00:04:40] picture for that was a declaration of
[00:04:42] independence the next phrase is it
[00:04:44] becomes necessary for one people so I
[00:04:47] can picture one person and I'm just
[00:04:50] going to imagine that it becomes
[00:04:52] necessary for that one person to have
[00:04:55] this document like he's breaking into
[00:04:57] this museum where the Declaration of
[00:04:59] Independence is just overcome by how
[00:05:03] necessary it is for this one person can
[00:05:07] have is done so it becomes necessary
[00:05:09] next up we're moving out to Philly
[00:05:11] Philadelphia and we have a belt right
[00:05:14] that's what that could be stainless
[00:05:15] force the next line we have is to
[00:05:18] dissolve the political bands dissolved
[00:05:20] and banned political bands so those are
[00:05:23] kind of the three words that I'm going
[00:05:25] to put together so I can imagine
[00:05:26] political band if I take those two words
[00:05:29] and just literally picture a band like a
[00:05:31] headband or an armed man that very
[00:05:34] political so maybe it has the person you
[00:05:36] voted for let's say if I put it on this
[00:05:38] Bell its invoke this picture that
[00:05:40] dissolving the political band so after
[00:05:42] that we move up to Central Park New York
[00:05:44] City that's our next location the next
[00:05:46] phrase is which have connected them with
[00:05:50] another I'm in Central Park
[00:05:52] that's my location and there's a which
[00:05:54] which is that first order the break
[00:05:55] connected with another so I'm going to
[00:05:58] picture this which running around
[00:06:00] Central Park connecting them let's just
[00:06:04] imagine that them is kind of old people
[00:06:06] in the party so
[00:06:08] picture this which going up to people
[00:06:10] and connecting them maybe she literally
[00:06:13] creates some sticky glue that connects
[00:06:16] them all together here we go to Boston
[00:06:18] is the next to the F and our picture for
[00:06:20] Boston was Harvard which is a beautiful
[00:06:22] campus in a very story the next line is
[00:06:24] and to assume among the powers of the
[00:06:28] earth powers of the earth that's kind of
[00:06:30] a nice little chunk I can picture that
[00:06:32] and assume I'm going to say assume even
[00:06:35] a minor one might want to include that
[00:06:37] assume among powers of the earth when I
[00:06:39] hear the word assume I think of a big
[00:06:41] and then among kind of sound like a monk
[00:06:44] so I'm going to picture and ask on top
[00:06:48] of a monk his ass touches the monk he
[00:06:50] suddenly had all the powers of the earth
[00:06:52] the earth around it vibrates and totally
[00:06:55] powerful because of touching this month
[00:06:58] we have to tie this to Boston tomorrow
[00:07:00] we're using Harvard so imagine this monk
[00:07:02] is studying apartment somewhere on
[00:07:04] campus you can picture a generic
[00:07:05] university an app such as this month and
[00:07:08] yes all right we're getting there the
[00:07:10] next one is Buffalo which was the
[00:07:12] Niagara Falls famous waterfall on the
[00:07:15] border of US and Canada and our next
[00:07:18] line is the separate and equal station
[00:07:20] come to think of separate and equal Ana
[00:07:24] station so I think like a train station
[00:07:26] imagine next to this waterfall separate
[00:07:29] to this waterfall but equal right
[00:07:32] they're both equally regarded as
[00:07:34] interesting things to see right in this
[00:07:37] waterfall you have this separate but
[00:07:40] these cool transitions
[00:07:42] and maybe that transmission goes right
[00:07:44] over the cliffs just like this waterfall
[00:07:46] separate but it's equally interesting
[00:07:49] anticipation next up would move west in
[00:07:52] our little mental map of the United
[00:07:54] States and we're in Chicago I think of
[00:07:56] the piece right there maybe these dish
[00:07:58] Chicago P that's going to be my anchor
[00:08:00] for the city of Chicago and the line I
[00:08:03] have to remember is to which the laws of
[00:08:05] nature again I have the word which so
[00:08:08] I'm to which so I might think of two
[00:08:10] witches let's imagine them inside a
[00:08:12] pizzeria these two witches sitting
[00:08:14] across from each other and they are
[00:08:16] bending the laws of nature to create the
[00:08:20] most amazing pizza in front of them and
[00:08:22] then just scarfing it down they left all
[00:08:24] their having it all chat and Fanjul back
[00:08:26] and forth that which is you to which the
[00:08:29] laws of nature we're getting to the end
[00:08:31] here we're going to keep going west to
[00:08:33] Denver where our picture was a mountain
[00:08:35] of members known as the Mile High City
[00:08:36] near the Rockies so Mountain the next
[00:08:39] line is and of nature's God entitle them
[00:08:43] and this one nature's God and entitled
[00:08:46] entitle them really or what stick out
[00:08:49] picture on top of this mountain is
[00:08:51] nature's go not so god but nature's go
[00:08:54] so maybe to make the difference maybe
[00:08:56] imagine that nature's God is like
[00:08:58] covered in grass and twigs and very tree
[00:09:02] linked and he's giving titles to
[00:09:05] then nature's drawers how about about
[00:09:08] everyone's depending on titles everyone
[00:09:10] and how we move on to Las Vegas right
[00:09:14] lights casinos stress everything and our
[00:09:17] phrase here is a decent respect to the
[00:09:20] opinions of mankind I'm going to
[00:09:22] remember decent respect and opinions of
[00:09:25] mankind
[00:09:26] yeah we're in Vegas we're in Sin City so
[00:09:28] imagine you're at casino people are just
[00:09:30] drinking and gambling people that are
[00:09:33] dressed to the nines
[00:09:34] some are very inappropriate whatever
[00:09:36] it's Vegas right you walk into this
[00:09:38] casino you know you try to give a decent
[00:09:41] respect to everyone you're not judging
[00:09:43] anyone everything in Vegas stays in
[00:09:45] Vegas so you have a decent decent amount
[00:09:47] of respect for you not complete respect
[00:09:50] decent right just enough you're there to
[00:09:53] after all and you're just thinking to
[00:09:56] yourself as you have this piece of
[00:09:57] respect of the opinions of mankind
[00:09:59] you're thinking of all the different
[00:10:01] opinions that mankind would have on what
[00:10:05] you're seeing in this casino so we have
[00:10:07] a decent respect and about these
[00:10:09] opinions of mankind we're the last two
[00:10:13] now we move to LA or the West Coast LA I
[00:10:16] think of like these really tall palm
[00:10:18] trees that they have in LA you know
[00:10:19] think of Beverly Hills and our line here
[00:10:22] is requires that they should declare
[00:10:24] you're going down Beverly Hills there's
[00:10:26] always fancy houses you're seeing
[00:10:28] celebrities palm trees you also see a
[00:10:31] lot of people from other places who are
[00:10:33] all these people they should require
[00:10:35] that they should declare what to do at
[00:10:36] the airport you have something to
[00:10:37] declare or not on this Boulevard is
[00:10:39] Beverly Hills you're going to require a
[00:10:41] set day everyone
[00:10:44] but they should declare maybe declare
[00:10:46] their intentions or maybe declare what
[00:10:47] they brought from their other
[00:10:49] and you're going to require that your
[00:10:50] suddenly the police of that require that
[00:10:53] they should complain and lastly we
[00:10:55] finish up in San Francisco I think San
[00:10:57] Francisco
[00:10:58] I think Golden Gate Bridge line here at
[00:11:00] the last line of that paragraph is the
[00:11:03] causes which impel them to the
[00:11:05] separation what sticks out there is
[00:11:08] causes impel separation let's imagine
[00:11:11] that the bridge is going to separate
[00:11:14] it's very sturdy Burgos only just to
[00:11:17] live and it wants to separate one half
[00:11:19] from the other and so we're thinking as
[00:11:22] outsiders we're looking at this bridge
[00:11:23] insane what are the causes of this
[00:11:25] separation but we want to get the word
[00:11:27] impel so when i look at the word impel
[00:11:29] like the IMP instantly reminds me of
[00:11:31] tyrion lanister from Game of Thrones
[00:11:33] he's often referred to as the infant so
[00:11:35] why is this verse separating the cause
[00:11:36] is because of this attempt he's making
[00:11:39] them separate okay so we've done 11
[00:11:41] lines I'm actually try and go through it
[00:11:43] myself and you can try it along with me
[00:11:45] of course human event becomes necessary
[00:11:48] for one people dissolves political bands
[00:11:52] which connected with assume among the
[00:11:55] powers of the earth is separate and
[00:11:57] equal station to which the laws of
[00:12:01] nature nature's got entitled a decent
[00:12:03] respect in the community requires a big
[00:12:07] causes which impel
[00:12:10] the separation there you go okay so now
[00:12:15] you have that in your mind what you have
[00:12:16] to do now is slowly add the pieces back
[00:12:19] and this is where you study those filler
[00:12:21] words some of those lines we have
[00:12:22] perfect some of them we have maybe 50%
[00:12:24] and some where we have in between right
[00:12:27] what's nice is now I can look at it with
[00:12:28] this text mapped out in my mind with
[00:12:31] this memory palace and remember we use
[00:12:33] the United States memory palaces you can
[00:12:35] use your house you can use a video game
[00:12:37] a movie whatever you want any plates you
[00:12:39] know well that you can navigate through
[00:12:40] you can store the images on locations
[00:12:43] through that journey not just memorize
[00:12:45] first paragraph of Declaration of
[00:12:47] Independence if you want to get really
[00:12:49] good at it you just got a rehearse in
[00:12:50] your head and you get those filler words
[00:12:51] might pick you another 10 minutes that's
[00:12:53] it for today please subscribe like share
[00:12:55] and I'll be back with another video very
[00:12:58] soon thanks for watching love you guys

=== MEMORIZE YOUR FLIGHT CONFIRMATION CODE!! // RANDOM MEMORY TIPS #009 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i4to3ggaVs

[00:00:00] what's up guys Nelson dellis here in
[00:00:02] another random memory tips video and
[00:00:04] this one is going to help you when
[00:00:05] you're traveling how to remember that
[00:00:08] annoying Flight confirmation code that
[00:00:11] six digigit alpha numeric mixture of
[00:00:13] numbers and letters that code that holds
[00:00:16] all the information for your flight
[00:00:17] let's
[00:00:18] [Music]
[00:00:28] go
[00:00:30] [Music]
[00:00:35] I was traveling all day yesterday I was
[00:00:36] away for two weeks climbing check this
[00:00:38] out and I came back and had a whole mess
[00:00:42] of delays and cancellations and had to
[00:00:45] figure out my flight so I was calling
[00:00:46] customer service and I had to know my
[00:00:49] flight confirmation code I got a new one
[00:00:51] I had to remember that one all this
[00:00:52] stuff so I've thought about it many
[00:00:54] times when I show up the airport and I
[00:00:55] have to type in my confirmation code or
[00:00:57] I need to call customer service you got
[00:00:59] to know that six digigit alpha numeric
[00:01:02] number what makes it hard is that it's a
[00:01:04] combination of letters and numbers so
[00:01:07] sometimes some Airlines it might just be
[00:01:09] straight numbers which is easy and you
[00:01:11] can refer to one of my other videos on
[00:01:13] the major system with numbers no problem
[00:01:15] there's two other cases one it's all
[00:01:18] letters I think that's the easiest case
[00:01:19] because it's easier to create words and
[00:01:22] pictures the other scenario is that it's
[00:01:24] a mixture of letters and numbers and
[00:01:26] that's where it gets kind of ugly but
[00:01:29] it's easy still all right so the way to
[00:01:31] do it let's just take an example so the
[00:01:33] one that I got over the phone which I
[00:01:35] had to hold in my head it's
[00:01:37] ax
[00:01:38] GW HC not too bad right it's all letters
[00:01:42] so what am I doing in that process when
[00:01:44] I hear that all I'm doing is taking
[00:01:47] those letters and trying to create words
[00:01:50] that come to mind and then link them
[00:01:52] into a little story now question is how
[00:01:54] many letters am I putting together am I
[00:01:56] coming up with an image for each letter
[00:01:58] no so what I tried to do pair the
[00:02:00] letters it's always nice to have some
[00:02:02] type of structure to your system if I
[00:02:05] said one letter is going to be one word
[00:02:06] and the next two is going to be another
[00:02:08] that's a bit confusing but if I can
[00:02:09] always be consistent 222 that's cool now
[00:02:12] I'll be flexible on this later but for
[00:02:14] now that'll work ax that was easy I
[00:02:16] thought of an axe GW I thought of George
[00:02:20] W former president and so I stiring
[00:02:22] those together I imagine an axe being
[00:02:25] driven into gdb's forehead and then
[00:02:28] finally I had eight C I picture him
[00:02:31] getting an axe to the head and uh he
[00:02:33] sips some high sea juice so that he
[00:02:36] feels better which for some of you who
[00:02:38] don't know what high SE is it's a very
[00:02:40] popular kids Juice drink
[00:02:44] high high now that's well and good but
[00:02:47] we got to do one more step and that's
[00:02:49] anchoring it we're not going to use a
[00:02:50] Memory Palace because it's like a oneoff
[00:02:53] thing we want to be able to remember
[00:02:54] that this is the Flight confirmation
[00:02:56] code for that particular vacation or
[00:03:00] flight in this case I was flying back
[00:03:02] home to Miami so all I got to do is
[00:03:04] picture that little scene happening in
[00:03:06] Miami I think of Miami I think of Miami
[00:03:08] Beach that's where I picture the axe
[00:03:10] going to George W's forehead and him
[00:03:12] drinking highy on the beach again you
[00:03:15] don't have to stick to two letters per
[00:03:16] word you could even do maybe three and
[00:03:18] three recently I had one that was s e m
[00:03:22] u tt which to me I just read it as seut
[00:03:25] so I imagine seeing a mut that one was
[00:03:28] just so easy I didn't have to break it
[00:03:30] up into anything so there's some
[00:03:31] exceptions if you can make it easy just
[00:03:32] go for it another one I had which was
[00:03:36] dy4 jbr but had one number in there I
[00:03:40] split it up Dy made me think of day and
[00:03:43] four so I think of it's day four so jbr
[00:03:47] I kind of grouped together and I
[00:03:48] pictured a jabber Walkie from Allison
[00:03:51] Wonderland which is a madeup beast it's
[00:03:53] not the whole word but jabber jbr
[00:03:55] reminded me of jabber day four I'm
[00:03:57] traveling I'm miserable all this stress
[00:04:00] and there's a jabberwock maybe I'm
[00:04:01] hallucinating crazy monsters on day four
[00:04:04] I was traveling to Italy so maybe on day
[00:04:07] four I'm in the middle of Italy eating
[00:04:09] Bolan pasta whatever and I'm just so
[00:04:12] tired from traveling on day four that I
[00:04:14] see a jabber walkie eating spaghetti
[00:04:17] with me let's say yet half and half
[00:04:20] right like maybe it's a number and a
[00:04:21] letter number and a letter and a number
[00:04:23] and a letter let's take that worst case
[00:04:25] scenario let's say you have 5 a 6 B 7 C
[00:04:31] that's actually not that hard to
[00:04:32] remember because it's 567 and ABC but
[00:04:34] let's say that it's that alternating
[00:04:36] number letter situation what I would do
[00:04:38] is I would mix the major system for the
[00:04:41] number and turn that into a letter and
[00:04:43] then approach it the same as if I had
[00:04:45] just all letters now I know you're going
[00:04:47] to ask how will I remember that they
[00:04:48] were numbers not letters well just trust
[00:04:51] in your memory trust in your brain that
[00:04:53] you saw that it was a mixture of numbers
[00:04:55] and letters and you have to make that
[00:04:56] extra step to translate five remember in
[00:04:59] my system is an l l and a I think of La
[00:05:05] singing 6 B so six is going to be an S
[00:05:09] so SB soab I could think of the word
[00:05:12] soab to
[00:05:15] soab and then finally we have seven and
[00:05:18] G so that's k and a g so I could think
[00:05:21] of a keg I'm singing like an opera la la
[00:05:24] la la la and it's so moving that I sob
[00:05:27] I'm crying and all I need is just a keg
[00:05:29] of be to drown away my sorrows so la
[00:05:32] Saab keg I want to Anchor that to what
[00:05:34] it represents so maybe I'm traveling to
[00:05:37] China on my flight so I'm going to
[00:05:39] picture this scenario happening in China
[00:05:42] okay maybe I'm at the Great Wall of
[00:05:44] China and this is where the Opera is
[00:05:45] happening I sob and I drink from a king
[00:05:48] all right so there you have it it's just
[00:05:49] a mixture of uh the major system and
[00:05:52] being creative with letters and then
[00:05:54] anchoring it to wherever you're
[00:05:55] traveling to all right guys thank you so
[00:05:57] much for watching this video I'm always
[00:05:59] trying to come up with new ideas for
[00:06:01] videos so if you have any suggestions or
[00:06:02] ideas please write them down in the
[00:06:04] comments and I will try to make that
[00:06:06] video for you in the future I already
[00:06:08] have heard some of your requests and I'm
[00:06:10] working on them trust me before I go one
[00:06:12] thing I would ask you to do if you're
[00:06:14] interested in memory and helping out
[00:06:15] some memory research Alzheimer's related
[00:06:18] that's how I got into this memory World
[00:06:20] My Grandmother Had Alzheimer's please
[00:06:21] take this test extrem memory
[00:06:24] challenge.com takes 5 minutes and you're
[00:06:26] helping out with something that I find
[00:06:27] super important thank you subscribe like
[00:06:30] share I'll see you in the next video I'm

=== HOW TO MEMORIZE A (FULL) DECK OF CARDS ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M8qSWk97gA

[00:00:03] [Music]
[00:00:09] what's up guys as promised a few videos
[00:00:12] ago I said I was going to teach you how
[00:00:14] to memorize a full deck of
[00:00:17] cards now's the time we're going to do
[00:00:19] it let's
[00:00:21] [Music]
[00:00:25] go the
[00:00:28] up
[00:00:30] [Music]
[00:00:43] all right so a couple things one the
[00:00:45] technique we're going to use is the
[00:00:46] Memory Palace to store the information
[00:00:48] we learned that in a past video I'll
[00:00:50] link it in the description below but
[00:00:52] make sure you know how to store pictures
[00:00:54] in a Memory Palace woo what I'm going to
[00:00:56] be going over is how to encode all 52
[00:01:00] Cards into a picture cuz that's the hard
[00:01:03] part right how do you turn 52 Cards into
[00:01:06] a picture that you can visualize and
[00:01:08] then store in your memory Palace in the
[00:01:11] last video with the cards we did adjust
[00:01:13] the colors red black all that stuff so
[00:01:15] it's just those two pieces of
[00:01:16] information now we have a suit and a
[00:01:20] number a value to the card so there's 52
[00:01:24] independent things that we need to learn
[00:01:27] to have a picture for now there's a few
[00:01:28] ways to do this this is the one I
[00:01:30] learned when I first started memory
[00:01:31] training and what you learn is I use
[00:01:33] something called p a o person action
[00:01:39] object the first thing we need to do is
[00:01:41] come up with pictures so if I open up a
[00:01:44] deck 52 cards it's a ton of cards now
[00:01:47] what I tell people when they're trying
[00:01:48] to come up with their first pictures for
[00:01:50] the cards is to stick with the face
[00:01:52] cards there's four suits three face
[00:01:54] cards Jack queen king that's 12
[00:01:56] different cards to start with if I
[00:01:59] showed you five random cards could you
[00:02:01] memorize them go ahead
[00:02:03] [Music]
[00:02:08] try yeah that's what I thought when I
[00:02:11] suggest the images to come up with for
[00:02:13] those 12 cards you'll be able to
[00:02:14] memorize those super easy all right so
[00:02:16] let me get all 12 of those face cards
[00:02:18] out of the
[00:02:19] deck and the next thing I'm going to do
[00:02:21] is organize them by their suit this is
[00:02:24] diamonds this is Hearts
[00:02:28] clubs
[00:02:30] cool so once you have all four suits and
[00:02:33] the three face cards for each all lined
[00:02:35] up right in front of you next you want
[00:02:36] to get a piece of paper and a pencil and
[00:02:39] you're going to write the images down
[00:02:40] you're going to come up with people Pao
[00:02:43] person action object so what you need is
[00:02:46] basically to turn these cards into
[00:02:48] people into actions and into objects the
[00:02:50] best place to start is with the people
[00:02:52] because the actions and the objects you
[00:02:53] don't even have to learn them they'll be
[00:02:55] associated with the person you choose so
[00:02:57] all we got to do to start with is find a
[00:02:59] person for every card and in this case
[00:03:01] we're starting with just the face cards
[00:03:03] so the way to do it is just to make it
[00:03:04] as intuitive as possible the way I like
[00:03:07] to break it up is in categories the
[00:03:09] hearts would be one category of people
[00:03:11] diamonds would be another category of
[00:03:12] people the clubs another and Spades
[00:03:15] another my suggestion again you can come
[00:03:16] up with whatever you want but this is
[00:03:18] what I found has worked really well
[00:03:20] Hearts can be family and friends because
[00:03:23] of a heart right you love your friends
[00:03:25] and family that one's easy diamonds can
[00:03:27] be rich people famous people so ities
[00:03:30] they have a lot of money a lot of
[00:03:31] diamonds clubs can be Sports athletes
[00:03:34] because a lot of them use clubs and then
[00:03:36] Spades is kind of like the wild card I
[00:03:38] usually tell people to go with cartoon
[00:03:40] characters Star Wars characters whatever
[00:03:42] you're into maybe make the Spades kind
[00:03:44] of your the thing you're interested in
[00:03:46] that category so starting with the
[00:03:48] hearts the way I like to break them up
[00:03:50] is King of Hearts is your father since
[00:03:52] he's the king of the family Queen of
[00:03:54] Hearts is your mother she's Queen of the
[00:03:55] family and Jack of Hearts can be anybody
[00:03:58] that's not your parents like a pet
[00:04:00] loved one a sibling yourself even these
[00:04:03] are pretty obvious I mean King is your
[00:04:05] dad Queen is your mom and Jack is either
[00:04:07] a sibling or yourself or whatever but if
[00:04:09] you're having trouble coming up with
[00:04:10] people just give a reason why this card
[00:04:14] might represent that person you know
[00:04:15] like a king why would that person be a
[00:04:17] king in your family diamonds maybe think
[00:04:20] of the richest man for King of Diamonds
[00:04:22] maybe Donald Trump now these don't have
[00:04:24] to be people that you love or huge fans
[00:04:26] of they just have to be memorable and
[00:04:28] quick for you to think of when you this
[00:04:29] card so when I think richest person I
[00:04:31] think Donald Trump maybe Bill Gates
[00:04:33] Queen of Diamonds could be a very
[00:04:35] influential female figure maybe opra for
[00:04:38] example and jack of diamonds could be I
[00:04:40] mean we have the J so it could be a
[00:04:42] celebrity a rich celebrity with uh the
[00:04:44] name that starts with Jay Jack Nicholson
[00:04:47] Jack Black King of Clubs here are my
[00:04:49] suggestions King of Clubs could be Tiger
[00:04:51] Woods because he's the king of clubs or
[00:04:54] he used to be Queen of Clubs maybe could
[00:04:57] be Venus or Serena Williams top female
[00:04:59] athlete and then Jack of clubs like to
[00:05:02] think of Jordan Michael Jordans because
[00:05:04] it's a j and then Spades I said that
[00:05:06] these could be your favorite thing movie
[00:05:08] characters let's say Star Wars you're a
[00:05:10] big Star Wars friend so maybe the King
[00:05:12] of Spades could be Luke Skywalker Queen
[00:05:15] of Spades could be Princess Leia and
[00:05:16] then Jack of Spates could be Han
[00:05:25] Solo so you have 12 people right of
[00:05:28] course you're going to have to take some
[00:05:29] time to learn these but the point is we
[00:05:31] tried to make it as instinctive as
[00:05:33] possible so when you're memorizing you
[00:05:34] don't have to think what was this card
[00:05:36] again it should just be natural at least
[00:05:38] for the 12 face cards right the next
[00:05:40] thing you want to do is write down
[00:05:41] actions and objects that are associated
[00:05:44] with those 12 people we just came up
[00:05:46] with that you wrote down the best thing
[00:05:47] to do is to come up with actions that
[00:05:50] are the first thing you think of when
[00:05:51] you think of that person a good example
[00:05:53] let's take the athletes right if we had
[00:05:55] King of Clubs Tiger Woods his action
[00:05:59] swinging a golf club and his object
[00:06:02] would be Golf Club Queen of Clubs we
[00:06:04] said was Serena Williams swinging a
[00:06:06] tennis
[00:06:07] racket object tennis racket Michael
[00:06:10] Jordan dribbling a basketball it's very
[00:06:12] important that all of those actions are
[00:06:15] unique you don't want to share the same
[00:06:17] action with another person because how
[00:06:19] you going to tell it apart from some
[00:06:21] other car note that I had Tiger Woods
[00:06:23] was swinging a golf club and Serena was
[00:06:25] swinging a tennis rord so the action is
[00:06:27] the same verb word swinging but it's two
[00:06:30] different swings it's more like that big
[00:06:33] stroke for the golf and then the swing
[00:06:36] of the racket so in my head there are
[00:06:38] two different movements and that's all
[00:06:40] that matters it's not the word I'm
[00:06:41] memorizing it's the movement the the
[00:06:43] visual that I see in my head okay so
[00:06:46] when you're done with all 12 of those
[00:06:48] person action object then I want you to
[00:06:51] shuffle up those
[00:06:54] cards so you have 12 cards here and I
[00:06:57] want you to try and read out the images
[00:07:01] so what happens is with Pao what you're
[00:07:03] doing and you'll see why I made you come
[00:07:05] up with a person action object is you're
[00:07:07] going to group cards in threes and the
[00:07:09] reason we group cards in threes is
[00:07:11] because it turns 52 cards the whole deck
[00:07:14] into just 17 images so all you have to
[00:07:16] remember are 17 little scenarios or
[00:07:18] little scenes that has a person doing an
[00:07:22] action with a thing so here are some
[00:07:24] examples and this is where it gets fun
[00:07:26] because as you Shuffle the cards those
[00:07:27] are going to get mixed together you're
[00:07:28] going to get some really weird
[00:07:30] combinations but weird
[00:07:33] means Queen of Diamonds we said remember
[00:07:35] diamonds were rich people I suggested
[00:07:37] Oprah okay that's the first card the
[00:07:40] next card I see is the Queen of Hearts
[00:07:42] that's my mom um my action for her is I
[00:07:46] pictur her cooking uh she's makes
[00:07:48] Incredible food um that's what I think
[00:07:51] of when I think of her to jack of
[00:07:52] diamonds I suggested maybe choosing a
[00:07:55] celebrity with the name Jay maybe Johnny
[00:07:57] Deb or maybe James Bond Bond so he's the
[00:08:00] third card in this set so his is an
[00:08:02] object what would James Bond's object be
[00:08:06] could be his Walter pp7 it could be a
[00:08:09] martini glass it could be a tuxedo choic
[00:08:12] is up to you but you got to stick to it
[00:08:14] right for me it's a martini glass so my
[00:08:17] little story here these three cards is
[00:08:21] Oprah cooking a martini glass so I
[00:08:25] literally picture Oprah Winfrey with a
[00:08:27] pot that she's dipping a martini glass
[00:08:30] in as if she's cooking it like it's
[00:08:32] possible that's a really silly image but
[00:08:33] you'll remember it when you finally put
[00:08:35] it all together what you're going to do
[00:08:37] is place that image of Oprah Winfrey
[00:08:40] cooking martini glasses in your memory
[00:08:42] Palace in the first location of your
[00:08:44] memory Palace maybe it's your front door
[00:08:46] there's o free cooking a martini glass
[00:08:48] at your front door then the next two
[00:08:50] cards you move on again repeat the
[00:08:52] process person action object so in this
[00:08:56] case person remember we I suggested that
[00:09:00] this is Serena Williams the tennis
[00:09:02] player King of Diamonds so the rich
[00:09:05] right we had either Bill Gates right so
[00:09:08] what would Bill Gates action be I would
[00:09:10] maybe picture him typing away on a a PC
[00:09:13] or a laptop right and then jackob Hearts
[00:09:16] uh I suggested it be a sibling or
[00:09:17] yourself let's say it's me
[00:09:20] um I like to memorize cards so maybe my
[00:09:23] object is a card so person action object
[00:09:27] we have Serena Williams
[00:09:30] typing
[00:09:31] on a deck of cards and again you place
[00:09:34] that in the next place of your memory
[00:09:36] Palace after you enter the front door
[00:09:38] there is Serena Williams typing away on
[00:09:40] a deck of cards so now you have 12 cards
[00:09:42] what about the rest make sure that
[00:09:44] you're comfortable with all the images
[00:09:46] the person action objects of all those
[00:09:47] 12 cards those face cards Shuffle it try
[00:09:49] to memorize it start there once you got
[00:09:52] that then of course need to remember all
[00:09:55] the number cards and so for that I
[00:09:57] suggest the system so so since we're
[00:10:00] going with categories let's continue so
[00:10:02] the hearts will be friends and family
[00:10:03] people you know clubs will be all
[00:10:05] athletes diamonds will be rich people
[00:10:08] celebrities and Spades can be that
[00:10:10] category that you are a fan of let's in
[00:10:12] my example I had Star Wars characters
[00:10:14] now that's not quite enough because
[00:10:16] you're going to think well how am I
[00:10:17] going to remember that three of diamonds
[00:10:21] you got to have something else now you
[00:10:22] can refer to my major system video
[00:10:25] remember the major system it was a way
[00:10:27] to turn numbers into letters and so what
[00:10:29] you can do is a could be an ace could be
[00:10:32] the letter A if you'd like but think of
[00:10:33] it as a one it's the first card right
[00:10:35] that could be your T right t or d
[00:10:37] remember that was one two would be an N
[00:10:39] three would be an M four an r five an L
[00:10:42] six a sha or soft G sound seven a c or a
[00:10:47] hard G sound eight an F or V nine P or B
[00:10:50] and then 10 you can just think of it as
[00:10:52] like a zero just look at the zero which
[00:10:55] was s or Z if you don't remember that
[00:10:56] whole thing I have a whole video about
[00:10:58] it called the major system check it out
[00:11:00] in the description so what you can do is
[00:11:02] in that category use that letter as the
[00:11:06] CU for the person's name an example here
[00:11:09] let's say seven of diamonds diamonds is
[00:11:11] the category of celebrities right and
[00:11:15] seven is a c or a hard G sound so maybe
[00:11:21] gadoo aka Wonder Woman as an action I
[00:11:25] could easily think of her using that
[00:11:27] lasso and her
[00:11:29] could be a lasso another example ten of
[00:11:32] clubs remember the 10 is an s or z sound
[00:11:36] because of the Zero from our major
[00:11:38] system and then clubs is a sports
[00:11:40] athlete person so someone with an s that
[00:11:43] sticks out of my mind maybe Steph Curry
[00:11:46] now I know we already had a basketball
[00:11:47] player Jack of clubs we had as Michael
[00:11:49] Jordan
[00:11:51] dribbling basketball so make sure if you
[00:11:54] have another basketball player you're
[00:11:55] not choosing the same action or object
[00:11:57] right so Steph Curry I'm going to have
[00:11:59] to think of something else that I think
[00:12:01] of when I think of him I think of him
[00:12:02] shooting three into a hoop so maybe his
[00:12:05] action is shooting a basketball and his
[00:12:08] object is the hoop itself and one more
[00:12:11] example just to spread it across Spades
[00:12:14] I said was Star Wars characters again
[00:12:16] that's optional four is the letter R I
[00:12:19] think of R2-D2 that's going to be the
[00:12:22] four of Spades what would his action and
[00:12:24] object be making beeping sounds his
[00:12:27] object could be an X-Wing not the plane
[00:12:29] that he goes into it's R2-D2 making
[00:12:32] beeping sounds X-Wing Fighter
[00:12:35] [Music]
[00:12:51] plane oh it's pretty at the
[00:12:54] end

=== HOW TO MEMORIZE A DECK OF CARDS (COLORS ONLY) // RANDOM MEMORY TIPS #006 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOukDvkTfg0

[00:00:02] [Music]
[00:00:06] welcome to another episode of random
[00:00:08] memory tips and in today's episode I'm
[00:00:11] going to teach you how to memorize a
[00:00:15] deck of cards
[00:00:18] [Music]
[00:00:35] well the colors of a deck of cards at
[00:00:37] least we'll start there and then in a
[00:00:39] future video I'll do the whole thing how
[00:00:41] to do a proper full deck of card suits
[00:00:43] and everything cool all
[00:00:47] [Music]
[00:00:51] right there you are what's up let's go
[00:00:53] find a place to sit down and have a
[00:00:56] chat look at this beautiful weather so
[00:01:00] we're going to talk about how to
[00:01:02] remember a deck of playing cards which
[00:01:04] is kind of like the ultimate cool trick
[00:01:07] to show with your memory and while for a
[00:01:09] lot of you that may not be of interest I
[00:01:11] what what am I going to do with a party
[00:01:12] trick I will say that memorizing a deck
[00:01:14] of cards is one of the best daily
[00:01:17] exercises you can do for improving your
[00:01:19] memory all right so how do you memorize
[00:01:20] a deck of cards so we're going to go
[00:01:22] over the simplest form which is to
[00:01:24] memorize just the colors red black black
[00:01:26] red we're not going to worry ourselves
[00:01:28] with the value of the the card that'll
[00:01:30] be another video now the very first
[00:01:32] thing we need to develop is an encoding
[00:01:35] system some way to translate these
[00:01:37] colors into something we can visualize
[00:01:40] so red black black black red red red
[00:01:42] black red black whatever that's not easy
[00:01:45] to visualize if it's 52 cards of
[00:01:48] combinations of red and black that can
[00:01:49] get very difficult very fast so what
[00:01:52] we're going to do is imagine that these
[00:01:55] red blacks are like binary numbers now
[00:01:57] if you're not familiar with binary
[00:01:58] numbers that's B basically just one and
[00:02:01] a zero it's basically when there's two
[00:02:03] states of anything think of light
[00:02:05] switches on or off male or female in
[00:02:08] this case we have red and
[00:02:11] black we'll take groups of three cards
[00:02:14] and for every triplet combination we
[00:02:17] will come up with a letter there are
[00:02:19] only eight possibilities red red red red
[00:02:22] red black red black red red black black
[00:02:25] black red red black red black black
[00:02:28] black red and black black black there we
[00:02:31] go if you think about it three take 52
[00:02:33] cards and split it in three it's
[00:02:35] basically 17 different letters with a
[00:02:38] card left over we're going to take that
[00:02:39] even further we're going to create a
[00:02:40] three-letter word okay it's a one
[00:02:43] syllable three-letter word so like Bob
[00:02:45] or kick or Duke or dad and you can
[00:02:48] imagine these three letters each
[00:02:51] represent three cards it's nine cards
[00:02:53] you suddenly have the information for
[00:02:55] with just that one little syllable word
[00:02:57] Bob the next thing to do is to learn
[00:02:59] that system so so I'm going to pass it
[00:03:00] over to Nelson over here to explain to
[00:03:02] you that encoding system Nelson okay so
[00:03:05] basically we're going to have triplets
[00:03:06] of cards combination of red and black
[00:03:09] and the first set of three is going to
[00:03:11] be a consonant the second set is going
[00:03:12] to be a vowel and the third will be a
[00:03:14] consonant again so we need a consonant
[00:03:16] vowel for each set red red red will be B
[00:03:19] red red black C red black red d red
[00:03:23] black black F black red red G black red
[00:03:27] black L black black red and black black
[00:03:30] black m we're going to group some of
[00:03:32] these similar sounds together and now
[00:03:35] the vowels remember we're just going for
[00:03:36] the vowel sounds so for example red red
[00:03:39] red would be uh as in book red red black
[00:03:44] would be I as in hit red black red would
[00:03:48] be a as in bat red black black would be
[00:03:51] uh as in Duck and so on the idea is
[00:03:55] we're going to group three groups of
[00:03:57] three to construct a con vowel consonant
[00:04:01] to make a short one syllable
[00:04:05] word at some point just pause this
[00:04:08] screen and just Commit This to
[00:04:13] Memory here's an example if we have red
[00:04:16] black red that's a d or a t black black
[00:04:18] red that's a e sound and black black
[00:04:20] black that's an m so we either have team
[00:04:23] or de
[00:04:25] cool all right now that you have that
[00:04:28] system we can Shuffle this deck of cards
[00:04:31] and let's do an example
[00:04:33] together shuffler such an amazing
[00:04:36] shuffler all right so we got this deck
[00:04:38] of cards I just shuffled I'm going to go
[00:04:39] through it for the first time I haven't
[00:04:40] seen it and show you what words come up
[00:04:43] and what we do with them six words six
[00:04:45] short little one syllable words I think
[00:04:47] you just come up with a little story a
[00:04:49] little linking method thing nothing
[00:04:51] complicated all right the way I'm going
[00:04:52] through it is I'm starting at the bottom
[00:04:54] and working my way to the back okay so I
[00:04:57] start with the first three and I'm going
[00:04:58] to read it from left to right okay just
[00:05:01] like a book The blacks are ones and the
[00:05:03] reds are zeros here we have three blacks
[00:05:06] right we're going to do consonant vowel
[00:05:08] consonant three that's an m i look at
[00:05:10] the next three which is red black red
[00:05:13] which is going to be a vowel and it's
[00:05:14] the a sound the next three it's 001
[00:05:17] which is going to be C sound so I have a
[00:05:20] Mac Mac think of like a Mac Pro moving
[00:05:23] on to the next word b e sound and this
[00:05:26] next one red black red that's a t or d
[00:05:29] sound so I'm going to think of beat Mac
[00:05:32] beat so maybe I'm my MacBook Pro and I'm
[00:05:34] making some beats next we have an Li i f
[00:05:39] life I got Mac beat life making mac
[00:05:42] beats and this is my life this is like
[00:05:44] what I do the next one is an N O C Sound
[00:05:47] again so knock Mac beats for life and
[00:05:50] then someone knocks on the door here
[00:05:52] next we have red black red that's a d u
[00:05:55] sound another C sound so let's imagine a
[00:05:57] juke like a Regal English Duke so we
[00:06:01] have mac beats for life and knocking on
[00:06:04] the door is Duke and finally we have
[00:06:06] seven cards left which is kind of weird
[00:06:08] so what I'm going to do is take a a
[00:06:10] consonant for the first three a vowel
[00:06:12] for the second three and then I'll just
[00:06:14] imagine this is either one of our first
[00:06:17] two letters right we had the zero or the
[00:06:19] one the zero was the B and the one was
[00:06:21] the K so if I get a red that's a b if I
[00:06:24] get a black it's going to be the C Sound
[00:06:26] that's pretty easy so it's technically
[00:06:28] my sixth picture here I have a c an i
[00:06:30] and then the black card last remember I
[00:06:32] said is a c as well so I have kick in
[00:06:36] short we have mac beat for Life someone
[00:06:39] knocks on the door it's a Juke and he
[00:06:40] kicks the door
[00:06:42] down that's easy you have a full deck of
[00:06:45] 52 cards that will impress the pants off
[00:06:47] of anyone so all you have to do now with
[00:06:49] those words is be able to translate it
[00:06:51] back to the binary the red black Reds
[00:06:54] our first word was Mac right so remember
[00:06:57] an M was black black black the a sound
[00:07:01] was red black red the C Sound was red
[00:07:06] red black now the only thing you have to
[00:07:08] be careful with here is because we read
[00:07:10] it like a book right each triplet that's
[00:07:13] not technically the right order right if
[00:07:14] I say the first one was an M was black
[00:07:17] black black black black black that's
[00:07:19] fine the next one's actually fine as
[00:07:21] well red black red reads both ways but
[00:07:24] this one I said it was red red black but
[00:07:26] I'm reading it from left to right
[00:07:28] technically if I'm recalling everything
[00:07:30] in order this way I better say black red
[00:07:32] red so whatever you have in your mind
[00:07:34] just reverse it that's easy so I said
[00:07:36] red red black so it's actually black red
[00:07:39] red then beats was the second word right
[00:07:42] so a b was red red red e sound was black
[00:07:47] black red but again I have to say that
[00:07:50] backwards so red black black if I want
[00:07:52] to say it sequentially say somebody's
[00:07:53] testing on you I need to say it
[00:07:54] backwards beat T sound was red black red
[00:07:58] and again this one's palindromic so you
[00:08:00] don't need to worry about taking it
[00:08:02] backwards and so on and there you have
[00:08:03] your deck good luck with that I'm going
[00:08:05] to go enjoy this weather and skateboard
[00:08:07] home I'll see you in the next video

=== MEMORIZING FOREIGN WORDS ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjk5nBtqM3c

[00:00:00] what's up everyone here is another
[00:00:02] episode of random memory tips and in
[00:00:05] this episode I'm going to teach you how
[00:00:07] to
[00:00:08] remember language
[00:00:11] [Music]
[00:00:22] vocabulary how's everyone doing so last
[00:00:25] weekend I got the privilege of speaking
[00:00:27] at Silicon Valley ComicCon this had to
[00:00:30] focus on Tech so there was the comic
[00:00:32] side of things which was fun and
[00:00:34] entertaining to watch everybody dressing
[00:00:36] up and then the other part of it was
[00:00:37] Tech related which pulled in different
[00:00:40] companies a lot in the Space and Science
[00:00:43] realm so I got to meet a lot of these
[00:00:45] people I got to meet Buzz Aldren Adam
[00:00:47] Savage from MythBusters but probably the
[00:00:49] best discussion I had was this woman
[00:00:51] that I spoke to who was the inspiration
[00:00:54] for Amy Adams character in the movie
[00:00:56] arrival if you haven't seen it go check
[00:00:58] it out very cool movie about aliens
[00:01:01] arriving Amy Adams plays a linguist
[00:01:03] someone who studies languages this
[00:01:05] scientist was at the ComicCon and I got
[00:01:08] the opportunity to speak with her and we
[00:01:10] got to talking about languages and it
[00:01:11] reminded me of one of the common
[00:01:13] questions I get is can you speak
[00:01:15] multiple
[00:01:17] languages the answer is yes I speak
[00:01:20] French fluently and English and a little
[00:01:22] bit of Spanish enough to get by but I
[00:01:25] wouldn't say that I'm a polyglot or
[00:01:26] anyone who just absorbs languages and in
[00:01:29] fact to learn a lang language is a hard
[00:01:30] thing it's not just memory people ask me
[00:01:33] can you memorize a language and yes I
[00:01:35] could memorize a lot of vocabulary very
[00:01:38] quickly which you need to have in order
[00:01:40] to speak a language but I'd still need
[00:01:42] to practice to learn the vocab it's not
[00:01:45] so simple as just memorizing the nice
[00:01:47] thing about memorizing foreign language
[00:01:48] words is you don't need a Memory Palace
[00:01:51] it's all about linking so what do I mean
[00:01:53] by
[00:01:53] linking there's the Memory Palace
[00:01:55] technique which I've talked about in
[00:01:57] past videos go check them out if you
[00:01:58] haven't then there's this kind of like
[00:02:00] technique that's not as powerful as the
[00:02:02] Memory Palace method it has certain
[00:02:04] strengths that only the linking method
[00:02:06] has and I'll go over linking method uh
[00:02:09] for long lists in another video the
[00:02:11] basics of this linking method is taking
[00:02:13] one image and linking it to another
[00:02:16] image a foreign word and it's English
[00:02:19] translation foreign word English word
[00:02:22] boom basically imagine the one thing
[00:02:25] whatever it sounds like whatever it
[00:02:26] reminds you of some picture for it come
[00:02:28] up with a picture for the second thing
[00:02:30] and imagine them interacting together
[00:02:32] that's linking taking these two images
[00:02:34] and smashing them together so when I was
[00:02:36] talking to this Amy Adams character I
[00:02:38] brought up something that I've always
[00:02:39] thought was kind of interesting and that
[00:02:41] is that to my knowledge the best of my
[00:02:43] knowledge the word
[00:02:45] butterfly is unique in every language at
[00:02:49] least almost all of them I'm going to
[00:02:51] teach you 10 different ways to say the
[00:02:53] word butterfly the point is to take 10
[00:02:55] different examples see how I would go
[00:02:57] about turning it into a picture and
[00:02:59] linking them together together so that
[00:03:00] you can take those examples and apply
[00:03:02] them to whatever language that you want
[00:03:04] okay nice all right so you know the
[00:03:06] first one that's butterfly in English
[00:03:08] number two we're going to talk about
[00:03:10] French and the word for that is papon
[00:03:13] the sound is papon I think of a puppy on
[00:03:18] something puppy on something so our left
[00:03:21] hand image the English image for
[00:03:23] butterfly is going to be the actual
[00:03:25] butterfly okay and then the foreign
[00:03:27] language is going to be the thing we
[00:03:29] kind of ad lib in this case we have a
[00:03:32] puppy on then we're going to mash them
[00:03:34] together right so I'm going to picture a
[00:03:35] puppy on top of a butterfly okay to
[00:03:40] remember that this was the French
[00:03:41] language uh papon papy on what we should
[00:03:44] do is add some element of French what's
[00:03:47] something French right that you think of
[00:03:48] so a puppy on a butterfly maybe give
[00:03:51] this puppy a little mustache a little
[00:03:54] Beret and a striped shirt puppy on a
[00:03:58] butterfly so let's move on to the the
[00:03:59] next word we're going to learn how to
[00:04:01] say butterfly in Spanish the word for
[00:04:03] that is Marosa so the image for that is
[00:04:06] going to be marry pose so you're getting
[00:04:09] married and this is the pose you take
[00:04:12] whatever ridiculous pose you want to
[00:04:14] imagine you're there at the end of the
[00:04:16] aisle about to get married and you
[00:04:18] strike a pose with a beautiful butterfly
[00:04:20] on your finger so it's your Merry pose
[00:04:23] to help you remember that it's Spanish
[00:04:25] just imagine this wedding decoration
[00:04:27] these bull fighter outfits and and uh
[00:04:30] there's these Spanish Flags draped
[00:04:32] everywhere toplas is being served at
[00:04:34] this wedding and you're doing your Mary
[00:04:36] pose uh with that butterfly okay that's
[00:04:39] our third one all right next one's a
[00:04:41] good one it's
[00:04:43] Italian the way to say butterfly in
[00:04:46] Italian is farala which if you're
[00:04:48] familiar with pastas farala is the one
[00:04:51] that looks like a butterfly if you've
[00:04:54] never had that pasta before then let's
[00:04:56] come up with an image the way it kind of
[00:04:57] reads it looks like a far fall someone
[00:05:00] is falling very far Italy is known for
[00:05:02] its beautiful coastlines often off the
[00:05:05] cliffs they've built these beautiful
[00:05:07] Villages of course we got to tie it back
[00:05:09] to a butterfly somehow so maybe you
[00:05:11] think you're a butterfly and you jump
[00:05:13] off this Cliff this beautiful Italian
[00:05:15] Coastline cliff and uh it's a farf fall
[00:05:18] and you Plum it into the
[00:05:21] ocean okay Dutch here's how to say
[00:05:24] butterfly in Dutch it's blender it kind
[00:05:26] of sounds like a blender so I'm going to
[00:05:28] picture putting a butterfly in a blender
[00:05:31] maybe a ton of butterflies in a blender
[00:05:33] and it just makes this smoothie of
[00:05:36] butterflies let's tie it back to Dutch
[00:05:39] windmills right they're famous windmills
[00:05:41] so maybe this blender is just a big
[00:05:44] windmill right with a cup on top of it
[00:05:47] and that's where you're putting in the
[00:05:48] butterflies it just spins like it
[00:05:49] normally does and uh you have this
[00:05:52] blender blender vender vender blender of
[00:05:56] uh butterflies this is my favorite one
[00:05:59] just just because all the other ones
[00:06:01] sound very beautiful they're short
[00:06:03] they're kind of cute German of course uh
[00:06:05] is pretty harsh but it's a good one it's
[00:06:07] fun to say and the word for butterfly in
[00:06:09] German is schlink I don't know if I'm
[00:06:12] saying that correct but schlink here's
[00:06:14] where sometimes you have to take
[00:06:16] liberties with the image for the word it
[00:06:18] doesn't always have to be exactly close
[00:06:20] to it so I'm going to go with and hear
[00:06:23] me out butter I'm going to imagine
[00:06:26] shmear butter right that helps me get
[00:06:28] that kind of sound so I have this
[00:06:31] schmeared butter schmutter maybe let's
[00:06:34] imagine their sausage links specifically
[00:06:36] brat worst or some uh really serious
[00:06:39] German sausage right so this butterfly
[00:06:43] is shmear butter all over these links
[00:06:46] and they're German
[00:06:47] sausages Portuguese boreta I'm going to
[00:06:50] imagine there's a barb wire fence and
[00:06:52] someone is letting me through it so
[00:06:55] barolette barbwire let who's letting me
[00:06:57] in of course it's a nice big butterfly
[00:07:00] who's standing guard and we have to tie
[00:07:01] that back to Portuguese somehow I think
[00:07:04] of Brazil it's just sing while he lets
[00:07:06] you through the barb wire next is Danish
[00:07:09] the word for butterfly in Danish is
[00:07:11] summer Fugal what it makes me think of
[00:07:13] is a summer summertime I think of The
[00:07:16] Bugle chips that you put on your fingers
[00:07:18] little cone shaped things and you eat
[00:07:19] them off right you're in the grass sun
[00:07:21] is out it's a beautiful summer day and
[00:07:23] maybe a butterfly comes and eats each
[00:07:25] one off your finger maybe the butterfly
[00:07:27] lands on your hand and then asks you hey
[00:07:30] I don't eat bugles uh do you have any
[00:07:32] danishes that way you can tie it back to
[00:07:35] it being from Denmark Danish okay so
[00:07:37] finish pear honin the picture I think of
[00:07:39] a pear the fruit that's honing in on
[00:07:41] something this pear is honing in on a
[00:07:44] butterfly we have to tie this to Finland
[00:07:47] or finish somehow so maybe this pear is
[00:07:49] honing in on that butterfly to finish
[00:07:52] him you maybe you can hear that Mortal
[00:07:53] Kombat sound finish him finish him
[00:07:56] finally is Russian and the way to say
[00:07:58] that is
[00:08:00] his babe says ouch he's being pricked or
[00:08:02] something at the doctor and then he goes
[00:08:05] I'm okay babe ouch okay it's not quite
[00:08:09] right but if you keep those syllables in
[00:08:12] your mind you can probably get the word
[00:08:14] boska close enough a butterfly comes and
[00:08:17] maybe that's who administers the prick a
[00:08:20] little pinch uh maybe they drawing blood
[00:08:23] or giving a vaccine this butterfly does
[00:08:25] it and the Babe goes ouch and um then
[00:08:29] he's like K not a big deal for the word
[00:08:32] Russia I think of rushing something
[00:08:34] rushed right so maybe this is a really
[00:08:37] rushed visual right so this babe
[00:08:39] suddenly gets pricked by a butterfly
[00:08:41] ouch okay really rushed all right that's
[00:08:44] all 10 languages how to say butterfly
[00:08:47] I'm going to take 30 seconds to distract
[00:08:49] your brain and then we'll come back and
[00:08:50] see if you can remember them I'm going
[00:08:52] to show you some highlights of my trip
[00:08:54] to Silicon Valley Comic-Con it's pretty
[00:08:56] interesting here we go we'll come back
[00:08:57] and I'll test you
[00:08:59] [Music]
[00:09:15] [Music]
[00:09:28] all right so oh here we go
[00:09:31] English butterfly obviously
[00:09:37] French
[00:09:38] Spanish
[00:09:41] Mariposa Italian
[00:09:45] farala
[00:09:47] Dutch
[00:09:49] vinder
[00:09:51] German
[00:09:54] schmink
[00:09:56] Portuguese borboleta
[00:10:01] Danish summer
[00:10:04] Fugal
[00:10:06] Finnish per
[00:10:08] honen and Russian babka anyways I hope
[00:10:13] this helps a little bit I'm sure in
[00:10:15] future videos we'll talk more about
[00:10:16] learning vocab for languages but this
[00:10:18] one was just to give you a little taste
[00:10:20] of how to do it with simple word and
[00:10:22] different languages and to teach you the
[00:10:25] basics of the linking method take one
[00:10:28] item link it to the next
[00:10:29] like this video subscribe leave comments
[00:10:32] if you have any questions or suggestions
[00:10:34] for future videos I'll be back with
[00:10:36] another random memory tip video in no
[00:10:38] time I'm out

[00:04:18] you can see that camp over there some
[00:04:21] climbers before they go climb ever look
[00:04:24] whoosh a big peak over there we want
[00:04:29] it's a personal choice by the guides so
[00:04:35] Everest if we wind up see that wall of
[00:04:40] mountains that's the end of the valley
[00:04:42] and if you go to the right that's where
[00:04:45] you enter the western Combe which is the
[00:04:50] glacier the mouth of Mount Everest
[00:04:53] so all this down here is the very very
[00:04:57] beginning of the Everest glacier
[00:05:02] that's where it leads to and here is
[00:05:04] little shy very hungry this is the mouth
[00:05:12] of the Everest glacier you can see in
[00:05:15] the very far distance that's base camp
[00:05:16] where all the white snowy stuff is the I
[00:05:18] see stuff that moves every day six feet
[00:05:22] a day all the way down the upper silesia
[00:05:25] almost a gorg Shep and then another hour
[00:05:27] to base camp this is the last outpost
[00:05:31] before base camp Green get a little
[00:05:34] Danish pastry rest and then they go ass
[00:05:39] our truck is a Basecamp home for the
[00:05:43] next month and a half
[00:05:44] there's Basecamp all the way and here's
[00:05:48] the deadly Icefall man I think we're
[00:05:51] somewhere over there clearly we're down
[00:05:53] here cross over

=== HOW TO REMEMBER NAMES (an introduction and simple tips) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK7kfE6SuJs

[00:00:00] what's up everyone welcome to another
[00:00:01] episode of random memory tips and in
[00:00:04] this episode we are gonna talk about how
[00:00:07] to remember names and faces so how many
[00:00:18] of you out there think you have an
[00:00:20] especially poor memory for names and
[00:00:23] faces probably a lot of you that's
[00:00:26] probably the number one request I get is
[00:00:29] Nelson how do I remember the names and
[00:00:34] faces of people I meet everybody seems
[00:00:36] to struggle with names and faces but why
[00:00:38] here's the thing the problem with
[00:00:39] remembering people's names and faces one
[00:00:41] is that we're always on the move right
[00:00:43] when we meet people it's either really
[00:00:45] quick it's maybe really loud the social
[00:00:48] situation actually dictates how easy or
[00:00:51] difficult it is to remember someone's
[00:00:53] name and because there's people involved
[00:00:56] we're often too embarrassed to ask for
[00:00:58] the name multiple times or to follow up
[00:01:01] and really learn the prisons name if we
[00:01:03] missed it or just forgotten really quick
[00:01:05] but here's a cool thing when I started
[00:01:07] memory techniques I had a bad memory and
[00:01:09] especially a bad memory
[00:01:11] in names and faces that was one of my
[00:01:12] worst kills turns out that after a
[00:01:14] number of years of practice I managed to
[00:01:16] become the top memorizer of names in the
[00:01:19] entire country and when I do speeches I
[00:01:22] frequently will remember the whole room
[00:01:24] and go around picking people off telling
[00:01:26] them what their name was and I only got
[00:01:28] to meet them for a matter of seconds
[00:01:30] beforehand I tell you that so that you
[00:01:33] can realize that someone didn't have a
[00:01:35] good memory especially with names can
[00:01:37] turn into someone who is really good at
[00:01:39] remembering names anyways I have five
[00:01:43] steps that I always follow when
[00:01:45] memorizing names I'm gonna share them
[00:01:46] with you
[00:01:48] alright step 1 pay attention I already
[00:01:51] alluded to this beforehand but you
[00:01:53] always have to pay attention remembering
[00:01:55] anything especially names will not
[00:01:58] happen unless your mind is ready to
[00:02:01] remember this person's name an easy
[00:02:03] little tip here to get your mind primed
[00:02:05] to remember someone's face is walk into
[00:02:08] the situation whether it's a meeting or
[00:02:11] you're walking into a party or someone's
[00:02:13] about to introduce you in your mind tell
[00:02:16] yourself the following phrase I want to
[00:02:18] remember this person's name that's it if
[00:02:20] you just did that step alone and didn't
[00:02:23] even bother with the next word I'm gonna
[00:02:24] share you would have a better memory for
[00:02:26] names pay attention all right step 2 is
[00:02:30] to choose a feature most people might
[00:02:32] say choose a feature on the person's
[00:02:34] face try to choose something that
[00:02:36] doesn't change like don't use glasses
[00:02:39] don't use earrings I think choose
[00:02:40] whatever you notice first if it is a
[00:02:43] pair of glasses if it's a mole if it's
[00:02:45] their bushy eyebrows it's their crazy
[00:02:48] red curly hair even if it's a funny
[00:02:50] shirt with a seagull on it with a hat
[00:02:51] just choose it it can even be more vague
[00:02:54] than that it could be like the way that
[00:02:55] they walked manner in which they move
[00:02:58] their hands what's important to this is
[00:02:59] to choose something that you just
[00:03:01] naturally noticed and that popped out at
[00:03:03] you first why because that's probably
[00:03:05] what's going to pop out at you the next
[00:03:07] time you see them alright step 3
[00:03:09] take their name and turn it into a
[00:03:11] picture you know you've mentally primed
[00:03:12] yourself you've chosen a future and now
[00:03:14] you're going in for the handshake now
[00:03:16] you take that word and you have to turn
[00:03:18] that into a picture so the first thing
[00:03:20] you want to do is say to yourself when
[00:03:21] you hear the name what does it remind me
[00:03:23] of if I heard Bob for me I would think
[00:03:25] a sieve off so this round Bob thing in
[00:03:29] the water bouncing up and down step four
[00:03:31] now this is the crucial step this is
[00:03:33] what will cement that name into your
[00:03:35] memory that is where you intertwine
[00:03:37] steps two and three where you take the
[00:03:39] feature you take the image and you just
[00:03:42] match them together
[00:03:44] it matches the picture interacting or
[00:03:47] living or be on that feature so the
[00:03:50] final step now is step number five this
[00:03:53] is where you can consolidate all that
[00:03:55] information and try to push it into your
[00:03:57] long-term memory Step five is to review
[00:04:00] my review I mean make an extra effort to
[00:04:03] think about or test yourself on this
[00:04:06] person's name the key to having
[00:04:08] something ingrained into your long-term
[00:04:09] memory is review unfortunately that is
[00:04:12] always gonna be the case the techniques
[00:04:14] one through four will get you very very
[00:04:16] far but if you won't have an incredible
[00:04:18] memory where you meet someone a year
[00:04:20] later and you remember their names and
[00:04:22] you just wow them that's where a bit of
[00:04:23] review comes in to review we have those
[00:04:25] five steps the first one was to pay
[00:04:27] attention the second one was choose a
[00:04:30] feature the third one was apps for the
[00:04:32] name that come up with a picture for
[00:04:33] that name or is to match the name and
[00:04:35] the feature together and then five is
[00:04:38] review I want to do some examples I'm
[00:04:40] gonna have you memorize the names of
[00:04:41] faces of five different English bulldogs
[00:04:44] why English bulldogs well because they
[00:04:47] have such funny faces and one thing I
[00:04:49] want to prove to you is that ideally
[00:04:50] with these five steps you could do this
[00:04:52] for plants you could do this for dogs
[00:04:54] you could do this for any other animal
[00:04:56] you could do this for a bar of soap but
[00:04:58] of course you're gonna want to use it
[00:04:59] for real-life people but you can do it
[00:05:01] for the other kinds of things that are a
[00:05:03] bit crazy and you
[00:05:04] awesome memory when it comes time to
[00:05:06] memorize a person's name
[00:05:08] ready
[00:05:10] all right so our first Bulldog is gonna
[00:05:13] be this guy though I might choose for
[00:05:16] example on this guy's left ear so I'm
[00:05:19] gonna choose that location his his brown
[00:05:21] ear there this guy's name is Brian so we
[00:05:24] need to turn the name Brian into a image
[00:05:27] Brian I think of a brain
[00:05:29] Brian brain close enough so what I'll do
[00:05:32] is as I will plop a pink brush out of
[00:05:36] the skull brain on this bull dogs left
[00:05:40] ear that's brown that's it all right so
[00:05:42] the second dog is this guy okay kind of
[00:05:46] older much more droopy er and in this
[00:05:49] case the feature I'm gonna choose for
[00:05:51] this dog is the fact that his jowls are
[00:05:54] really really droopy and his name is
[00:05:56] Edward when I think of Edward I think of
[00:05:59] an award
[00:06:00] Edward Ward Edward award it's close
[00:06:03] right so maybe this dog gets the award
[00:06:06] for being the drew piest
[00:06:07] face dog in the history of dog kind
[00:06:11] here's our next dog all right and the
[00:06:15] first thing I notice about this dog is
[00:06:16] that little snaggletooth that kind of
[00:06:19] pops out on the left there so this dog's
[00:06:21] name is it's a girl her name is Janis
[00:06:24] all I see in this word or here in this
[00:06:26] word is nice okay so I'm gonna picture
[00:06:28] that even though she has a snaggletooth
[00:06:29] you know it's kind of menacing showing
[00:06:32] that tooth she's the nicest dog that
[00:06:34] I've ever met so with the snaggletooth
[00:06:36] you know you think she'd bite maybe with
[00:06:38] that sharp tooth but in fact she's
[00:06:39] actually really nice our next dog super
[00:06:43] cute dog
[00:06:43] and the first thing I noticed is this
[00:06:44] dog's tongue just hanging out and this
[00:06:47] dog's name is Leah when I think of the
[00:06:49] name Leah I think of Princess Leia so
[00:06:52] when I think of Princess Leia I think of
[00:06:53] those two buns of hair that she has on
[00:06:56] her ears so I'm gonna put those two buns
[00:06:59] on this dog and she's leaving these buns
[00:07:01] that are on the side of her head like
[00:07:03] Princess Leia our last dog here he is
[00:07:05] I'm gonna choose over his nose he kind
[00:07:08] of has a more pronounced unusual fold of
[00:07:11] skin right there so I'm gonna choose
[00:07:12] that as his feature his name
[00:07:14] is Philip Philip sounds like I'm gonna
[00:07:17] fill something up and we can imagine
[00:07:19] filling up that little strip of folded
[00:07:23] skin and maybe it's being filled up with
[00:07:25] water or some of those filled up with
[00:07:27] water right there that's it alright so
[00:07:30] now let's do a quick test I'm going to
[00:07:32] show you these five dogs out of order
[00:07:34] and I'll give you a second to say the
[00:07:35] name out loud and then I'll reveal the
[00:07:37] answer here we go so that's it guys
[00:08:04] that's how to remember names just stick
[00:08:06] to those five tips when you're in a
[00:08:08] social situation and I promise you you
[00:08:11] will improve the important thing with
[00:08:12] names and faces is to try so often we
[00:08:15] don't try anymore because we have these
[00:08:17] devices that can do it for us or we
[00:08:19] simply are too busy with ourselves or
[00:08:21] other things that we don't even take the
[00:08:23] time to try and learn a person's name so
[00:08:25] take that time make the effort use that
[00:08:27] little thing it's inside your head and
[00:08:29] try to memorize people you meet that's
[00:08:32] it for now I'll see you in the next
[00:08:34] video
[00:08:34] thanks for watching

=== THE MAJOR SYSTEM (MEMORIZING NUMBERS) // RANDOM MEMORY TIPS #003 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJGMXUJCB-4

[00:00:00] what up everyone welcome to another
[00:00:02] memory tips video my name is Nelson DS
[00:00:04] four time USA memory champion and in
[00:00:06] this video I'm going to be teaching you
[00:00:09] how to
[00:00:10] remember
[00:00:13] [Music]
[00:00:17] numbers so the thing with numbers is
[00:00:20] that they're hard a lot of people have
[00:00:22] difficulty remembering numbers for some
[00:00:24] reason is because numbers are so
[00:00:27] abstract right they're these symbols
[00:00:29] that represent a number but beyond that
[00:00:32] they're kind of just a symbol
[00:00:33] individually these symbols these numbers
[00:00:36] are meaningless so the goal with numbers
[00:00:39] first and foremost is to give numbers
[00:00:42] meaning well how do we do that
[00:00:44] Nelson I'm going to show you viewer the
[00:00:48] first thing we need to memorize numbers
[00:00:50] is a system we need some way of
[00:00:53] converting those difficult abstract
[00:00:55] symbols digits numbers into something
[00:00:58] that we can process and then turn into
[00:01:00] something that we can imagine or
[00:01:01] visualize and the easiest things to
[00:01:03] visualize are words so we need a system
[00:01:06] that will turn numbers into words and to
[00:01:09] be able to construct words we need
[00:01:10] letters so I have the perfect system for
[00:01:12] you you'll be memorizing numbers in no
[00:01:14] time I'm going to need some tools let's
[00:01:18] [Music]
[00:01:27] go this is something called the major
[00:01:31] system what it'll do is turn each digit
[00:01:35] 0 through 9 into a consonant
[00:01:41] sound zero is an s or a z sound one is a
[00:01:46] t or a D sound two is an N three M four
[00:01:52] is an r five is an L six J
[00:02:00] CH soft G sound seven is a k c or hard G
[00:02:09] sound8 is an F or a v n is a p or a B so
[00:02:15] you need to memorize this first let's
[00:02:17] start with zero that's the Z right t or
[00:02:19] d one downstroke and you draw a t or d
[00:02:24] go down same with the N you have two
[00:02:28] downstrokes m is three downstrokes if
[00:02:32] you flip the three over you get M four
[00:02:35] ends in r
[00:02:37] five that's an L right five fingers
[00:02:41] gives you an L if I draw a j like that
[00:02:45] kind of looks like a backwards six seven
[00:02:47] if I draw a capital K look at that
[00:02:50] that's two sevens back to back if I draw
[00:02:52] a cursive f it looks like an eight
[00:02:54] finally a nine flip it I get a p and if
[00:02:57] I flip that I get a B
[00:03:00] okay so let's try a number let's choose
[00:03:02] say 54 five is that L right R is the
[00:03:08] four so we have LR now that opens a
[00:03:11] bunch of possibilities where we can
[00:03:13] place the vowels before or in between or
[00:03:16] after whatever we can come up with a
[00:03:18] bunch of words lure lawyer layer layer
[00:03:23] Laura and remember these all go by sound
[00:03:25] so even though a word like lawyer has
[00:03:27] the a w ye e in between the L and the r
[00:03:31] you're thinking okay those aren't really
[00:03:32] vowels although it is a vowel sound the
[00:03:35] sound is all that matters right so
[00:03:37] lawyer the main consonant sounds you
[00:03:39] hear are the L and the R so when you
[00:03:42] hear lawyer or when you see lawyer
[00:03:44] you're going to decipher those two
[00:03:46] consonant sounds into letters
[00:03:48] representing 54 now that number is going
[00:03:51] nowhere in your memory unless you attach
[00:03:53] it to something so depending on what
[00:03:55] you're trying to memorize if it's a
[00:03:57] sequence of numbers we'd have to use
[00:03:59] maybe your body method or you'd use a
[00:04:01] Memory Palace which I've talked about in
[00:04:03] other videos or if you're using
[00:04:04] something like you're trying to remember
[00:04:06] a year or a pin code or a birthday very
[00:04:10] short numbers that have to be attached
[00:04:11] to someone or some fact or something
[00:04:14] that's a different process as well and
[00:04:16] that's probably easier let's start with
[00:04:17] a few examples of how to remember small
[00:04:20] numbers to singular facts let go so the
[00:04:23] first thing I want you to picture is a
[00:04:25] burger hamburger this hamburger has arms
[00:04:28] and he's knocking like you knock on the
[00:04:30] front door on a tick like a tiny little
[00:04:33] tick right so this hamburger is knocking
[00:04:35] on a tick so when I say Burger you think
[00:04:39] knock tick if I say knock tick you can
[00:04:42] tell me it was a burger so it works one
[00:04:44] way or the other the image is complete
[00:04:45] together but one links to the other back
[00:04:48] and forwards the next one is really easy
[00:04:50] what I want you to picture is someone
[00:04:52] really high up just hanging now they're
[00:04:54] hanging by their nose their nose is
[00:04:57] what's holding them up they're hanging
[00:04:58] from their nose and it's a game that's
[00:05:00] the important thing it's hanging by your
[00:05:02] nose it's a game all right the next one
[00:05:04] I want you to picture this is a very
[00:05:06] simple image trading so you're trading
[00:05:09] with someone a dog cage so you have this
[00:05:11] big wiry dog cage maybe there's a dog
[00:05:13] inside maybe it's filthy and what you're
[00:05:16] doing is you're trading that dog cage
[00:05:18] back and forth with someone then you
[00:05:20] give it to them they give it back to you
[00:05:21] all right the next one I want you to
[00:05:22] imagine petting rubbing your hand
[00:05:24] against a door that has fumes coming out
[00:05:27] of it so maybe you're petting this door
[00:05:29] door and on the other side maybe there's
[00:05:31] a fire maybe there's some gas that's
[00:05:33] leaking and there's fumes just emanating
[00:05:35] out of the sides of the cracks of the
[00:05:37] door pet door fume all right so the next
[00:05:41] one I want you to picture a will so you
[00:05:43] have this will with all your last wishes
[00:05:45] and you're on top of a tower and you
[00:05:48] lose it you just drop it will Tower lose
[00:05:51] so quick review we have the burger with
[00:05:53] the knocking on the tick hanging by your
[00:05:56] nose it's a game trading a dog cage
[00:05:59] petting a door with fumes coming out and
[00:06:01] then finally we had a will that you're
[00:06:04] on a tower you lose it now so check this
[00:06:07] out the five things that you memorize
[00:06:09] were some of the tallest buildings in
[00:06:11] the world and their
[00:06:13] heights now here's how it goes the first
[00:06:15] word was a word to help you remember the
[00:06:17] name of the building those other two
[00:06:19] words represented a four-digit number
[00:06:21] which represents the height in feet so
[00:06:24] the first one was a burger it's the
[00:06:27] Burge Khalifa and the height of it
[00:06:29] knocked tick if we break that down into
[00:06:31] its consonant sounds knock which is n
[00:06:35] and a k sound that's two and a seven
[00:06:38] tick which is a one and another seven is
[00:06:41] 2717 the Burge Khalifa is
[00:06:45] 277 ft High wow tallest building in the
[00:06:49] world actually next on our list was hang
[00:06:51] hang Shang the Shanghai Tower which is
[00:06:54] in China Shanghai and you were hanging
[00:06:56] by your nose and it was a game the n and
[00:06:58] the s from knows that's a two and a zero
[00:07:02] and then game was a seven is a cut or a
[00:07:05] hard G so that's a seven and M for game
[00:07:09] is a three so we have
[00:07:11] 273 ft high is the Shanghai Tower next
[00:07:14] we have trading and guesses One World
[00:07:17] Trade Center in New York City this one's
[00:07:19] actually pretty easy to memorize without
[00:07:21] a system the height of it is 1776 a very
[00:07:24] memorable year in American history but
[00:07:26] if you want to use the system to be
[00:07:27] consistent what we had was we we were
[00:07:29] trading the dog cage so dog cage D is a
[00:07:33] one hard G again is a seven cage the cut
[00:07:37] is a seven and the soft G is a six so
[00:07:41] 1776 ft High next we have pet your
[00:07:44] petting something it's the petronus
[00:07:46] towers in quala lumur one of the tallest
[00:07:48] buildings in the world what were we
[00:07:50] petting a door with fume coming out of
[00:07:52] it right so D is a one R is a four
[00:07:56] that's four and then fume is an eight
[00:07:59] and a three so 1483 1,483 ft for the
[00:08:03] petronis towers and finally the Willis
[00:08:06] Tower formerly known as the Sears Tower
[00:08:08] the height of that one remember we were
[00:08:10] at a tower and we lose so Tower is a t
[00:08:13] and an R that's a one and a four and
[00:08:16] then lose five and a zero so we have
[00:08:20] 1,450 ft is the Willis Tower you can do
[00:08:23] anything you want with dates uh maybe
[00:08:26] something happened on a certain date and
[00:08:28] you memorize the for digit year you can
[00:08:30] memorize your PIN code attach it to a
[00:08:32] picture of your bank or whatever
[00:08:33] institution that your PIN number is
[00:08:35] attached to you can do it for a birthday
[00:08:37] and attach it to the person the sky the
[00:08:39] limits my friend thanks for watching
[00:08:41] this video next time we're going to dive
[00:08:43] into how to memorize a really really
[00:08:45] really long list how do you manage your
[00:08:47] memory Palace for a long list but for
[00:08:49] now I'm out stay memorable thanks for
[00:08:52] watching peace

[00:03:19] so oxygen is being constant flow from
[00:03:22] the body and that comes in through the
[00:03:25] reservoir and into the mass but once you
[00:03:27] exhale the valves in the mask close
[00:03:31] so you'll see inside this is ambient air
[00:03:34] this is oxygen intake so when you exhale
[00:03:38] the valves close but the air comes out
[00:03:42] of here but this fills up you'll see me
[00:03:45] do this oh yeah I was like that back on
[00:03:51] my old bottles my management system
[00:03:56] [Music]


=== THE MEMORY PALACE (tutorial + example) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF0obg-Fhes

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:03] hello again welcome my name is Nelson
[00:00:06] and in this video we are going to talk
[00:00:08] about how to memorize a grocery list
[00:00:11] something that we have to do every day
[00:00:13] almost every day at least some type of
[00:00:15] list we have to memorize every day and a
[00:00:17] grocery list is one of those
[00:00:19] items so to memorize a list of things we
[00:00:22] can use different techniques but the
[00:00:24] best one the one that memory Champions
[00:00:26] use in competition to do these crazy
[00:00:28] things is called The Memory Palace but
[00:00:30] first we need to decide what our list
[00:00:35] [Applause]
[00:00:35] [Music]
[00:00:48] is now you could just memorize the list
[00:00:51] by going through all these items in your
[00:00:54] head over and over again but that's
[00:00:57] boring that's the way you did it in
[00:00:59] preschool in kindergarten in first grade
[00:01:01] sixth grade high school and it took you
[00:01:04] hours and you hated it the easy way is
[00:01:06] using this memory pal
[00:01:09] technique taking this list and putting
[00:01:11] it in a familiar place like your
[00:01:13] apartment or your house your workplace
[00:01:15] anything you know really well and that
[00:01:16] you can navigate in your mind's eye so
[00:01:19] what you do is you take yourself back to
[00:01:20] that place and you imagine those pieces
[00:01:24] of your grocery list along a path
[00:01:27] through that place now it's up to you
[00:01:29] what to to do with those images that
[00:01:31] you're going to put in the place the
[00:01:32] more bizarre out of the ordinary crazy
[00:01:35] you make these pictures the more you're
[00:01:37] going to remember them so try to make
[00:01:39] them as silly as possible don't
[00:01:40] understand what I mean quite yet I'm
[00:01:42] going to show you let's dive into my
[00:01:44] mind and actually place these items on
[00:01:47] my grocery list around my apartment
[00:01:50] let's go you ready
[00:01:52] [Music]
[00:02:08] oh
[00:02:13] [Music]
[00:02:42] so as you can see it's pretty easy to
[00:02:45] memorize any list as long as you just
[00:02:47] Place those crazy images of whatever
[00:02:49] you're trying to memorize in a location
[00:02:52] the idea is that when you go back to
[00:02:54] remember what you memorized you're in
[00:02:56] the grocery store you're trying to think
[00:02:58] of that list all you have to do do is
[00:03:00] mentally go back to that same place in
[00:03:02] your head where you stored them and walk
[00:03:04] back through picking up the images that
[00:03:06] you laid on the floor in the sink in the
[00:03:09] bathtub all along that same very same
[00:03:13] path cool right the best thing about it
[00:03:15] you can do that forwards you can do that
[00:03:17] backwards I could tell you what the
[00:03:18] fifth item was sixth item was all I have
[00:03:21] to do is jump to that location in my
[00:03:22] mind and that is the Memory Palace you
[00:03:25] can memorize thousands of digits tons of
[00:03:28] packs of cards all the presidents every
[00:03:31] winner of the NFL Super Bowl whatever
[00:03:34] you want you can use the Memory Palace
[00:03:35] to memorize I have no doubt in my mind
[00:03:38] that your memory will be awesome by the
[00:03:39] time you're done with it I'll see you on
[00:03:40] the flip side as a memory champion

=== Nelson Dellis' MIND SHOW - Boris Konrad // Neuroscientist, Mental Athlete, Speed Stacker ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAmRYC77kRU

[00:00:06] [Music]
[00:00:15] how's everyone going this is another
[00:00:17] episode of the mine show and today's
[00:00:19] guest is good friend of mine a guy who's
[00:00:23] been around with the memory community
[00:00:24] for years from the beginning
[00:00:27] Boris Conrad is from Germany he's a
[00:00:31] researcher in memory neuroscientist and
[00:00:35] also an avid speed stacker which is that
[00:00:38] stacking cup stuff and today we're gonna
[00:00:40] be talking about his research which has
[00:00:43] just gotten a bunch of attention on the
[00:00:45] news we're gonna talk about his memory
[00:00:48] techniques we're gonna talk about his
[00:00:49] speed stacking techniques in history and
[00:00:52] that pretty much wraps it up quick shout
[00:00:55] out if you haven't done this in terms of
[00:00:57] memory research company at work with
[00:00:59] dark neuroscience is doing an extreme
[00:01:01] memory challenge it's very simple I talk
[00:01:04] about it a lot but it's really easy just
[00:01:05] go to the website extreme memory
[00:01:07] challenge calm take this five-minute
[00:01:09] test and you're helping memory research
[00:01:11] they're trying to develop a memory drug
[00:01:13] so please go and do that they're helping
[00:01:16] make this video possible so without
[00:01:18] further ado let's dive into it here is
[00:01:21] Boris Conrad MAME hello everyone welcome
[00:01:25] to another episode of the mind show my
[00:01:28] name is Nelson Dellis I'm the host and
[00:01:30] today we have Boris Conrad a legend in
[00:01:35] the memory sports world welcome to the
[00:01:38] show how you doing
[00:01:39] I'm jk6 my baby yeah thanks for being on
[00:01:42] here where where are you right now and I
[00:01:46] made them where I'm living now for
[00:01:47] nearly 30 years and right now I'm in my
[00:01:50] office at the Dundas Institute for great
[00:01:53] cognition and behavior where I spent my
[00:01:55] time doing research when I'm not on the
[00:01:57] road for either training memory or
[00:01:59] memory yeah I think that's the
[00:02:02] fascinating thing about you is you are
[00:02:04] obviously a high-level competing memory
[00:02:07] athlete but you're also studying the
[00:02:09] brain too right that's what you're in I
[00:02:11] did my PhD in psychology and
[00:02:14] neuroscience in Munich at the Max Planck
[00:02:16] Institute actually studying the brains
[00:02:18] of hungry athletes so in a PhD caesars I
[00:02:21] looked into MIT with memory athletes to
[00:02:26] see what's happening in their brains and
[00:02:27] just recently we had a paper accepted in
[00:02:30] Iran quite established over in the field
[00:02:32] where we publish some of these findings
[00:02:34] and after my PhD I got lucky that I can
[00:02:37] keep doing the research and of course
[00:02:39] that I moved here it isn't as once so
[00:02:41] here the question is why haven't you
[00:02:43] tested me where which outlets are you
[00:02:46] testing we test the athletes that were
[00:02:49] placed in Europe for funding reasons
[00:02:51] expensive enough to fly in people from
[00:02:53] England and Scandinavia to Munich okay
[00:03:01] and so what were the results what would
[00:03:05] have you found or what was the exact
[00:03:07] testing you've been doing we've done
[00:03:09] tons of testings I talk about it for
[00:03:12] hours properly but the main findings are
[00:03:14] compared to the control group of a
[00:03:16] similar age intelligence I know
[00:03:20] background we do find no actual
[00:03:23] differences in brain structure the size
[00:03:25] of the grain but also different brain
[00:03:27] regions are not distinguishable it's
[00:03:30] quite interesting because there are some
[00:03:32] studies looking into groups and the do
[00:03:34] fine group Ruby cyclone or that kind of
[00:03:36] analyzes
[00:03:36] if you go on the pit it gets more
[00:03:38] interesting so when you look for example
[00:03:40] at the connection level all different
[00:03:42] brain regions communicate with each
[00:03:43] other then we do find quite interesting
[00:03:45] kinase interests oh yeah because I think
[00:03:48] the first time I heard about it with
[00:03:50] moonwalking with Einstein they talked
[00:03:51] about the cab
[00:03:52] drivers who learned the knowledge and
[00:03:55] they said that after studying it their
[00:03:56] hippocampus grew right and then I've
[00:03:59] heard other things where if you train
[00:04:00] your brain your hippocampus grows but
[00:04:03] you're saying that maybe that's not
[00:04:04] necessarily the case it seems to be the
[00:04:08] case for some form of training obviously
[00:04:10] the kept growing study is where the
[00:04:11] stablished and complicated wears other
[00:04:14] parts of training it's sometimes a
[00:04:16] little that's clear but there are 70
[00:04:17] forms of training that lead to
[00:04:19] neurogenesis - new neurons clothing
[00:04:22] built-ins a hippocampus but training for
[00:04:25] memory competitions does not seem to be
[00:04:27] a form of achieving that and I don't
[00:04:29] know it's actually quite interesting
[00:04:31] because it means something else
[00:04:33] happening because obviously perform
[00:04:35] people is highly increasing with a train
[00:04:37] and it actually in our opinion just
[00:04:40] shows that it's not a typical
[00:04:43] hippocampus dependent form of learning
[00:04:45] you're just trading over and over but
[00:04:46] instead you're finding maybe a more
[00:04:48] efficient way of memorizing information
[00:04:49] that utilizes lot more different memory
[00:04:53] systems and buys the different parts of
[00:04:54] your brain we actually do find that
[00:04:56] because they do find increased
[00:04:58] connectivity between aspirations and the
[00:05:00] hippocampus so so hippocampus certainly
[00:05:02] has a role but it doesn't get trained
[00:05:04] itself in memory training memory asleep
[00:05:07] interesting I was working with a
[00:05:09] neuroscientist a few years ago he made a
[00:05:12] speech at the u.s. championship anything
[00:05:14] in 2012 and his research he does a lot
[00:05:17] of stuff with Alzheimer's and he would I
[00:05:19] think what he found was at least what he
[00:05:21] says in his speeches about his research
[00:05:25] is that people with larger than average
[00:05:29] hippocampus tend not to get Alzheimer's
[00:05:33] showed some correlation between that but
[00:05:36] and then the next step was saying that
[00:05:38] training your memory or exercising your
[00:05:40] brain increases the size of your
[00:05:42] hippocampus but maybe that's not the
[00:05:43] case so I'll have to figure out another
[00:05:46] way this one has raised it's in the case
[00:05:49] for the numerous leads the way we tested
[00:05:52] them actually the same group that it's a
[00:05:54] kept driver testing already did a study
[00:05:56] under misleads many years back we're on
[00:05:59] a much much lower level and
[00:06:01] much less people but they also did not
[00:06:03] find it so interesting it seems to be
[00:06:06] consistent interesting very cool I would
[00:06:10] love to talk about your very early
[00:06:13] memory days like how did because what
[00:06:16] was your first competition and to those
[00:06:19] myths to read Wow okay so I had been on
[00:06:22] the show last year and I think I think
[00:06:25] he started around the same time right
[00:06:27] and I think he's even little earlier the
[00:06:29] year or two before me but I think there
[00:06:31] are not many veterans that appeal in now
[00:06:34] it might be just you guys so tell me how
[00:06:37] did you get started first of all when
[00:06:39] did you hear about them become memory
[00:06:40] training and what got you interested
[00:06:44] quite funny towards in January 2002
[00:06:47] on German national television there was
[00:06:49] a show called
[00:06:50] John Gibbs show it took some kind of
[00:06:52] translates to the mind show a little bit
[00:06:54] whereas I had a bit like super brain
[00:06:57] which is not on already people show
[00:07:00] casting their different mind sports and
[00:07:03] one of them was dr. kute the Karstens
[00:07:05] accident urban memory champion kind of
[00:07:08] was competitive german memory athletes
[00:07:10] and he was on there he showed that he
[00:07:13] can do something great but more
[00:07:14] importantly he also got to train an
[00:07:16] actress was playing also in real lives
[00:07:20] of the old thump women most people knew
[00:07:23] she wasn't but one aspect of it and the
[00:07:27] intended plot that people saying well if
[00:07:29] she can do it I can do it work well for
[00:07:31] me so I need not worry about it
[00:07:34] it was the year before doing final exams
[00:07:36] in Germany which I did in 2003 for from
[00:07:38] my high school and I was always decent
[00:07:41] in school without spending too much
[00:07:42] effort on it and the promise that there
[00:07:45] is a way to make learning easier and
[00:07:47] maybe get a great for this exam later on
[00:07:50] and university sounded quite appealing
[00:07:52] so I first got the book as many people
[00:07:54] do write a bit about I've used some
[00:07:56] locations for some exams that didn't
[00:07:59] saying too much of it um it helped me a
[00:08:02] bit yeah
[00:08:03] okay okay I've got covered in dust as
[00:08:06] often
[00:08:07] year later they had another episode of
[00:08:09] the show a new episode there was a guy
[00:08:11] on there Monica Linsky who did not
[00:08:14] happen to carry on his language sports
[00:08:16] people nowadays maybe wouldn't recognize
[00:08:19] that name you can find him in the
[00:08:20] rankings he was under exactly my age and
[00:08:23] I asked him how did you start and he
[00:08:24] said I saw the program a year ago I got
[00:08:26] the work because I had to do better to
[00:08:27] find the exams no he was standing there
[00:08:29] memorizing in number 1000 digits and I
[00:08:31] was like what the heck like I also got a
[00:08:33] book in no way possible so what I did
[00:08:37] then ICQ was the face book of the time
[00:08:40] so I went an IC Q and he had a quite
[00:08:42] unique name I found him he told me all
[00:08:44] about memory excel this new amazing Club
[00:08:47] it was just founded in Germany we done
[00:08:49] know the president or for more than ten
[00:08:51] years just had the great website where
[00:08:53] you could practice he mentioned me that
[00:08:56] your book would look like with your
[00:08:58] carsten which are then gods and that
[00:09:00] kind of got me into it so then started
[00:09:02] to really practice it and yeah kind of
[00:09:06] still wars the aim to do well in
[00:09:09] academia to do good at university and it
[00:09:11] certainly helped me a lot was that but
[00:09:13] yeah exam Lorenzen I also discovered
[00:09:15] quiet memory Excel that memory is also
[00:09:17] scored and I wanted to give it a go yeah
[00:09:20] and then so since 2003 what are your
[00:09:24] what are your like stats like if you
[00:09:27] want anything I mean I'm playing dumb
[00:09:30] here tell the audience what you've done
[00:09:31] what records you've had or yes I at the
[00:09:36] beginning started to see that I maybe
[00:09:39] have a tell in compared to also memory
[00:09:40] just needs for mostly words and names
[00:09:42] and faces seems to be a pattern in the
[00:09:44] TRS leads to excel and these two
[00:09:46] disciplines compared to to others so
[00:09:49] quite early on I managed to win German
[00:09:53] person words and not much later two
[00:09:56] three years later I got the world record
[00:09:57] in discipline like seven 100 in 1990 I
[00:10:01] think that was my first world record and
[00:10:03] then I proceeded over the years to
[00:10:04] beating the world records for words and
[00:10:08] names and faces short and long versions
[00:10:10] of that quite a few times with the
[00:10:13] German team who
[00:10:15] I have lucky to be a part of because it
[00:10:17] has even stronger asleep than me I won
[00:10:20] the team title at the World
[00:10:22] Championships I that will either take
[00:10:25] five times panel and I reached the
[00:10:30] finals of the extreme memory tournament
[00:10:32] so Steve when it was succeed at number
[00:10:38] eight or nine I mean that was awesome
[00:10:41] that was such a cool like I felt really
[00:10:43] proud of the competition and obviously
[00:10:45] for you because it was like it just
[00:10:47] showed that not that you're not the best
[00:10:50] but that anyone on any given day can
[00:10:53] like get to the finals if they're like
[00:10:54] having a great day and you were just
[00:10:56] doing really well I was awesome
[00:10:58] maybe too many positive emotions because
[00:11:04] as an ended up messing up the street to
[00:11:06] one lead in the finals I'm so close to
[00:11:08] winning it because I had images against
[00:11:10] honest and worse things than fair
[00:11:11] favorite was that discipline and
[00:11:13] probably also for winning saying I've
[00:11:16] messed that up and gave him that he well
[00:11:19] deserved it sir yeah I think I got
[00:11:22] myself a big share also by being
[00:11:24] passionate about memory and I sing like
[00:11:28] it sometimes summarize that people can
[00:11:30] hear and drink if I did good or not so
[00:11:32] good yeah Morris is known for those who
[00:11:35] don't know for his really loud exciting
[00:11:40] outbursts of positive emotion and also
[00:11:43] negative
[00:11:48] [Applause]
[00:11:52] he's very well-versed in German curse
[00:11:55] words it's the best thing although the
[00:11:59] last xmt you were very like Thoth you
[00:12:02] toned it down a little bit I was
[00:12:03] disappointed I was waiting for these I
[00:12:05] mean like it tends to mean it I never
[00:12:08] played it so people pointed in a play
[00:12:10] tonight just what came out and it's if I
[00:12:12] know I probably want that one because I
[00:12:15] dressed first it feels confident like I
[00:12:18] maybe am less outgoing I actually wanted
[00:12:21] well when I won against Simon's at
[00:12:24] specific year I lost all the egg I made
[00:12:26] the half final that's all it's the best
[00:12:28] I could do because I mean one the year
[00:12:30] before he liked saying all the mattress
[00:12:32] pie with no points against him zero so
[00:12:36] it was like yeah a final that Simon is
[00:12:38] the minute they won't be able to beat
[00:12:41] them and then I want a surprise event
[00:12:43] and didn't expect it let it out in
[00:12:47] secret kind of confused him because any
[00:12:48] rest of the names and yeah I just leave
[00:12:51] like beat them in names that gets it
[00:12:52] here in this format he was a champion in
[00:12:55] names and so it was just a surprise and
[00:12:58] made the up Kirsten the same saying if I
[00:13:00] have it all set in I confident I got it
[00:13:02] correct it's all good and then I'm
[00:13:04] making mistakes and yeah I'm gonna try
[00:13:11] and put a few the clips here so people
[00:13:14] can see it if you don't mind
[00:13:17] so another thing you're very passionate
[00:13:20] about and also championing as the speed
[00:13:22] staffing right it's true so they're
[00:13:26] stacking cups my line I don't have any
[00:13:31] in my office I want to show you what can
[00:13:33] also put a clip if you like it's a big
[00:13:36] thing in the US but also in nature
[00:13:38] it's totally much more people in memory
[00:13:41] Sports has and I'm only a check in my HD
[00:13:44] visions there so it's actually saying
[00:13:46] we're kids mostly teenagers still beat
[00:13:49] us a long way so because they have
[00:13:51] smaller hands or what lighter lighter
[00:13:54] arms you think doesn't keep it
[00:13:57] yes yeah no I think it's basically when
[00:14:03] you start doing it because we now have a
[00:14:05] lot of not kids anymore young adults in
[00:14:08] the collegiate division it Sport
[00:14:10] Stacking we have many more HD visuals
[00:14:11] and in memory collegiate means 19 to 24
[00:14:14] years of age and there's no good number
[00:14:16] of mostly American and German students
[00:14:19] we were started when they were just 12
[00:14:21] or 13 and they still get better than
[00:14:23] they ever were and like totally crash
[00:14:25] any record I previously had seven that
[00:14:27] HD vision many respect because if you
[00:14:31] are young your brain is no plastic you
[00:14:33] learn movements which are not typically
[00:14:36] part of your life much faster and get
[00:14:38] much more proficient at that and I think
[00:14:40] that's most likely explanation I started
[00:14:43] as and all of the start it's the sports
[00:14:45] taking when I was just 18 or 19 and
[00:14:48] these people started when they were 8 or
[00:14:50] 9 or PT 1213 and then they just learned
[00:14:52] it much faster so I guess if the sport
[00:14:55] keeps keeps doing well it looks like it
[00:14:57] it's quite popular it's not decreasing
[00:15:00] on popularity in in quite a few years
[00:15:02] the records will actually be in the
[00:15:04] young adults age division yes do see in
[00:15:07] a lot of the Olympic sports in this
[00:15:09] stuff where it's really being fast in
[00:15:12] the moment that's often where people say
[00:15:14] early 20's to passed and I'm saying we
[00:15:16] will have same thing Sport Stacking when
[00:15:18] there are enough people there we started
[00:15:21] as kids it just kept going yeah it's so
[00:15:25] excuse my ignorance or sorry if this
[00:15:27] sounds bad but for the audience
[00:15:29] listening I'm sure that to most people
[00:15:32] stacking cups does not evoke the thought
[00:15:35] of sport right but it's such an obscure
[00:15:39] thing like why cups why stacking them
[00:15:43] you know how did this sport come around
[00:15:46] I mean obviously someone was stacking
[00:15:48] cups I was like hey how fast can I do
[00:15:50] this but how did it I mean it's a
[00:15:51] phenomenon I mean there's people there's
[00:15:53] like it's as popular as Rubik's Cube
[00:15:56] competitions right I mean essentially
[00:15:57] maybe even less but yeah it's it's
[00:16:01] probably more more popular than memory
[00:16:04] sports right hey
[00:16:08] so how did that do you know the history
[00:16:10] of the sport
[00:16:11] yeah I think I do know it quite well
[00:16:13] surprise the memory athlete asked me the
[00:16:16] question is what's the co Explorer I
[00:16:19] mean like people say it's worth taking
[00:16:24] at least there's some yeah chess is it's
[00:16:30] part of the Olympic Committee
[00:16:31] internationally and there's interest is
[00:16:34] even less than in every sports so
[00:16:36] movement is maybe not necessarily
[00:16:40] determining if something is his court or
[00:16:42] not Sport Stacking came from first it
[00:16:46] came from Florida
[00:16:47] so you're region from someone was
[00:16:50] teaching but also active in the juice
[00:16:52] circus and it was just like a juggling
[00:16:55] variation like it was picked up by Bob
[00:16:59] Fox who is well known in that squirt who
[00:17:02] is a teacher who was a teacher in Denver
[00:17:05] Colorado and he found it amazing and so
[00:17:09] it's a great thing to get his kids
[00:17:10] engage in in the squirt that's new and
[00:17:14] also also not so related to other sports
[00:17:17] so you're telling that he maybe got all
[00:17:20] your life didn't make too much
[00:17:22] difference there so it's a sport you can
[00:17:25] do indoors when maybe it's gymnasium
[00:17:27] isn't possible to use and it's also
[00:17:29] something you can quickly do at the
[00:17:30] beginning of class and he just liked it
[00:17:33] as a teacher and he liked it so much
[00:17:35] that he then went on making it the
[00:17:37] business speed stacks and quitting his
[00:17:40] teaching career and going to all the
[00:17:42] teacher conventions in the US for many
[00:17:44] years often versus own kids and because
[00:17:47] of that mostly Emily Fox that's all the
[00:17:49] story got quite famous because a YouTube
[00:17:51] video as I don't know how many more
[00:17:53] years of clicks and then yeah YouTube he
[00:17:55] did that all through the late 90s so
[00:17:58] Emily of course is about our age most
[00:18:00] kids who do sports taking Corey Stoll
[00:18:02] saying she is so 18 because the video in
[00:18:05] 1997 or something is what made her
[00:18:06] famous and so he educated it to teachers
[00:18:12] and then YouTube or video in the
[00:18:14] internet and general made a travel
[00:18:16] across the globe
[00:18:17] made it
[00:18:18] Peter and then I think that's what's the
[00:18:22] driving factor that kids and like we're
[00:18:24] not just telling their mates in that
[00:18:26] class where maybe then three were really
[00:18:28] passionate and they had like that but
[00:18:30] just like with any sport and there were
[00:18:32] no groups and suddenly these groups are
[00:18:34] kind of forming gradually over the
[00:18:35] internet and now they were like many of
[00:18:38] these kids who are really good at it
[00:18:40] they do it each day two three hours
[00:18:41] and then connected with 30 other status
[00:18:44] in the world we're like we do know we do
[00:18:46] over the Internet yeah it's a great time
[00:18:48] you will just scream louder than I do
[00:18:50] it's a really big thing it's course
[00:18:52] second-degree money to the good times so
[00:18:53] it's perfectly okay and we'll show their
[00:18:55] timer to the camera and they'll just
[00:18:57] keep pushing themselves and nowadays you
[00:18:59] have sports taking associations in like
[00:19:03] 30 different countries you have in
[00:19:05] Germany lots of different clubs we have
[00:19:08] the World Championships which
[00:19:10] traditionally were in the US but no for
[00:19:13] quite a few years of traveling we had
[00:19:15] some in Germany twice I was to Canada
[00:19:17] for it
[00:19:17] this April of we'll go to Taiwan via
[00:19:20] nature this year and I attract like
[00:19:22] hundreds of people and yeah as you said
[00:19:25] it's a bit comparable comparable to
[00:19:27] maybe speedcubing that it's mostly kids
[00:19:29] who get into it and they mostly get into
[00:19:32] it not by being encouraged by seniors to
[00:19:35] do it because they don't existence or
[00:19:37] yet yeah busy
[00:19:38] Nathan's eye appears to also have to do
[00:19:39] it interesting and so talk to me a bit
[00:19:43] about what goes into stacking cups and
[00:19:45] how to become a champion right because
[00:19:47] my head for my I don't know much about
[00:19:49] it but for memory Sports you know you
[00:19:51] start out you improve your memory but
[00:19:54] maybe you develop your systems to more
[00:19:55] complex ones is there an equivalent to
[00:19:58] speed setting like if you were gonna
[00:19:59] train me to become a champion obviously
[00:20:02] you probably have to teach me the basic
[00:20:03] moves but then if I wanted to get to the
[00:20:05] next level
[00:20:06] Arthur like other training strategies or
[00:20:10] I mean what how do you what what is it
[00:20:12] like and so you know stated repetition
[00:20:16] to just get fast it's muscle memory
[00:20:18] right it's like the pension is always
[00:20:20] the same revenue do we always have
[00:20:21] different patterns no the payments are
[00:20:23] set we always see the same matters and
[00:20:25] kind of try to optimize them then you
[00:20:27] have like different
[00:20:29] ways of doing it based mostly practicing
[00:20:32] its most important but you do seem kind
[00:20:34] of these kids we're expert in they're
[00:20:36] talking about different styles and then
[00:20:38] there's a style named after some of the
[00:20:40] most famous stickers or really good and
[00:20:43] some maybe old cab with a pinky a little
[00:20:45] different or with another cup down first
[00:20:48] so moves pedaling around and nowadays
[00:20:51] many kids do what traditionally was
[00:20:53] left-handed style where you like start
[00:20:55] with the opposite side then you have the
[00:20:57] first cup up maybe a tenth of a tenth of
[00:21:00] a second faster and so they're like
[00:21:03] optimizing the strategy in that way I do
[00:21:05] saying if you just keep growing as also
[00:21:08] some do and I did keeping your style
[00:21:10] those working on a faster another
[00:21:13] component coming into it which sports
[00:21:15] taking also maybe in general in the
[00:21:16] words of Germans as that famous for is
[00:21:18] in a competition
[00:21:19] you only have three attempts so in
[00:21:22] particular in the US which they had many
[00:21:24] years that they had the stars on youtube
[00:21:27] like fastest kids on YouTube we had like
[00:21:29] the best time well you've seen ever like
[00:21:31] they can do the whole patter and if it's
[00:21:33] really well in five points 0 seconds
[00:21:35] nowadays even faster but they didn't win
[00:21:37] the competition the German weren't the
[00:21:39] competition because we only have three
[00:21:41] attempts and then like gross three times
[00:21:42] really fast and because they all the
[00:21:45] ever practices go fast but like one out
[00:21:47] of ten times they make it and then
[00:21:49] they're super happy but nine out of ten
[00:21:51] times everything falls down and so if we
[00:21:53] come Falls zero lose right you know I do
[00:21:57] this time you can you can fix you humble
[00:21:59] it fix your thumb what's corrected yeah
[00:22:01] but obviously you want to get the best
[00:22:03] time anymore if you need to like you're
[00:22:04] a backup from the impact of the table so
[00:22:07] yeah as I said the longest discipline
[00:22:11] takes like five seconds the short runs
[00:22:12] one point five to two or in the middle
[00:22:15] one to two three seconds it's a long one
[00:22:18] like five to eight seconds depending of
[00:22:20] the age division so there if you have to
[00:22:23] grab a cup a second it's gone you can't
[00:22:24] can't forget about it
[00:22:27] Germany we had a national coach all the
[00:22:29] time who really made the kids and as
[00:22:31] practice to also have a safe time which
[00:22:34] was maybe like 10 20 percent slower than
[00:22:36] the fastest time but you get it in two
[00:22:38] other three attempts you trying to go
[00:22:40] for it and then you do that in the first
[00:22:42] have already a good time standing and
[00:22:44] then you have two times to shoot for
[00:22:45] your best and it works or not that often
[00:22:49] that save time wasn't good enough
[00:22:50] because in Serie trainings they were
[00:22:53] fast as he as a kid's Rapids they just
[00:22:54] do it in a competition so suddenly there
[00:22:57] is focused components mental component
[00:22:59] in it quite strongly which also appealed
[00:23:01] to me as a memory asleep and I just
[00:23:03] thought to have much more passion for
[00:23:05] memory sports at for Sport Stacking I
[00:23:06] did get into it because I saw it on TV
[00:23:09] also and it was reported that their
[00:23:11] studies and who they are out there I
[00:23:13] checked them or at old papers that
[00:23:15] confer benefits of Sport Stacking also
[00:23:17] for cognitive skills I think it's a
[00:23:20] little bit exaggerated in some most
[00:23:22] promotional material but basic idea is
[00:23:24] totally true that it's good for
[00:23:25] concentration but also even cognitive
[00:23:27] tests as is also if you like to jog
[00:23:29] that's sorry
[00:23:31] they are core dimension yeah come on
[00:23:32] then it's also true for Sport Stacking
[00:23:34] and it's how I read about it I don't
[00:23:37] sing it make my memory better but the
[00:23:39] sports competitions I guess helped me
[00:23:41] also to get better times and memory
[00:23:43] competitions so we focus - right exactly
[00:23:46] in early years I would happen quite
[00:23:48] often in speed cars that's a first years
[00:23:50] people were not really a threat of me
[00:23:51] leading them before speed cards because
[00:23:54] they caught bad apple fails because of
[00:23:56] that and I think now in the last I don't
[00:23:58] know what is it five years I have 90% or
[00:24:02] almost because attempts in competitions
[00:24:03] are these one hasta - because this kind
[00:24:08] of training also helped me to to get
[00:24:10] then the save time done in the
[00:24:12] competition - okay
[00:24:14] if it goes really well I can do attack
[00:24:15] in 26 seconds but if I can't get it in
[00:24:18] 60 seconds in the competition it's not
[00:24:20] actually that much works it's not so
[00:24:22] valuable I can do that
[00:24:24] right so no I'm quite constant and
[00:24:26] having one or two attempts in 30 32
[00:24:29] seconds and it's often good enough to at
[00:24:31] least secure the top position in the
[00:24:33] field and if I get it on the first
[00:24:35] attempt I can still try 22nd or yeah I
[00:24:38] mean nowadays 20 seconds 26 seconds like
[00:24:40] it was records a few years back then in
[00:24:47] the second attempt if I had a good save
[00:24:49] first ones that would seek your monetary
[00:24:51] position or whatever it was going for
[00:24:53] yeah
[00:24:54] and so let's switch the memory again so
[00:24:57] what do you what do you currently use
[00:24:59] for your systems for cards and numbers
[00:25:02] for cards I'd use a two part system
[00:25:04] which is basically the band system and a
[00:25:07] German adaptation I made myself no share
[00:25:10] it also with 70 other memory athletes in
[00:25:12] Germany and you put two cards
[00:25:16] sorry go ahead yeah I think you talked
[00:25:18] about it was penny four so two cards get
[00:25:21] into one image by two symbols giving the
[00:25:26] first tenant the first parts value gives
[00:25:30] the bit whoa cool and sir
[00:25:31] you soon as consonant and then you just
[00:25:34] make words out of it and so each
[00:25:37] combination of two playing cards 2007
[00:25:39] and for Sam has specific eight which I
[00:25:42] practice over time and it got me to be
[00:25:45] getting to a level that was as fast as I
[00:25:47] was with this card system I used before
[00:25:50] didn't even have a PPO or anything fancy
[00:25:53] I really had for the first ten years of
[00:25:55] memory sports I have one card in the
[00:25:56] morning it's always the same and the guy
[00:25:59] copied it from she definitely told me
[00:26:01] you will never be able to do a new 45
[00:26:02] seconds I got 225 seconds with it so
[00:26:05] still wondering our whole time I put
[00:26:07] into the other system maybe I could do
[00:26:08] it it when I have no idea but but that
[00:26:11] was what I changed it from and yeah your
[00:26:14] question I put two images on one
[00:26:16] location
[00:26:16] kind of in memory competitions do that
[00:26:19] in nearly all disciplines and then for
[00:26:22] the numbers what do you have there's a
[00:26:24] subset of that so it's a thousand lives
[00:26:27] it's member system being a subset from
[00:26:30] the cart system so it's a constant
[00:26:32] multiple continents as part of the
[00:26:36] bigger system nice and what are your top
[00:26:38] scores for cards in practice in practice
[00:26:42] I think on memory leak it's 24 seconds
[00:26:47] and with real cards 26 okay Wow and then
[00:26:50] with numbers and five minutes in five
[00:26:53] minutes in tractus 363 ad and it's in
[00:26:59] your chemistry idea tried 400 a few
[00:27:02] times and so far it didn't get it that's
[00:27:05] saying around there mmm it's one of the
[00:27:07] disciplines where still struggle and
[00:27:09] competition sometimes to get I was 300 a
[00:27:12] gap in here and in there and constant a
[00:27:15] couple of points was the traditional way
[00:27:16] memory sport works culture I have a
[00:27:18] personal best in every league of 17
[00:27:20] seconds so it 480 digits right sorry for
[00:27:25] the 80 digits and 1 minute 18 inches in
[00:27:27] one game
[00:27:28] Wow okay I have also Guinness Book World
[00:27:32] Record so the dependent Chinese show
[00:27:35] where 15 three-digit numbers flashed
[00:27:38] like once per second yeah so I also got
[00:27:41] that down to in training the best world
[00:27:44] at like 30 or 40 in a row so it would be
[00:27:46] like a hundred 20 digits flashing at
[00:27:49] once read it an image per seconds 40
[00:27:52] times after each other my best numbers
[00:27:55] are quite good but there are still lacks
[00:27:57] the consistency so I like the Ben cart
[00:28:00] system because it's always gives me the
[00:28:02] chance to puzzle it together it's when I
[00:28:04] go under 30 seconds I super rarely can
[00:28:07] just click all the cuts room
[00:28:08] I usually attend to have three locations
[00:28:11] may be missing so that's quite a lot was
[00:28:13] the system so it would be 12 cards your
[00:28:15] turn I can't like to look all the
[00:28:17] impress through the image turns and
[00:28:19] every year yeah I gather that's a fish
[00:28:21] and oh yeah it was here and I love that
[00:28:24] it feels so great to then find it and
[00:28:26] with the current number system it just
[00:28:28] doesn't work because I would need to go
[00:28:30] through a thousand images and the whole
[00:28:32] time or four minutes of course that's
[00:28:33] not allows that so yeah I need to find a
[00:28:37] way to get these images to stick better
[00:28:40] that that I can do numbers himself
[00:28:43] repetition of course and I know didn't
[00:28:45] score like 32 seconds it's like a
[00:28:47] standard score for me and memory likud
[00:28:48] this online competition score matches we
[00:28:50] know had I did review it once so I often
[00:28:54] lose against people that maybe by 28
[00:28:56] seconds and I snooze it was algebra
[00:28:58] vision if I go for 28 seconds was
[00:29:00] aggravation it's the fields for me that
[00:29:03] I have the same number of gaps as if I
[00:29:05] went in 18 seconds rather don't it's the
[00:29:08] revision well I could fix it more absurd
[00:29:09] you need to work on Nancy to get better
[00:29:11] girl got and what's what's gonna wrap up
[00:29:15] now but I'd like
[00:29:16] know what you're up to what's next are
[00:29:19] you trying to compete somewhere are you
[00:29:21] working on another system what's what's
[00:29:23] the big next thing for you in Christ
[00:29:26] happy to welcome you to Germany and
[00:29:27] people run the memory leak you meant to
[00:29:29] get out in Germany as in there yeah
[00:29:31] and of may that will be great so I
[00:29:33] mentioned I'm already for more than ten
[00:29:35] years the president of memory Excel and
[00:29:37] I'm super excited about our memory
[00:29:39] Sports is changing now it's a bit of
[00:29:41] like uncertain times and that can be
[00:29:44] frightening and it's annoying how some
[00:29:47] politics are important sometimes but I'm
[00:29:51] happy that we have our team here in
[00:29:53] Europe and we will run again the South
[00:29:56] German championships North German
[00:29:58] championships including an open
[00:29:59] competition and the traditional formats
[00:30:02] and that will ease ahead in charge for
[00:30:04] both of them as a real gentlemen really
[00:30:06] events so for the next months in memory
[00:30:09] sports I focus on that I'm already
[00:30:11] looking forward to competing in memory
[00:30:14] big event again so happy to see already
[00:30:17] on the horizon
[00:30:19] in a year that there is an international
[00:30:21] not really event again maybe by not
[00:30:25] being at too many other memory
[00:30:26] competitions before people don't think
[00:30:28] too much of me when they say go whom to
[00:30:31] look out for so I can maybe it's quite
[00:30:33] nicely just in this online competition
[00:30:35] we're playing I'm really online I reach
[00:30:37] the finals again so yeah obviously kind
[00:30:39] of confidence and in this format it's
[00:30:41] kind of shooting well my strengths in
[00:30:44] many sports still have chances in
[00:30:48] leading basically anyone who's out there
[00:30:51] then that's what I like in this format
[00:30:53] it's much less clear who's going to win
[00:30:54] and this traditionally tenders little
[00:30:57] events I mean like Alex and Marvin
[00:30:59] changed it quite a bit so after a few
[00:31:01] years so it's always been the same three
[00:31:03] four people suddenly very two more names
[00:31:05] in the mix but it's still maybe know
[00:31:07] four or five people who might win such
[00:31:09] an event if they are all there where the
[00:31:11] memory leak it's close to everyone
[00:31:13] competing actually has a chance to win
[00:31:14] it and I think that should be the future
[00:31:16] will be the future for eSports and
[00:31:18] looking forward to Casting that in
[00:31:21] Europe very good thanks again for being
[00:31:24] on the show I'm going to show some of
[00:31:27] your clips through this talk just
[00:31:29] because they're there
[00:31:30] fun to watch but thanks again I'll see
[00:31:32] you in in Germany soon very soon it's
[00:31:36] awesome yeah thanks for hitting begins
[00:31:38] if there's anyone who has questions
[00:31:40] about science we do try a research on
[00:31:43] memory athletes test feel free to reach
[00:31:45] out to me I'll put your in your
[00:31:47] information below this project this
[00:31:49] paper I just mentioned is at this moment
[00:31:51] accepted but not published yet say I
[00:31:54] need to do all the formatting I guess
[00:31:56] that's the world know when it when it is
[00:31:58] out so anyone really interested in
[00:32:01] research behind superior memory in any
[00:32:03] form that just studying memory asleep
[00:32:05] would be super excited if anyone is
[00:32:07] watching who believes to be part of see
[00:32:09] so-called highly superior
[00:32:11] autobiographical memory people yeah the
[00:32:14] super good ought to be a graphical
[00:32:16] memory but maybe can't memorize deck of
[00:32:17] cards I would have to hear from such
[00:32:19] people because like all the forms of
[00:32:22] superior memory is what interests me
[00:32:23] science wise research wise and they also
[00:32:26] yeah as a plan to keep working in that
[00:32:28] field so I would love to hear from
[00:32:30] people who might Evan former super
[00:32:34] memory that's not related to memory
[00:32:36] sports just reach out to me I would be
[00:32:37] really grateful for that
[00:32:39] also yeah I'll put your contact info
[00:32:41] below in case you're one of these people
[00:32:42] reach out them for sure thanks again for
[00:32:46] us you're the man you're a good guy I
[00:32:49] can't wait to compete against you and
[00:32:50] run a competition with you so I'll see
[00:32:52] you then thanks for being on my show man
[00:32:54] take care thank you guys see ya

=== THE BODY METHOD // RANDOM MEMORY TIPS #001 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo-iIkDtD5A

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:09] hello how you doing my name is Nelson
[00:00:12] Dellis what I'm going to do is show you
[00:00:14] how to memorize something you can use
[00:00:15] right now let's go alright so what we're
[00:00:23] going to learn today I'm going to make
[00:00:24] you memorize ten seemingly pretty random
[00:00:28] things cool cool the first thing we're
[00:00:31] going to do is we're going to choose ten
[00:00:33] body parts we're going to start at the
[00:00:34] top of our head that's going to be the
[00:00:36] first one then we're going to come down
[00:00:37] to our ears that's to our eyes this area
[00:00:40] three the nose for the mouth five the
[00:00:44] chin six the armpit seven belly button
[00:00:49] chest area eight the knees nine and then
[00:00:52] down the floor on my feet will be ten
[00:00:54] very simple so first things first we're
[00:00:58] at the top of our head I want you to
[00:00:59] picture some chopsticks there's some
[00:01:03] chopsticks on the top of my head kind of
[00:01:06] picking out some sushi whatever there's
[00:01:08] two wooden sticks stuck in my hair okay
[00:01:10] next we're down to the ears
[00:01:12] alright delicious Indian curry dish okay
[00:01:16] now really imagine you can taste it it's
[00:01:18] overflowing coming out of my ears okay
[00:01:21] the actual sauce is hot and smells
[00:01:24] delicious you want to eat it coming out
[00:01:26] of my ears okay next we got a hamburger
[00:01:29] that's going to go on the eyes
[00:01:31] imagine a burger is coming out of your
[00:01:33] eyes or that there's a burger blocking
[00:01:35] your eye
[00:01:36] the juices from the beef coming out of
[00:01:38] your eye dripping down your cheek like
[00:01:40] tear of beef soft alright next breath
[00:01:45] the nose we have this person putting a
[00:01:48] palm into the dough so I want you to
[00:01:51] remember in go into the dough in dough
[00:01:56] okay and so imagine that's happening on
[00:01:59] my nose so you're going to imagine
[00:02:00] someone pressing dough into my nose
[00:02:04] [Music]
[00:02:11] by the next one okay all the mouth we're
[00:02:14] going to picture a bra I want you to
[00:02:17] imagine a bra it's just coming out of my
[00:02:20] mouth I've got it deep down on my throat
[00:02:22] I'm just like pulling out and there it
[00:02:24] is broth coming out of my mouth we move
[00:02:28] down to the chin I want you to picture a
[00:02:30] pack of cards just resting on my chin
[00:02:33] and there's a dealer who wants to just
[00:02:36] deal these cards these individual cards
[00:02:38] from the pack off of my chin right that
[00:02:41] goes right there so we've done the whole
[00:02:42] face the next thing I want you to
[00:02:44] picture is that I lift my arm pit and
[00:02:46] blurting out of my armpit are a bunch of
[00:02:49] cheerio type cereal boom next we're down
[00:02:56] at the belly button right I want you to
[00:02:58] imagine that out of my belly button is a
[00:03:00] gun just firing all sorts of blintz and
[00:03:04] growth belly button stuff out at you
[00:03:06] right and what sound does it make bang
[00:03:08] right bang imagine that right here bang
[00:03:13] so down here on the knees alright let's
[00:03:16] just imagine that we have a bunch of
[00:03:18] martini and vodka on the knees so this
[00:03:24] means the vodka and I pour it into this
[00:03:25] glass here somehow I like that and now
[00:03:28] down to the feet I boots on why not
[00:03:30] because that's memorable down on the
[00:03:32] floor is a pan it's cooking something
[00:03:37] off of the floor and it smells delicious
[00:03:40] you just imagine the pan on the floor
[00:03:43] you got all that I hope so and I want
[00:03:46] you to take a few minutes just to see if
[00:03:48] you can remember starting in my head
[00:03:50] down to my key what the ten things were
[00:03:53] I'm going to go do something while you
[00:03:55] do that I'll be right back
[00:03:58] [Music]
[00:04:02] all right that should have given you
[00:04:05] enough time to review everything let's
[00:04:06] go over them one more time to see if you
[00:04:08] got them first thing was the chopsticks
[00:04:10] on my head out of my ear was the chicken
[00:04:14] curry Indian dish on my I was a
[00:04:18] hamburger out of my nose was some dough
[00:04:21] that I was pushing in out of my mouth
[00:04:24] was a very long and sexy bra right out
[00:04:28] of my chin there was a dealer dealing
[00:04:31] out cards from pack of cards right then
[00:04:34] we go to my armpit
[00:04:35] what was coming out of it Cheerios out
[00:04:39] of my bellybutton bang like a gun on my
[00:04:42] knees martini glass with vodka in it and
[00:04:46] then finally on the floor the pan
[00:04:48] cooking stuff by my funky boot now what
[00:04:53] on earth does any of that mean what I
[00:04:56] had you memorize are the 10 most
[00:04:58] populated country in the world here's
[00:05:01] how what was on my head chopsticks China
[00:05:05] curry dish India hamburger America dough
[00:05:10] that you're pressing in in dough Lygia
[00:05:13] the bra brasil pack of cards pakistan's
[00:05:18] curios nigeria nigeria bang glad Esch
[00:05:24] where else you get bodka but in russia
[00:05:26] and finally hand japan so without
[00:05:31] looking at those pictures you can say 10
[00:05:33] most populated countries in the world
[00:05:35] China India USA Indonesia Brazil
[00:05:42] Pakistan Nigeria Nigeria Bangladesh

=== Nelson Dellis' MIND SHOW - Javen Ho // Mental Abacus ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gon7O00G5oo

[00:00:06] [Music]
[00:00:15] hello it's Nelson DS here another
[00:00:17] episode of the Mind show and today we
[00:00:19] are going to be talking with a
[00:00:21] 16-year-old kid Math Prodigy named Javin
[00:00:25] hoe um he's a very interesting guy I met
[00:00:28] him um on a show that I filmed last
[00:00:31] summer which I hope will Air this summer
[00:00:35] um I have a really cool segment on it he
[00:00:37] has a really cool segment on it and um
[00:00:40] we're going to talk about that and his
[00:00:42] skill which um I guess some of us have
[00:00:46] General skills in terms of memory or
[00:00:48] mental calculation and then further
[00:00:50] specification so his further
[00:00:52] specification of mental calculation is
[00:00:55] he can add really really fast and do
[00:00:58] multiplication really really fast so
[00:01:00] um on this show which you hopefully will
[00:01:02] see I can't mention it just yet um he um
[00:01:06] shows off the skill to an awesome degree
[00:01:08] it's really cool to watch and kind of
[00:01:10] unbelievable anyways he's new to this
[00:01:13] stuff he's a a you know young kid in
[00:01:15] school so um I just prob him for some
[00:01:18] questions here and his answers are
[00:01:20] pretty interesting so have a listen and
[00:01:22] before we dive in I just want to give a
[00:01:24] shout out to our main sponsor which is
[00:01:27] the extreme memory challenge um which
[00:01:29] which is a research project done by Dart
[00:01:32] NeuroScience around San Diego um doing
[00:01:35] some really cutting edge um memory
[00:01:38] research trying to find um a pill to
[00:01:42] help memory so cognitive disabling
[00:01:44] diseases uh memory impairment trying to
[00:01:46] improve memory uh as many of you know
[00:01:49] Alzheimer's is something that took my
[00:01:51] grandmother and I've kind of devoted my
[00:01:54] my mission to figuring out um how to
[00:01:57] raise awareness for the disease and
[00:01:59] finding interesting opportunities for uh
[00:02:01] research in that field as well hence why
[00:02:04] I joined a partnership with d
[00:02:07] Neuroscience anyways the test U uh for
[00:02:10] the extreme memory challenge is fairly
[00:02:13] straightforward uh it's very short it's
[00:02:15] free I know that it sounds like I'm
[00:02:17] asking you for something in return but
[00:02:20] the only thing I want you to do is to
[00:02:21] take the test so please go take the test
[00:02:23] it it's a memory test so see how good
[00:02:25] your memory is compared to mine you'll
[00:02:27] see the results and at the same time
[00:02:29] you're helping out research uh for
[00:02:31] something that I'm really passionate
[00:02:32] about and care a lot about so please go
[00:02:34] to their website which is extremem
[00:02:36] memory
[00:02:37] challenge.com
[00:02:38] and uh the rest is pretty self-
[00:02:41] inspiratory thank you so much hello and
[00:02:44] welcome to another episode of the Mind
[00:02:46] show with Nelson delis me your host and
[00:02:50] today's guest we have U the young how
[00:02:53] old are you I'm 16 16-year-old Javin ho
[00:02:58] um did I pronounce that correctly
[00:03:00] yep um who is a mental calculator um and
[00:03:05] where are you based out of your West
[00:03:07] Coast um uh yeah Arizona okay nice and
[00:03:12] so I met Javin on the set of a show
[00:03:14] that's hopefully going to air this
[00:03:16] summer um about brain Feats um I did
[00:03:19] something with memory obviously and he
[00:03:20] did something with mental calculation
[00:03:23] and uh it's pretty impressive so um why
[00:03:28] don't you tell us what you can
[00:03:30] do um well at my level right now I am
[00:03:34] able to multiply digits up to 3 by three
[00:03:38] two digits um I can divide up to four
[00:03:43] digits divide by three digits and I can
[00:03:46] add really big numbers really fast right
[00:03:49] yeah really fast really fast yeah that's
[00:03:51] amazing and so it's I mean I know the
[00:03:53] answers to these questions but I'm I'm
[00:03:55] pretending to be uh aloof for the
[00:03:58] audience listening but um are you
[00:04:00] naturally born with this or is this
[00:04:02] something you've practiced um no so I
[00:04:05] started going to this kind of like kind
[00:04:08] of Private School in my area my my mom
[00:04:11] put me into it I started when I was five
[00:04:13] okay um this was before I actually knew
[00:04:16] what numbers were so as I learned I I
[00:04:19] started thinking of numbers the first
[00:04:20] thing I thought about them were on the
[00:04:21] advocus so I I basically learned advocus
[00:04:23] at this at this foundation and I started
[00:04:25] 5 and I went all the way until was about
[00:04:27] 12 and 13 that's when I stopped so
[00:04:30] learning the fundamentals of numbers and
[00:04:33] basic addition subtraction all these
[00:04:35] things with the use of an abacus right
[00:04:37] yeah or the soran right that they call
[00:04:39] it in Japan the soran yeah and um that's
[00:04:43] incredible so this what what's the name
[00:04:45] of this uh school or Foundation um it's
[00:04:48] called IQ Abacus IQ Abacus yeah it
[00:04:51] started as this one just like this small
[00:04:54] place but it's kind of grown into
[00:04:55] different states and uh counties now got
[00:04:58] it and I mean are there other kids that
[00:05:01] you were starting out with when you were
[00:05:03] five that are just like you or are you
[00:05:06] maybe the only one that went through the
[00:05:09] whole training I don't know um so I I
[00:05:13] when back when I was little about when I
[00:05:15] was about n or 10 there were still like
[00:05:17] the veterans at the school that were
[00:05:19] pretty good they were better than me um
[00:05:21] okay but they kind of laid off and they
[00:05:22] kind of quit as they kind of went into
[00:05:24] like more word problem based Math
[00:05:25] instead of mental calculations and I
[00:05:27] kind of just stuck on with the mental
[00:05:28] calculations got it okay that's
[00:05:30] fascinating I mean it's interesting to
[00:05:32] think like when you you know first learn
[00:05:35] about numbers how that's taught to you
[00:05:37] is basically setting how you think about
[00:05:40] numbers for the rest of your life you
[00:05:42] know and if someone teaches that to you
[00:05:44] poorly then you might struggle with
[00:05:47] numbers in the future but with Abacus I
[00:05:49] mean I've always wanted to learn how to
[00:05:52] do the mental calculation thing and
[00:05:54] learn the Abacus and I I I gave it a
[00:05:56] good go this summer um I I I really
[00:05:59] tried to to learn um and get really good
[00:06:01] at the movements on the Abacus and it's
[00:06:03] it's hard because you're so used to
[00:06:06] wanting to do these simple you know
[00:06:09] additions in your head but you got to
[00:06:10] like do it on the Abacus first and then
[00:06:13] I got pretty good at that touching an
[00:06:15] abacus but the hard part for me and I
[00:06:17] guess at some point once you learn in
[00:06:19] the school how to use the appus how it
[00:06:21] works how to do basic um arithmetic you
[00:06:25] then you then move it away and you do it
[00:06:27] in your head right you have a mental
[00:06:29] advocate right right yeah yeah um so
[00:06:32] you're visualizing this Abacus and just
[00:06:34] playing with the beats in your mind
[00:06:36] which sounds so uh insane but uh that's
[00:06:39] what you do right yeah um it's got to
[00:06:43] the point for me where when I see
[00:06:44] numbers and I try to add them it's just
[00:06:46] instantaneous it's basically like muscle
[00:06:48] memory for me right but when I will say
[00:06:51] numbers and we can do some examples
[00:06:53] later you're visualizing a bead
[00:06:56] representation on the Abacus in your
[00:06:58] mind y yeah because if I see if I you
[00:07:02] know say you're going to ask me to add
[00:07:03] two three-digit numbers and the first
[00:07:05] one was like
[00:07:06] 325 in my head I see the number 325
[00:07:10] right like as if I was writing it when I
[00:07:12] had to do that math uh on paper in class
[00:07:15] like that would be the first number I
[00:07:16] write from left to right and then
[00:07:19] another number would go right under it
[00:07:21] you know yeah and then I draw a little
[00:07:22] line and then uh go now I probably do it
[00:07:26] uh trying left to right I'd write the
[00:07:28] answer but I'm visually izing it on
[00:07:30] paper which I'm stuck in that way that's
[00:07:32] the way I've done it my whole life but
[00:07:34] you're saying you start with three beads
[00:07:36] two beads and a five bead on your in
[00:07:39] your mind yeah yeah it's actually funny
[00:07:42] because in school um when I was taught
[00:07:45] the long multiplication long division I
[00:07:46] never actually got the hang of it so
[00:07:48] till this day I still don't know how to
[00:07:50] do long multiplication I just do it in
[00:07:51] my head that's crazy okay um wow so
[00:07:58] let's see so so what do you study what
[00:08:01] what's your um so you're 16 I get well
[00:08:03] you're going into school uh College soon
[00:08:06] what what do you what are your interests
[00:08:09] I mean are you into math and sciences
[00:08:12] or um yeah I'm into math science uh more
[00:08:16] into like more uh into like engineering
[00:08:19] that kind of stuff and how really how
[00:08:20] machines work and stuff but I also want
[00:08:22] to kind of put myself into an area where
[00:08:25] I I can um have a financial advantage
[00:08:28] for my goals in life
[00:08:29] okay so maybe like a career where yeah
[00:08:32] it provides that National
[00:08:34] Advantage fair enough fair enough okay
[00:08:37] well uh performing on the show that you
[00:08:39] did very well in might have been a good
[00:08:41] start right
[00:08:43] yeah um so can I give you a a little
[00:08:47] test to see how you do yeah I usually
[00:08:50] write down these numbers just because so
[00:08:52] I can visualize it okay yeah that's fine
[00:08:55] um obviously we have no video here but
[00:08:57] um you can write down the numbers but
[00:08:59] I'm sure by the rapid the speed at which
[00:09:02] you say the answer it will be clear that
[00:09:04] you're not like using a calculator it's
[00:09:05] probably faster than a calculator um all
[00:09:08] right uh what should we warm up with you
[00:09:10] want to do a 2 by two
[00:09:12] multiplication uh yeah sure 2 by two is
[00:09:14] fine those are probably super easy okay
[00:09:16] let's try um 35 time
[00:09:20] 74
[00:09:22] 3574 um
[00:09:25] 2590 okay actually should check these I
[00:09:27] don't have
[00:09:29] hold
[00:09:30] on how was your memory for numbers oh um
[00:09:34] so so that's kind of why my 3x3 is kind
[00:09:38] of inconsistent cuz when I do 3x3 most
[00:09:41] likely the answer that's going to come
[00:09:42] out is a six digit number because 3 plus
[00:09:44] three right um so I try to do I try to
[00:09:47] hold three numbers on each hand and it
[00:09:48] kind of gets out of hand because I have
[00:09:50] to memorize some of the numbers which
[00:09:52] I'm not that good at okay well we need
[00:09:54] to we need to work on that I can help
[00:09:56] you um yeah so it was 2,500 90 that's
[00:10:00] correct all right let's try um a yeah
[00:10:04] three digigit by three digigit is that
[00:10:06] cool okay yeah yeah that's go all right
[00:10:09] let's go with um
[00:10:13] 736 times
[00:10:18] 9111
[00:10:24] okay 670
[00:10:28] 496 d ding ding ding that's right all
[00:10:31] right nice job um very good let's let's
[00:10:35] do one more all right all right uh
[00:10:38] trying to think of hard numbers but
[00:10:40] whatever all right
[00:10:43] 444 times
[00:10:55] 77 318 348
[00:10:59] yep that's right damn that's pretty good
[00:11:02] I mean if I tried to do that in my head
[00:11:04] I think I would I would just be very
[00:11:08] overwhelmed
[00:11:10] um so with multip so I get I get
[00:11:14] addition with with with Abacus I mean
[00:11:16] it's something you got to learn I guess
[00:11:17] but it makes sense you add beads to more
[00:11:20] beads right but so multiplication which
[00:11:22] I guess is also addition are you using
[00:11:26] any special method um are you using this
[00:11:30] crosswise and vertical method um I'm I
[00:11:34] I'm pretty sure I'm just going old
[00:11:35] school I'm just doing so with example
[00:11:37] 444 * 717 yeah I would first just
[00:11:41] multiply the first digit of the the
[00:11:43] first four times all the 717 and then go
[00:11:45] to the next one and add them up and just
[00:11:48] go down the line got it got it got it it
[00:11:50] okay interesting um and have you ever
[00:11:55] are you are you familiar with a guy
[00:11:56] named art
[00:11:58] Benjamin uh um I don't think so no you
[00:12:01] should look him up he um he has an
[00:12:03] amazing Ted talk about uh math Magics um
[00:12:08] he's a professor I think at um is it
[00:12:11] brown I don't remember I had him on the
[00:12:13] show and one of the things he does
[00:12:15] really well at the end of his show is he
[00:12:16] squares a five-digit
[00:12:19] number um and it's cool because he
[00:12:21] actually talks it how he's calculating
[00:12:23] it out loud and he has some pneumonics
[00:12:26] he uses to hold the large numbers like
[00:12:28] intermediate steps yeah I just searched
[00:12:31] him up I actually remember this guy yeah
[00:12:33] he he does show his steps through and
[00:12:35] what's interesting what I saw was yeah
[00:12:37] like you said he had pneumonics and like
[00:12:39] telling a story yeahh yeah have you uh
[00:12:43] how good are you at squaring numbers I
[00:12:46] guess you could
[00:12:47] Square what I'm not that good well you
[00:12:50] could do a 3X3 right a a three-digit
[00:12:53] Square um well so for square root
[00:12:55] numbers what I I just like I never
[00:12:57] learned like a technique how to do them
[00:12:59] so I just kind of play around with the
[00:13:00] number so I just find a number and I
[00:13:02] Square it in my head really quick and I
[00:13:04] just do like above or below and I pick a
[00:13:06] next number okay no I I didn't mean the
[00:13:08] square root or the cube root I meant to
[00:13:11] square like a three-digit number like oh
[00:13:14] 444 * 444 you could do that right yeah
[00:13:17] yeah I'll just do the like original
[00:13:19] multiplication yeah okay um the other
[00:13:23] thing that I when I met you this is what
[00:13:25] you actually had to do on the show was
[00:13:28] the w rapid adding right M yeah and
[00:13:33] so how I mean I guess when you have
[00:13:37] because for me it's hard to like I don't
[00:13:40] know I especially because you were doing
[00:13:42] two- digit numbers added to each other
[00:13:44] or three um I had one two-digit number
[00:13:47] where I uh started off and then I would
[00:13:49] add another two-digit number
[00:13:51] consistently onto that first initial
[00:13:53] number that's right yeah um and the
[00:13:55] first the starting point was chosen
[00:13:57] randomly just to make sure that you
[00:13:59] didn't have them like memorized right
[00:14:01] yeah yeah both numbers are chosen
[00:14:02] randomly yeah okay
[00:14:05] so
[00:14:06] um like for example what was it I'd give
[00:14:09] you a number say
[00:14:10] 35 right to start with and then i' give
[00:14:14] you another number to add by and you
[00:14:15] just keep going right right I would just
[00:14:17] add that number can we can we try it
[00:14:19] sure so 35 is a number and then let's
[00:14:24] try adding uh
[00:14:27] 91 okay 12621 7308 399 uh 4905 816 7276
[00:14:34] 3854 94510 36112 71 218
[00:14:39] 130914 that's crazy so yeah I'm guessing
[00:14:43] that it's much faster to just say the
[00:14:44] digits than to actually say yeah like in
[00:14:48] my head the numbers I could just add
[00:14:50] them right away and the problem if I
[00:14:53] would mess up would be saying the
[00:14:55] numbers that's cuz I would probably like
[00:14:57] say like a nine when I should be saying
[00:14:59] an eight or something which is I don't
[00:15:01] know why okay wow so I mean can you kind
[00:15:05] of walk through that process in slow
[00:15:08] motion I know that might be hard but
[00:15:09] like so I tell you 35 right so what
[00:15:13] happens in your mind um the beads just
[00:15:16] show up in my head so you see one column
[00:15:20] with three beads on it and next column
[00:15:22] with a five right yeah yeah so if for
[00:15:25] those who don't know the Abacus most
[00:15:28] abacuses I guess have um four beads on
[00:15:31] the bottom which count from 1 2 3 and
[00:15:33] four and then when you count to five the
[00:15:35] top bead which is separated by a bar
[00:15:37] gets flicked down and the other four
[00:15:40] move out of the way and that represents
[00:15:41] five and then you can add six seven
[00:15:44] eight nine with those single beads after
[00:15:47] right Y and then it's just different
[00:15:49] columns that are the units the tens the
[00:15:52] hundreds and from right to left right M
[00:15:56] okay so you have three in the in the T's
[00:15:58] Place five that one five beat and the
[00:16:01] the units right yeah okay so if you can
[00:16:05] visualize that I'll try to put something
[00:16:06] on the screen here so that people can
[00:16:07] see that and then I say let's add by 91
[00:16:11] so you don't have to go through the
[00:16:13] process of how you add it on the beads
[00:16:15] but in terms of like continuously saying
[00:16:19] the answers are
[00:16:21] you because man if I was flicking those
[00:16:24] beads in real life you know i' I'd do
[00:16:26] the move to add 91 and I'd have an
[00:16:28] answer and i' start to say it um but I I
[00:16:31] feel like I have to finish saying it
[00:16:33] before I started the next calculation
[00:16:34] but it sounds like you have to at that
[00:16:37] speed you're you're almost moving the
[00:16:39] beads not without stopping right well
[00:16:43] kind of just because like when I add
[00:16:45] numbers like I said it's muscle memory
[00:16:47] so it happens right away like I don't
[00:16:49] think about adding it I just it just
[00:16:51] happens and I just see the new number in
[00:16:52] my head so it takes time to read it but
[00:16:54] right after I'm done reading the
[00:16:56] addition happens really fast and I just
[00:16:58] read the next number I see okay God
[00:17:01] that's that's pretty interesting okay um
[00:17:04] can you do this with h three digits um
[00:17:07] yeah I could give it a try all right
[00:17:09] let's give it a try so uh let's start so
[00:17:12] can I give you a three-digit number and
[00:17:13] then to add by a three digigit number
[00:17:16] yeah sure should I say it slowly just so
[00:17:18] you can check or yeah I mean I'll check
[00:17:20] it
[00:17:20] after okay yeah um all right so let's
[00:17:24] start with
[00:17:26] 375 okay and and let's add by
[00:17:30] 45
[00:17:32] 415
[00:17:34] 790120
[00:17:36] 5162 02035 2450 2865 3280 3695 41104
[00:17:45] 5254
[00:17:47] 9404 5355 that's good that's good I mean
[00:17:50] could you keep going yeah probably right
[00:17:52] yeah it probably could okay that's funny
[00:17:55] um wow and and so what else
[00:18:00] um I mean in terms of these rapid fire
[00:18:04] um answers and calculations what else
[00:18:06] could you do in theory or have you been
[00:18:09] tested on before um I can do flash
[00:18:12] mental so like you can Flash number and
[00:18:15] I would just add those numbers
[00:18:17] consistently oh okay so they'd be
[00:18:19] flashed on screen just
[00:18:21] rapidly it okay yeah I've seen that they
[00:18:23] had that on the the same show as well a
[00:18:25] good friend of mine yir I don't know if
[00:18:27] you met him youir yeah I met him I met
[00:18:29] him at the memorial that's right yeah
[00:18:32] that's kind of his specialty was on The
[00:18:34] Ellen Show doing that which is also
[00:18:37] Beyond me I don't know how you just H
[00:18:40] I'd be I'd be left behind did you see
[00:18:42] there was so at this memoriad
[00:18:44] competition um where we both were I was
[00:18:46] doing memory stuff and you were doing
[00:18:48] the me uh mental math stuff there was a
[00:18:50] little girl during the talent show doing
[00:18:53] that did you see that um I wasn't
[00:18:56] actually at the talent show cuz I had to
[00:18:57] quickly go back toiz
[00:18:59] ah shoot okay so you were just there in
[00:19:01] and out um yeah I I think I have the
[00:19:03] video I'm going to share it here if I
[00:19:05] have it um but it was this little girl
[00:19:08] she's about four or five tiny little
[00:19:11] girl staring at a huge screen and they
[00:19:14] just blasted like 20 thre digigit
[00:19:17] numbers and she I think must have been a
[00:19:19] fraction of a section of a second that
[00:19:22] they showed it and she got the right
[00:19:24] answer at eight together it was crazy
[00:19:26] oh yeah um um so what's what's the day
[00:19:31] in the life uh of jabin I mean are you
[00:19:35] planning to do anything with this skill
[00:19:37] or you're just kind of an average kid
[00:19:39] not an average kid but like you have
[00:19:41] normal um things you just want to go to
[00:19:44] college get a degree I mean I I want to
[00:19:48] really like like do something with the
[00:19:50] skill and kind of like show the world
[00:19:52] somehow you know maybe like on different
[00:19:54] TV shows like I kind of like show the
[00:19:56] skill cuz only like the people in in my
[00:19:59] city basically like only my friends know
[00:20:00] that I have the skill and not even all
[00:20:02] my friends know I have the
[00:20:04] skill yeah well I think wants to show
[00:20:07] errors that might
[00:20:08] change so fingers crossed and I hope
[00:20:11] that it does for you um let me ask you
[00:20:14] so I'm getting older I might have
[00:20:17] children uh in the next 5 to 10 years I
[00:20:21] want my kid to be really mathematically
[00:20:25] clever like have a great number sense
[00:20:27] that's really important to me
[00:20:29] uh not just because I want that for him
[00:20:31] but for that kid to to be good with
[00:20:35] numbers I think is an invaluable skill
[00:20:37] so would you recommend that he learn or
[00:20:40] she learn um via the same way you did or
[00:20:44] do you think have do you feel like
[00:20:46] you've missed out on something not
[00:20:48] learning say the traditional way are
[00:20:51] there any are there any like
[00:20:53] drawbacks I feel like cuz I started very
[00:20:56] young like my mom wanted to put me in
[00:20:58] four the age requirement so like she
[00:21:00] wanted to put me in I was four and that
[00:21:01] was five is the age requirement I feel
[00:21:04] like starting young is preferbly like
[00:21:07] the the most preferable option just
[00:21:08] because when you learn in school the
[00:21:10] numbers and how to count with fingers
[00:21:12] that's what you're going to do when you
[00:21:13] start later with Abacus and you're not
[00:21:16] going to really like focus on the
[00:21:17] techniques as if you would start early
[00:21:20] that's the only technique you know so
[00:21:22] you have to use that technique right but
[00:21:24] I guess my question is are there any
[00:21:27] situations you found yourself in whether
[00:21:29] it's in class or out there in the real
[00:21:31] world where you're given a word problem
[00:21:34] or some situation that involves numbers
[00:21:36] that the advocus method that you
[00:21:39] know uh was
[00:21:41] trickier um I don't think so yeah I
[00:21:45] don't think so okay yeah I mean it's it
[00:21:49] makes sense that there'd be no issues
[00:21:51] but I'm just asking you know because
[00:21:53] yeah um you hear all this stuff you ever
[00:21:56] heard about common core math um no oh my
[00:21:59] God okay yeah do yourself a favor and
[00:22:01] look it up and you will laugh to tears
[00:22:04] um but you'll also cry because this is I
[00:22:07] guess what um a lot of schools are um
[00:22:10] forced to um have their teachers teach
[00:22:14] the kids and it's the most
[00:22:16] backwards um roundabout way of teaching
[00:22:19] mathematics it's insane that this stuff
[00:22:21] is out there but um you know they swear
[00:22:24] by it and they have standards to meet
[00:22:26] these teachers so they teach it and I
[00:22:28] feel sorry for the kid that has to learn
[00:22:30] that because they are going to be having
[00:22:32] a hard time you know when they have to
[00:22:34] like calculate uh the tip on a bill or
[00:22:37] do their taxes or whatever when they get
[00:22:38] older um so in that case that teaching
[00:22:42] that is bad in my opinion um but I guess
[00:22:44] learning from the Abacus there's really
[00:22:46] no drawback um that's pretty cool to
[00:22:49] know I mean I'm going to definitely look
[00:22:51] into that when my kid gets old
[00:22:54] enough um well that's great so what's uh
[00:22:58] are you are there competitions uh that
[00:23:01] you are lined up to do and I don't think
[00:23:03] there are that many right there's this
[00:23:05] mad that happen I guess there's the
[00:23:07] mental calculation World Cup every so
[00:23:10] often but I don't know if you do
[00:23:12] those um I I've only participated in
[00:23:15] competitions locally like hosted by the
[00:23:18] institution that I went to to learn
[00:23:20] Abacus okay cuz I mean no one else
[00:23:23] really in this state like does advocates
[00:23:26] so I don't know anything about it and I
[00:23:28] I never there is the like World mental
[00:23:30] competitions in this world yeah there's
[00:23:33] one in Germany I think every two years
[00:23:35] or
[00:23:36] something oh you should check it out
[00:23:38] it's similar to the events that they
[00:23:39] have at memoriad but it's all on paper
[00:23:42] oh okay yeah so it's like the addition
[00:23:44] the multiplication the division uh not
[00:23:48] the division the square rooting and
[00:23:50] calendar dates I
[00:23:52] believe okay yeah um well great um I I
[00:23:57] just wanted to do a little quick
[00:23:59] check in with you and then talk about
[00:24:00] your amazing skill what is um I'm going
[00:24:04] to ask do you have a website do you have
[00:24:06] anything anywhere any people can reach
[00:24:08] you I I have Facebook I have social
[00:24:10] media that's it okay all right well you
[00:24:13] got to get on that because you're about
[00:24:14] to blow up I tell you when this show
[00:24:16] starts and it shows your showcases your
[00:24:19] uh talents which the audience loved I
[00:24:22] tell you they were like half asleep
[00:24:23] until you went on um I mean yours was
[00:24:26] pretty cool the show was mine was cool
[00:24:28] because they made it look like flashy
[00:24:31] the I was just dropped from the ceiling
[00:24:33] but uh yours was actually super
[00:24:35] impressive cuz it was impressive um but
[00:24:38] anyways
[00:24:39] thanks um all right cool I'll share your
[00:24:42] information if people are interested is
[00:24:44] it cool if they reach out to you I'm
[00:24:45] sure some people are fascinated by what
[00:24:48] you can do and maybe want to learn more
[00:24:50] about um these schools with the applicat
[00:24:52] or whatever yeah yeah sure awesome
[00:24:56] thanks for being on the show jabin uh I
[00:24:59] hope to see you in the future and um I'm
[00:25:02] sure you'll uh go to some amazing
[00:25:04] college and do some awesome stuff so in
[00:25:06] the meantime um yeah I'll see you later
[00:25:10] all right see you thanks see you

=== Nelson Dellis' MIND SHOW - Anthony Brooks // Speed Cubing Champ ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhRaLDrYgBw

[00:00:09] [Music]
[00:00:14] what's up guys
[00:00:16] Nelson Dellis here for another episode
[00:00:18] of the mind show and before I talk about
[00:00:20] my guests I want to quickly thank my
[00:00:22] sponsor extreme memory challenge.com and
[00:00:26] it's a project that I'm really involved
[00:00:28] with where we're trying to get million
[00:00:30] test-takers to take this memory test
[00:00:32] that we designed very easy very quick
[00:00:34] free know very minimal commitment all
[00:00:39] you'd be doing is taking a memory test
[00:00:40] and helping out with our research the
[00:00:43] goal is to find people with exceptional
[00:00:45] long-term memories and with that we can
[00:00:47] genetically test them and hopefully
[00:00:49] figure out how to cure a lot of these
[00:00:52] cognitive disabling diseases like
[00:00:53] Alzheimer's dementia Parkinson's and so
[00:00:56] on so please check it out extreme memory
[00:00:58] challenge calm I think we're at about
[00:01:01] just over 10,000 test takers which is
[00:01:04] great but we're trying to get a million
[00:01:07] the more people we get the better
[00:01:09] mapping of the brain and memory
[00:01:11] long-term memory of the world that we
[00:01:14] can get do that now our guest today is a
[00:01:19] master of one of these things so years
[00:01:22] ago before I was into memory I was
[00:01:24] solving these things pretty quickly not
[00:01:27] as quick as him this was kind of what my
[00:01:30] thing was so actually in my memory
[00:01:33] system my number is 12 I am 12 my image
[00:01:36] for that number is me and my object is a
[00:01:40] Rubik's Cube for that reason so I'm very
[00:01:42] passionate about the process of getting
[00:01:45] good at speed cubing and so today we
[00:01:49] have a speed cubing champ
[00:01:50] named Anthony Brooks I met him last
[00:01:53] summer in LA when we were shooting a
[00:01:55] show together and he is fast and yeah
[00:02:00] really fast and he's a all-around cool
[00:02:02] super cool guy so let's dive into it
[00:02:05] really excited about this episode he's
[00:02:07] fascinating guy and I'd love to hear him
[00:02:09] talk about the cube like it's no
[00:02:11] [Music]
[00:02:12] so here we go hello and welcome everyone
[00:02:16] to another episode of the mind show with
[00:02:18] Lee Nelson Dellis I'm your host us
[00:02:21] memory champion and today we have a
[00:02:23] speed cubing champion rubik's cube
[00:02:26] champion Anthony Brooks thanks for being
[00:02:28] on the show how you doing I'm good
[00:02:31] thanks for having me
[00:02:32] yeah man so you and I we met back this
[00:02:36] past summer I think we were filming for
[00:02:39] a oh that's hopefully gonna go on air
[00:02:42] soon the what was it called superhuman
[00:02:45] yeah no no for less even say that word
[00:02:48] but uh yeah so you know I I got really
[00:02:52] excited when I saw that you could do a
[00:02:55] full Rubik's Cube solved in a single
[00:02:57] snapchat video that really excited me
[00:03:00] because the snapchat video is not very
[00:03:02] long so ever since that I mean we've
[00:03:05] talked on and off but uh I've always
[00:03:08] been interested in cubing that's
[00:03:09] actually where I started getting into
[00:03:10] like memory stuff and then Rubik's Cube
[00:03:14] yeah yeah I mean I was in a physics lab
[00:03:18] and we we would just do random nerdy
[00:03:21] things and one things were like let's
[00:03:22] solve Rubik's cubes and I learned about
[00:03:25] the memory that goes into blind solves
[00:03:28] and then I dropped the Rubik's Cube and
[00:03:30] just with good memory stuff so anyways
[00:03:33] um I'd love to start just by kind of
[00:03:36] getting into how you started like what
[00:03:38] was your first experience with the cube
[00:03:40] how did you get interested into it yeah
[00:03:44] pretty similar to your story it sounds
[00:03:46] like I went to a very math and science
[00:03:49] oriented high school and this was back
[00:03:53] right around when the pursuit of
[00:03:55] happiness came out with little Smith
[00:03:57] yeah do you see that movie I literally
[00:04:00] watched that clip where he solves the
[00:04:01] cube just a week ago I love it okay yeah
[00:04:04] so so that kind of got people all across
[00:04:08] North America I would at Walmart buying
[00:04:11] Rubik's cubes going on to YouTube to
[00:04:13] learning how to solve it and next thing
[00:04:16] you know there's a maple Rubik's Cube
[00:04:17] craze at my school literally dozens of
[00:04:20] people like it was it was
[00:04:23] freshman year of high school and I
[00:04:24] remember I showed up after Christmas
[00:04:27] break and I did see a couple of kids
[00:04:30] playing with Rubik's cubes but I don't
[00:04:31] remember anybody solving it and then we
[00:04:34] show up first day we have like an hour
[00:04:36] break before school starts and everybody
[00:04:39] just kind of walks around mingling and
[00:04:40] everywhere I went people were solving
[00:04:42] Rubik's cubes so that kind of threw me
[00:04:45] off a little bit I mean easily jump into
[00:04:48] a whole cubing thing but uh a few months
[00:04:51] later I have a long road trip to run a
[00:04:54] half marathon and it was ten hours stuck
[00:04:57] on a bus we were really bored there's
[00:05:01] only so much I don't know game boys you
[00:05:04] can play in that amount of time one of
[00:05:07] my buddies was the fastest at my school
[00:05:09] and I've always been super competitive
[00:05:12] so he taught me a few other people how
[00:05:15] to solve the cube and then it was about
[00:05:18] six months later that I competed in my
[00:05:21] first competition and that's that was
[00:05:23] really my introduction to this whole
[00:05:25] world of speed cubing nice and then so
[00:05:28] how fast was your friend at that time
[00:05:29] said to solve um he was under a minute
[00:05:32] which I thought was pretty damn good
[00:05:37] it's really interesting to me that
[00:05:39] cubing is one of those things that even
[00:05:41] if you just pick it up and learn how to
[00:05:43] solve a cube it you need five minutes
[00:05:45] that's gonna really impress 99 percent
[00:05:48] of people you meet
[00:05:49] yeah oh I don't know why I've spent so
[00:05:52] much time trying to get any better than
[00:05:53] that
[00:05:54] but there I had the same issue right
[00:05:58] when I first started memorizing decks of
[00:06:00] cards you know I was obsessed with
[00:06:01] trying to do it in front of people to
[00:06:03] show them and I would just try to do it
[00:06:05] as fast as possible with one look and
[00:06:07] that's impressive you know I'm talking
[00:06:09] about like 40 seconds 50 seconds but I
[00:06:11] make mistakes all the time so I'd be so
[00:06:13] nervous and they'd be like it's not a
[00:06:15] president you can't memorize the deck
[00:06:16] but then so I learned that there there's
[00:06:19] like a level where you can go slow
[00:06:20] enough but it's slow for me but fast
[00:06:23] enough for them to be still impressed
[00:06:25] and you get them all right you know it's
[00:06:26] really something that I can't grapple
[00:06:29] with is that solving a cube in 20
[00:06:34] seconds
[00:06:34] is
[00:06:35] fast a lot faster than two or three
[00:06:37] minutes the 20 seconds is fast and 15
[00:06:40] seconds is fast but within this Rubik's
[00:06:43] Cube community world class is really
[00:06:46] under 10 seconds and even if I sold the
[00:06:50] qubit in seven eight seconds a lot of
[00:06:53] times people will be counting out loud
[00:06:54] will be one two three four or five they
[00:06:56] told me it's 15 seconds
[00:06:58] it's high it's hard for people to really
[00:07:02] notice the difference between nine
[00:07:05] seconds and even 19 seconds rather
[00:07:08] alright what's the current world record
[00:07:10] is it like four point something yeah
[00:07:13] it's a world record dipped under four
[00:07:16] seconds just this last year and
[00:07:18] personally under five seconds
[00:07:21] it was 4.9 for a while and then in
[00:07:24] November it dropped to four point seven
[00:07:28] four okay and that in December somebody
[00:07:32] lowered it to four point seven three oh
[00:07:35] that's good are these of these averages
[00:07:38] or is that like a single one of you
[00:07:41] thought yeah that's a single soul so
[00:07:44] difference between single and averages
[00:07:47] really that you know single times you
[00:07:50] can skip steps and get lucky I don't
[00:07:52] really know if that happens with like
[00:07:54] decks of cards when you memo because I
[00:07:57] don't think you can skip anything you
[00:07:59] can get a nice setup right but right now
[00:08:02] they don't do that there have been cases
[00:08:03] where like a deck wasn't shuffled so you
[00:08:05] get like the automatic you know Ace to
[00:08:07] King ace to case the king but in that
[00:08:10] case they know that it was it shuffled
[00:08:12] because when you reconstructed it's too
[00:08:14] closely they redo it obviously you don't
[00:08:16] even have to look at it but the thing is
[00:08:19] even if it was say that fresh deck order
[00:08:22] you know Ace to King all the suits and
[00:08:24] you maybe move two or three cards that
[00:08:26] still would be hard because you it would
[00:08:29] probably be even harder because you
[00:08:30] suddenly have to figure out you know
[00:08:32] without memorizing where those cards
[00:08:35] were switched or stuff I don't know
[00:08:37] and just because there'd be so much of a
[00:08:38] pattern if you try to memorize it it
[00:08:40] would probably be a headache but so they
[00:08:43] don't really run into that issue they
[00:08:45] usually just shuffle a shitload of times
[00:08:47] then that's good enough you know yeah
[00:08:50] okay so so yes I guess so let's let's
[00:08:54] talk about how people what what
[00:08:56] competitions are like because I guess
[00:08:57] most people don't under
[00:09:00] is and and different kinds of
[00:09:02] competitions and events they have what's
[00:09:04] a competition like yeah so there's a
[00:09:08] pretty wide spectrum of competition
[00:09:11] environments my first competition was at
[00:09:15] a library of Cincinnati Ohio
[00:09:17] this was in 2008 and cubing it felt
[00:09:23] pretty big at the time but it's a lot
[00:09:25] bigger now back then I'd say the average
[00:09:28] competition had about 60 or so
[00:09:31] competitors but right now we're looking
[00:09:34] at probably about a hundred competitors
[00:09:37] on average at these competitions there's
[00:09:41] I'm competing here in Vancouver tomorrow
[00:09:43] and there's going to be a hundred and
[00:09:45] fifty competitors okay cool so every
[00:09:49] competition there'll be different events
[00:09:51] in total they're about 15 different
[00:09:54] events ranging from the standard queue
[00:09:58] to smaller versions this is a two by two
[00:10:01] then you know it gets bigger four by
[00:10:03] four five by five all the way up to a
[00:10:06] seven by seven then there are a few
[00:10:08] different shapes like a pyramid tube and
[00:10:11] stuff like that okay
[00:10:12] so generally at competitions will be a
[00:10:16] set list of events that are held and
[00:10:18] will be a few rounds of each event so
[00:10:22] going off the standard cube
[00:10:25] I'd say tomorrow in Vancouver most
[00:10:29] people will be solving the cube in under
[00:10:31] 45 seconds okay I would say it'll
[00:10:34] probably will probably take about a 25
[00:10:38] second average to advance the second
[00:10:41] round okay then probably about a 12
[00:10:44] second average to make it to the finals
[00:10:46] so there's like three rounds and then
[00:10:49] you get what five attempts per right
[00:10:52] okay five attempts your fastest sold and
[00:10:56] your slowest solve or thrown out and you
[00:10:58] take the average of the mid
[00:11:00] three times cool and then do you start
[00:11:03] going I say you can screwin up but in
[00:11:09] competition there's actually thinking
[00:11:13] back when I started cubing if a piece
[00:11:16] popped out of the cube which used to
[00:11:19] happen a lot more back then because the
[00:11:20] hardware wasn't as good yeah it popped
[00:11:23] out they give you a redo now what
[00:11:25] happens is you don't get to redo this
[00:11:27] all but that one counts as your worst
[00:11:28] song in your drum and then tossing out
[00:11:31] your best selves means that if you get
[00:11:33] insanely lucky on one it's not gonna
[00:11:35] yeah you know yeah yeah exactly that's
[00:11:40] crazy
[00:11:41] and then so who who mixes it up or is it
[00:11:44] does everyone get the same mix as it
[00:11:46] done very early or is it all random so
[00:11:51] we have a computer program that will
[00:11:53] generate a totally random scramble that
[00:11:56] everyone will get so they'll be
[00:11:58] designated scramblers that the way it
[00:12:02] works this will be a piece of paper with
[00:12:04] a competitor's name on it the events at
[00:12:06] sift scorecard where they write all the
[00:12:07] times down and they'll place their
[00:12:09] puzzle solved on the card and then a
[00:12:12] scrambler will get that they'll follow
[00:12:14] the string of letters that you know
[00:12:16] dictates rice scramble it and then
[00:12:19] everybody has the same starting spot
[00:12:21] okay that's that's cool and then I
[00:12:25] assume it's the same in memory
[00:12:27] competitions right well they have the
[00:12:28] same same like shuffle Decker sometimes
[00:12:32] I mean in the World Championships
[00:12:35] everybody just randomly shuffles the
[00:12:37] thing with cards is I guess I don't know
[00:12:40] how compared to Rubik's Cube but it's
[00:12:44] they're all as equally complex when you
[00:12:46] shuffle enough I think but in in the
[00:12:50] u.s. championship the finals is on stage
[00:12:52] and they've given us all the same decks
[00:12:55] to memorize because we have to say them
[00:12:57] in order now we're we're pulling from
[00:12:59] the same memory of the same deck so it
[00:13:02] needs to do the same but the other one
[00:13:04] at the World Championships you this
[00:13:05] memorizing as fast as you can
[00:13:08] you know as fast as a loan you know a
[00:13:11] training table so
[00:13:13] but I guess everybody has I mean you
[00:13:17] know different codes for for the like
[00:13:20] the pairs of cards right even if you
[00:13:22] have to save shuffle deck it's not
[00:13:23] really gonna yeah exactly I remember
[00:13:26] like in 2013 or something one of the
[00:13:29] decks I didn't get a ride and missed a
[00:13:31] cart but it started off so good and for
[00:13:33] me so good means it was like an image of
[00:13:37] me an image of me climbing and it was
[00:13:40] like the perfect story like was like
[00:13:42] super designed for me to memorize you
[00:13:45] know and if someone else I got that
[00:13:47] maybe it would have been their worst
[00:13:48] images or something you know in sequence
[00:13:50] so it's a there's no way to really tell
[00:13:52] that so that's why I don't think it's as
[00:13:55] done the same you know
[00:14:03] are we there yeah a little bit yeah with
[00:14:09] cubing it everybody most people who use
[00:14:12] a very similar method so even if we use
[00:14:15] slightly different algorithms the start
[00:14:18] of the solve is almost always the same
[00:14:22] idea you can do it a little bit
[00:14:23] differently yeah but that's part of the
[00:14:25] reason why it's really important that we
[00:14:27] do have the same randomized scramble
[00:14:30] okay because it can I mean each scramble
[00:14:34] makes a huge difference at the very
[00:14:36] beginning of the sole the middle and the
[00:14:38] end are influenced by what you do at the
[00:14:40] beginning so it's it's hard to end up
[00:14:43] with the same ending of each soul but
[00:14:46] the beginnings what's really important
[00:14:48] got it and then before you do your time
[00:14:50] solved can you look at the cube or it's
[00:14:53] just time to as you start to look at it
[00:14:55] yeah we get up to 15 seconds so look at
[00:15:00] the cube before starting okay yeah cool
[00:15:02] and then and this we can segue into the
[00:15:04] strategy but I guess at that point your
[00:15:07] is everyone starting with looking for
[00:15:09] that cross the first layer cross that
[00:15:11] just about everybody there are a couple
[00:15:14] other methods that don't start with that
[00:15:16] cross but I would say 99% of people at
[00:15:20] these competitions are all looking for
[00:15:21] that cross okay but but then something
[00:15:25] that
[00:15:26] it's kind of interesting about money
[00:15:29] solving when I compete is I bet I bet
[00:15:31] you learned how to solve McHugh starting
[00:15:33] with that white cross yeah yeah I did
[00:15:36] yeah mix logos on them white he's got to
[00:15:40] start there and you know everybody
[00:15:44] teaches that in videos online so people
[00:15:46] have ended up using white but when I was
[00:15:48] taught I didn't learn from video my
[00:15:51] friend taught me and they said you can
[00:15:52] start with whatever color you want so I
[00:15:55] ended up doing blue weird yeah and
[00:16:04] what's interesting about it is it
[00:16:08] inevitably either gives me
[00:16:12] the variance is there but it'll either
[00:16:14] give me an advantage or a disadvantage
[00:16:16] because everyone else is using whites so
[00:16:20] if white has really bad scrambles for
[00:16:23] their cross at the beginning and blue is
[00:16:26] good I have an advantage I said yeah but
[00:16:29] but then there are times where after
[00:16:31] around people are talking and I hear
[00:16:33] everybody will will be going on and on
[00:16:35] about how great the scrambles were like
[00:16:39] kicking myself
[00:16:41] interesting interesting so what's the
[00:16:43] opposite of the blue side then what's
[00:16:45] the green okay so Green is your last
[00:16:47] that's your what yeah tell me how you
[00:16:50] what's the very basic way to solve it
[00:16:53] and then tell me how you solve it I mean
[00:16:55] I've done it but I wanted to hear from
[00:16:57] you sure so basic way is starting with a
[00:17:04] cross and you know I do blue so there's
[00:17:06] my blue cross on the bottom
[00:17:07] after this I'm sure you put in the
[00:17:10] corners of the bottom layer that's right
[00:17:12] yeah and then probably be the edges in
[00:17:15] the middle layer yeah okay so going
[00:17:19] through that right now I'll show you
[00:17:20] what it kind of looks like there's one
[00:17:22] two and you'll notice I'm doing a lot of
[00:17:25] noobs for this so there's three four so
[00:17:29] that was maybe 30 moves to solve the
[00:17:32] bottom bottom layer of the cube right
[00:17:34] here and you also didn't really like
[00:17:36] look at it while you
[00:17:38] no it's really cool to watch you do it
[00:17:41] it's just like pulling triggers and
[00:17:42] stuff but you know I have a really good
[00:17:44] sense that I think where everything is
[00:17:46] right yeah like using a basic method the
[00:17:50] method I use which I'll get into
[00:17:51] requires looking at many more pieces at
[00:17:54] once okay so if I'm reducing it to just
[00:17:57] the basics its I know where everything
[00:18:00] is so now when I put in this this second
[00:18:03] layer that's eight moves there
[00:18:06] kaitlin's there eight more gate more and
[00:18:09] now I have two layers of acute yep then
[00:18:13] for here the the most basic method that
[00:18:17] most people will learn on YouTube
[00:18:19] requires about I'd say eight steps to
[00:18:23] solve the last layer from this point and
[00:18:26] most world-class speed cubers are doing
[00:18:30] the last layer in two steps
[00:18:31] so the step I would use here is first to
[00:18:36] make it all green on top so I recognize
[00:18:38] this pattern and do those moves to make
[00:18:41] make the green side come together and
[00:18:43] then the last step is just position the
[00:18:46] remaining pieces of left the top layer
[00:18:48] and the cube solved you make it look so
[00:18:51] smooth and be basically what I've been
[00:18:58] doing this entire last year which some
[00:19:01] people think I'm crazy for is developing
[00:19:04] this conceptual system called CB now
[00:19:09] this is something I'm feeling you'll
[00:19:11] like this because it's all about memory
[00:19:13] okay basically ZB is a system where I
[00:19:19] start with the cross just like normal
[00:19:22] but from here um first off instead of
[00:19:26] solving the corners of the bottom layer
[00:19:28] and then the edges of the middle layer I
[00:19:30] do those at the same time okay which is
[00:19:33] pretty standard for advanced speed
[00:19:36] cubing yes I'm gonna try to get into
[00:19:39] that I mean I got some before and then I
[00:19:41] stopped it yeah yeah yeah it's it just
[00:19:45] takes practice to kind of figure out how
[00:19:48] everything works cuz it's much easier to
[00:19:51] do this intuitive
[00:19:52] than it is to wear an algorithms for it
[00:19:54] I remember that I mean it took a while
[00:19:55] to get that intuition but once you've
[00:19:57] got it up it slides in this way it made
[00:19:59] a lot of sense as you go yeah yeah it
[00:20:02] does
[00:20:03] so I'm going through and at this point
[00:20:07] I've sold three of the four slots of the
[00:20:12] bottom layer and basically what I mean
[00:20:14] is I set it up here I've got blue on
[00:20:18] bottom and this is done this is done and
[00:20:22] it's done
[00:20:23] but the fourth slot in the bottom layer
[00:20:26] isn't done yet okay so what zeebee does
[00:20:31] is once I've solved three of the four
[00:20:34] slots I've learned 800 algorithms to
[00:20:38] solve it in only two steps from this
[00:20:41] point the rest of the cube the rest of
[00:20:43] the cube in two algorithms okay so for
[00:20:46] this first what I'm going to do is I'm
[00:20:49] going to solve this final slot and I'm
[00:20:52] going to make sure that I have a green
[00:20:54] cross on top when I do that so that case
[00:20:58] is that so now I have two layers done
[00:21:01] and I have a cross on top yeah
[00:21:05] now the the gist of what CB is is first
[00:21:12] orienting this green cross and then you
[00:21:17] know I've memorized every position that
[00:21:20] I could possibly have at this point so I
[00:21:22] can finish it in one algorithm which is
[00:21:24] an additional 500 cases so when I see
[00:21:28] this I recognize this specific pattern
[00:21:31] and I know to do that and the cube step
[00:21:35] the cubes oh wow
[00:21:36] and so did you invent that ice or is
[00:21:41] inspired by okay yeah yeah the concept
[00:21:44] has been around since 2002 okay and
[00:21:47] there have been a few people before me
[00:21:49] who have attempted to learn the system
[00:21:52] there are a couple people who did come
[00:21:55] complete most of the system as I said
[00:22:00] there are two cepsa CB and the Muslim
[00:22:03] coordinate one is those 500 patterns at
[00:22:06] the very end and busted and the people
[00:22:08] who have learned those 500 patterns
[00:22:10] haven't been very fast with it because
[00:22:13] there's so much to recall and one of the
[00:22:15] big issues was that the algorithms
[00:22:18] weren't very finger trick friendly so
[00:22:20] you couldn't execute them very quickly
[00:22:22] okay um and a year and a half ago I met
[00:22:26] a guy named Jeff Ari
[00:22:29] Jabari he had started cubing about a
[00:22:31] year before and he was living in South
[00:22:34] Africa for a year
[00:22:35] okay and while he was in South Africa I
[00:22:38] think he had just finished high school
[00:22:40] in the States
[00:22:41] and his family was living there for a
[00:22:43] year and he wasn't in school so the I
[00:22:47] think my understanding is his family
[00:22:50] basically said learn stuff yeah you know
[00:22:52] be productive but do what you want okay
[00:22:56] and Jabari started developing this DD
[00:22:59] system in terms of finding faster
[00:23:02] algorithms okay so when I met Jabari he
[00:23:06] adesh learning those 500 algorithms and
[00:23:10] that kind of inspired needed to get into
[00:23:13] it and try and make those algorithms
[00:23:15] even better so he and I have worked
[00:23:17] together and at this point we have very
[00:23:20] fast algorithms for all of these cases
[00:23:22] and I've been developing the previous
[00:23:26] stack to be just as good and the idea
[00:23:31] behind this is ultimately I think this
[00:23:34] could be a better system than what we're
[00:23:36] using right now it retires one last step
[00:23:40] and even though there's a lot more to
[00:23:42] memorize and a lot more to recognize and
[00:23:45] execute it's a lot harder basically it's
[00:23:48] like it's probably 20 times harder than
[00:23:51] the next most advanced system
[00:23:53] everybody's using but I think after a
[00:23:55] few years of practice it'll be better go
[00:23:58] so I just finished learning this system
[00:24:01] and right now I'm trying to put it into
[00:24:04] use and what I mean competition if I get
[00:24:08] good cases for this system I get really
[00:24:11] fast time so okay but if I get bad cases
[00:24:16] it's it's hard to post you know my best
[00:24:20] averages in competition so great now
[00:24:23] there's definitely a trade off and I'm
[00:24:25] working to to try and bring my average
[00:24:28] time down with bugs Nessa yes yeah and
[00:24:32] so you said you have to memorize well
[00:24:34] learn means memorize right well first is
[00:24:36] to memorize and then is to be able to do
[00:24:38] it without thinking at some point
[00:24:40] exactly but how many things is 800 or
[00:24:43] even 800 and how long are those
[00:24:47] sequences those algorithms yeah about 12
[00:24:52] moves on average okay interesting and so
[00:24:56] next question has a memory athlete how
[00:24:58] are you memorizing them is it more of
[00:25:01] just like do you have a system for that
[00:25:03] or you just like sitting there doing the
[00:25:06] same set of moves getting muscle memory
[00:25:09] how you doing it yeah so initially I
[00:25:17] grouped the algorithms into similar
[00:25:20] cases oh yeah so that every time I get a
[00:25:24] case that looks kind of like this I know
[00:25:27] that I knew an algorithm for it every
[00:25:29] type of clever so so that's the first
[00:25:32] step to group everything then once I've
[00:25:34] grouped them I just drill the algorithms
[00:25:37] over and over and over again yeah
[00:25:40] but that kind of starts with because
[00:25:42] there are so many it's hard to get them
[00:25:44] all in your muscle memory right away
[00:25:45] yeah for sure so I'll break key
[00:25:48] algorithms down and try and understand
[00:25:50] what's happening okay so generally you
[00:25:53] can track a few pieces and see where
[00:25:56] they're going so I'll try and I mean I
[00:26:00] don't translate it into letters like I
[00:26:03] would with a lot of memory stuff for
[00:26:05] blindfolded solving okay but in my head
[00:26:08] it's almost like I come up with a sort
[00:26:09] of story of what's happening with the
[00:26:12] pieces yeah okay yeah I see okay these
[00:26:15] go there that goes here they come back
[00:26:17] and once I've got that down I'll just
[00:26:21] drill them over and over again until
[00:26:23] they start to
[00:26:24] muscle memory yeah and then once they're
[00:26:29] in my muscle memory which they all are
[00:26:32] at this point at this point all the
[00:26:33] nerve muscle memory I don't have to
[00:26:35] think about them when I'm executing them
[00:26:37] what I'm having to think a lot about
[00:26:40] right now is recognizing the case that I
[00:26:45] have and associating it with that
[00:26:48] specific algorithm oh yeah
[00:26:50] so so I might have the algorithm down
[00:26:53] where I can do without thinking about it
[00:26:55] but I have to know when I see this its
[00:26:58] algorithm that I have to do right all
[00:27:00] right I don't
[00:27:02] so the you have to recognize then this
[00:27:05] is basically where the stickers are
[00:27:07] right like when you see in okay and I
[00:27:09] from what it sounds like I mean it's I
[00:27:12] remember the one where I had to remember
[00:27:14] like the shape of things was the yellow
[00:27:17] on the last layer you know we looked
[00:27:20] like a fish and then was like a little
[00:27:23] box with a little tail you know those
[00:27:26] are the things that are yeah exactly and
[00:27:28] Jesus that was like big good was I had
[00:27:32] that I was ready to I could make the
[00:27:34] whole thing yeah exactly so is it that
[00:27:39] you gotta kind of come up with like a
[00:27:41] cue for like oh that's this case this
[00:27:44] looks like do you have stuff like that
[00:27:46] where it's like this reminds me of my
[00:27:47] this is the grandma you know it wasn't
[00:27:51] until I had memorized maybe 600 of these
[00:27:56] that I realized it might have been
[00:27:59] helpful to name these things oh yeah
[00:28:02] because I think interesting I'd like to
[00:28:05] hear your two cents on this but I have
[00:28:07] just been brute-forcing it where I see
[00:28:10] the position of the colors and it's very
[00:28:13] abstract I just see the position and I
[00:28:16] need to know the moves
[00:28:17] but I was thinking you know if I had
[00:28:19] called this I don't know train right had
[00:28:23] ridden train down next to the algorithm
[00:28:26] I I was wondering if that would help
[00:28:28] with Association I think it might yeah I
[00:28:30] would have done that well I would have
[00:28:32] first try to keep the words as small as
[00:28:35] possible
[00:28:36] you
[00:28:36] like a syllable or something you know
[00:28:38] like train is good enough but um you
[00:28:41] know like mom or shoe or whatever you
[00:28:43] know all these like very simple things
[00:28:45] that you can quickly say in your head
[00:28:46] without losing too much time when you
[00:28:48] recognize it but yeah that would yeah I
[00:28:52] think that would have definitely helped
[00:28:53] in terms of but you'd also have to in
[00:28:58] the way that the positioning of the
[00:29:00] cubes and the stickers looks somehow
[00:29:02] relate it to a trainer or yes but I mean
[00:29:06] that can be as stretched out as you want
[00:29:08] I mean it may look nothing like a train
[00:29:09] but you say like oh there's like a run
[00:29:11] of of yellow on the top here that
[00:29:13] reminds me of a train track and that's
[00:29:15] good enough yeah and be like oh that's
[00:29:16] the Train one you know yeah interesting
[00:29:20] so what is so I'm guessing in
[00:29:24] competitions like tomorrow are you gonna
[00:29:27] use this or do you still kind of fall
[00:29:28] back on what you're you know we'll get
[00:29:30] you the good times for sure yeah so like
[00:29:36] I mentioned earlier I groups all of
[00:29:38] these cases yeah so there are seven
[00:29:42] generals groups of cases and I've found
[00:29:46] that the ones I've been using the
[00:29:48] longest the ones I learned first I'm
[00:29:51] stronger with right now than the ones I
[00:29:54] learned towards the tail-end so of the
[00:29:58] seven groups this is a good conversation
[00:30:03] for me to have right now I need to
[00:30:04] figure this out in competition I've been
[00:30:06] trying to use five of the seven groups
[00:30:10] okay but there are two groups that two
[00:30:15] of those five that sometimes still slow
[00:30:18] me down so I think it might be good for
[00:30:22] me to use three of the seven tomorrow
[00:30:25] there's a there's a guy coming up from
[00:30:28] Seattle his name is Kevin and he's he's
[00:30:32] a world champion cuber and the the
[00:30:35] larger cubes okay so he's very fast the
[00:30:38] standard cube but his specialty is the
[00:30:40] six by six to seven by seven okay and
[00:30:43] it's probably in my best interest to not
[00:30:47] use this full system
[00:30:49] against Kevin tomorrow so thinking
[00:30:52] through it out loud right now I think
[00:30:55] I'll definitely use about half of the
[00:30:57] system but but now I get into the issue
[00:31:02] if if I'm only gonna use half of a
[00:31:05] system then is probably in my best
[00:31:08] interest to not use the first half all
[00:31:11] right so it's really a case-by-case
[00:31:15] basis and in general and pretty good
[00:31:18] just going with the flow of this all and
[00:31:21] doing whatever feels right at the time
[00:31:24] which usually works out pretty well but
[00:31:27] it should I just know that there is
[00:31:30] definitely there's doing what I'm doing
[00:31:36] right now is slowing me down in general
[00:31:39] than if I had this system refined sure
[00:31:42] so actually last month I was in South
[00:31:46] Africa for a couple of competitions and
[00:31:48] after winning those I actually bumped up
[00:31:52] to first first place in the world
[00:31:55] rankings for most competitions walk no
[00:31:57] way oh yeah so I saw that
[00:31:59] congratulations
[00:32:02] so what I'm thinking right now I have
[00:32:06] four more competitions lined up in the
[00:32:08] next month and a half okay but I think
[00:32:10] once I have got through those I'm
[00:32:12] probably gonna take a break from
[00:32:14] competing until the world championship
[00:32:17] this summer with the idea being that I
[00:32:21] can finally stop fighting this yeah stop
[00:32:25] fighting this constant struggle between
[00:32:27] mastering what I'm using and also
[00:32:30] falling back on what I was using before
[00:32:33] just so I can compete in competition
[00:32:36] it's it's difficult and I feel yeah
[00:32:38] that's the same place I find myself
[00:32:41] constantly in memorization because you
[00:32:44] know I'm like okay I've got to come up
[00:32:45] with a new system I have a new system
[00:32:47] for like cards and numbers and I'm
[00:32:49] halfway in halfway out like in
[00:32:51] competitions I still use the old one but
[00:32:54] I keep doing competitions so then I
[00:32:55] don't really get time to try the new one
[00:32:59] but I don't want to do the new one
[00:33:01] competition because I'll get a slower
[00:33:02] score you know if I gotta like stop and
[00:33:04] not compete and just do some serious
[00:33:07] practice and then show up when I'm ready
[00:33:09] you know I feel your pain yeah
[00:33:12] so what are some of your records I'd
[00:33:14] love to know so like what's your best
[00:33:16] car I don't know what to aim for like
[00:33:18] ice what's your fastest time your
[00:33:21] average time like for you and by three
[00:33:23] so for a three by three which is
[00:33:26] definitely my favorite events um and my
[00:33:31] fastest single time is six point four
[00:33:33] seconds and my fastest average time is
[00:33:37] seven point nine okay life so the idea
[00:33:41] behind what I'm learning right now is
[00:33:44] that I could if I really wanted to beat
[00:33:49] my best single time I could stick to the
[00:33:52] previous system I was using and just
[00:33:54] keep drilling it and competing until I
[00:33:57] got really lucky in competition and
[00:33:59] skipped a step and got a [ __ ] yeah which
[00:34:02] which would be great but I'm more
[00:34:04] concerned with my average time okay and
[00:34:07] when I got my seven point nine average
[00:34:11] when was this it was not a year and a
[00:34:13] half ago now so I haven't beat it in a
[00:34:15] while at the time it was really good
[00:34:18] like top ten in the world it was a much
[00:34:19] faster average than I usually got in
[00:34:24] competition at the time but learning
[00:34:27] this new system has brought my when I do
[00:34:32] well with zeebee yeah I get a lot of
[00:34:35] sixes and sevens
[00:34:37] nice okay it's just bad keys as I get
[00:34:39] nines and tens so I guess where I'm
[00:34:47] going with this right now my goal is to
[00:34:51] have this system more or less mastered
[00:34:53] within the next two years
[00:34:56] okay and once I have it mastered I'm
[00:34:59] extremely confident I can get mid seven
[00:35:03] averages no problem but it's a matter of
[00:35:06] getting to that point and when I mean
[00:35:09] what wouldn't you system are you working
[00:35:11] on with with memorization is it like
[00:35:13] memorizing three things together in one
[00:35:16] image instead of to do or kind of I mean
[00:35:19] the top card memorizer right now is Alex
[00:35:22] Mullen is an American guy he was out
[00:35:25] there filming yeah yeah yeah and he so
[00:35:29] he's getting his decks of cards in like
[00:35:31] 16 seconds which is insane no one's even
[00:35:34] close to that I mean the next guy is
[00:35:36] Simon was a German he's getting 20
[00:35:39] seconds but um the thing he's doing is
[00:35:42] is people have done this for maybe 10
[00:35:45] years now his pairs of cards being one
[00:35:47] thing which then itself is a big task to
[00:35:51] learn it's 2,700 images you got to know
[00:35:54] every possible combination of cards and
[00:35:57] he does something slightly different but
[00:36:00] you know I was I'm like I've been trying
[00:36:03] to do that for a while and I set up
[00:36:04] something where I kind of had all those
[00:36:06] images but I didn't learn them and then
[00:36:09] I saw how he was doing it I'm like well
[00:36:11] maybe I should do that but it's kind of
[00:36:13] far away from what I've been doing for
[00:36:15] seven years so I'm trying to find a way
[00:36:19] I think I found it where I can kind of
[00:36:21] keep doing the system that I do just
[00:36:24] amplify it to this to card pair thing
[00:36:27] but it's tough because I see him but I'm
[00:36:30] like well he's the fastest in the world
[00:36:31] maybe I should just do what he's doing
[00:36:33] lost you there I don't know if you can
[00:36:35] hear me yeah I can hear you can you hear
[00:36:37] me oh okay you're back okay yeah now I'm
[00:36:41] saying so Alex is doing it one way and
[00:36:43] you're like well maybe I should just do
[00:36:45] it that way because it's proven to work
[00:36:46] but then I'm like well I'm so good at my
[00:36:49] way maybe I should just make a version
[00:36:51] of mine that similar to his but kind of
[00:36:53] my own it's it's it's complicated
[00:36:55] especially when you've been doing
[00:36:56] something for so long the same way and
[00:36:58] it's fast enough right like yeah what am
[00:37:01] I really trying to do like shave 5
[00:37:03] seconds off I mean who cares except for
[00:37:05] me exact but it's important and so I'm
[00:37:08] still working on it what's the so you're
[00:37:13] saying the average good average would be
[00:37:14] like seven and a half in mid-sentence
[00:37:17] what is that world record average yeah
[00:37:19] world record average is six and a half
[00:37:21] okay Wow
[00:37:23] all right so we're talking you're right
[00:37:25] yeah this guy's seems deal
[00:37:27] he's kind of the Alex of the cube world
[00:37:30] he and the Cystic he uses isn't isn't ZB
[00:37:35] although he so there are lots of
[00:37:39] different variants of these speed
[00:37:41] solving techniques and what Felix does
[00:37:44] is instead of mastering a system
[00:37:46] completely he learns the best stuff from
[00:37:50] each variation and then depending on
[00:37:52] what he gets in the sole he uses that
[00:37:55] which is great I mean that's really good
[00:37:58] and I view that too to a certain extent
[00:38:00] but for some reason I just really want
[00:38:05] to master this dis employee I think
[00:38:08] there's something kind of beautiful
[00:38:11] almost about doing this really advanced
[00:38:14] system and being able to use it every
[00:38:16] time it's it's just it's more funny for
[00:38:19] me
[00:38:19] so yeah that's part of it right it's
[00:38:21] like yeah you want to get the end result
[00:38:23] which is faster times but it's also kind
[00:38:25] of mastering it in your own way that
[00:38:27] you're proud of and it's kind of like
[00:38:30] you kind of help figure it out so that's
[00:38:32] kind of special if you can master
[00:38:33] everybody's going to want to do your
[00:38:34] your created system you know yeah
[00:38:38] exactly and you know I've been I've been
[00:38:41] so concerned about the speed of my
[00:38:43] solves for its coming up on nine years
[00:38:46] now that I've been solving Rubik's cubes
[00:38:48] and I think when you focus on the end
[00:38:52] result getting faster times improving
[00:38:55] your world ranking it puts pressure on
[00:38:57] you in competition and I know there have
[00:38:59] been many times where I could have got
[00:39:01] faster times in competition but I put a
[00:39:04] lot of pressure on myself to try and
[00:39:06] maintain that ranking and it's stressful
[00:39:10] it's hard and after doing this for nine
[00:39:13] years and constantly trying to like you
[00:39:16] know maintain a like top 20 in the world
[00:39:18] ranking it's it's difficult so I'm
[00:39:22] finding a lot more enjoyment how to
[00:39:25] mastering this system rather than
[00:39:27] focusing on my times right now got it
[00:39:30] and so what's next for you what are you
[00:39:33] trying to do you do this for a full time
[00:39:35] this is your profession well I'm small
[00:39:39] so all of this travel and everything
[00:39:42] that I've been doing it's it's every
[00:39:44] weekend for me I've I've been living
[00:39:47] that tuesday/thursday class schedule
[00:39:49] life for a couple of years now okay what
[00:39:52] do you study
[00:39:53] sorry what are you studying business I'm
[00:39:57] doing a like a econ Business
[00:40:00] Administration double major and right
[00:40:03] now what I have going on
[00:40:06] so I'm mastering this system and trying
[00:40:09] to set back from competitions for a
[00:40:11] little while yeah and in the process
[00:40:14] I'll be focusing on school and I do I do
[00:40:18] shows with the cube that are kind of
[00:40:21] twofold
[00:40:22] they're either educational or of the
[00:40:25] entertainment variety um and I have I
[00:40:29] have some different shows and talks like
[00:40:31] put together over the years but I guess
[00:40:34] this next year I'm trying to refine
[00:40:36] these further start pushing that a bit
[00:40:39] more because I've been I've been getting
[00:40:42] gigs when I can but when I'm competing
[00:40:46] every other weekend I don't have a lot
[00:40:48] of time to do that so this next year I'm
[00:40:51] gonna try and put myself in good
[00:40:53] position to to make this a full-time
[00:40:55] thing once I graduate very cool
[00:40:58] yeah it's a cool thing and people are
[00:41:00] fascinated by the the cube world I think
[00:41:02] you're there good space how can people
[00:41:05] learn more about you you have a website
[00:41:06] yeah Brookes cubing calm excuse me calm
[00:41:10] and then follow you what's your handles
[00:41:13] and stuff yeah first cubing for
[00:41:15] everything but I mostly post on
[00:41:17] Instagram so that's the best bet I'll
[00:41:20] put that information below one last
[00:41:23] thing I got to ask you because I think
[00:41:24] it's the coolest friggin picture
[00:41:26] probably you think the same and you
[00:41:28] rotate it in your your cover or your
[00:41:31] picture but I don't remember the rapper
[00:41:33] but you're on stage and it's like in
[00:41:36] front of an audience and some rappers
[00:41:37] just like out of his mind and you're
[00:41:39] just like tossing the Rubik's Cube away
[00:41:41] like you just saw that what was that
[00:41:43] yeah so there's this rapper called logic
[00:41:48] he's getting he's getting really big
[00:41:50] right now a lot of people haven't heard
[00:41:52] him but I like his music if you like rap
[00:41:54] he's very lyrics oriented which I'm into
[00:41:58] so I I have heard his music a few years
[00:42:01] ago and in 2014 20 2015 I met him at a
[00:42:08] big music festival in New York and we
[00:42:11] hit it off because of the whole cube
[00:42:13] connection he he's always posting on
[00:42:15] social media about Rubik's Cube sees
[00:42:17] he's a cube or a cell phone I was gonna
[00:42:20] screw this all together so that was kind
[00:42:22] of the connection and then I'll give you
[00:42:26] like a two-minute version of the story
[00:42:28] but I went to one of his concerts in
[00:42:32] Dallas last year and I thought about
[00:42:35] reaching out before the concert but I
[00:42:38] had a lot going on I actually had a
[00:42:39] ludic skewed competition that same day
[00:42:42] so I just showed up to the concert he
[00:42:45] didn't know I'd be there but song at the
[00:42:47] concert he sees me in the crowd and that
[00:42:51] was pretty cool in it of itself because
[00:42:53] he kind of like he did a double-take
[00:42:55] and my brother was with me he's like
[00:42:57] dude he just he just noticed you I was
[00:42:58] like yeah that's cool then like mid song
[00:43:01] he's like pointing at me and people
[00:43:03] around me in the crowd are like who's
[00:43:05] this guy so he walks around he's like
[00:43:09] smiling and looking at me Travis all
[00:43:11] finishes the song and he like yells the
[00:43:14] stagehands to turn on the lights and
[00:43:16] he's like Anthony is that Anthony
[00:43:19] [ __ ] Brooks and we started
[00:43:24] having a conversation like in the middle
[00:43:26] of the concert and I had a Rubik's Cube
[00:43:29] with me so he's like toss the cube up
[00:43:30] here so I toss it up on stage he's
[00:43:33] mixing it up and during his concert
[00:43:37] sometimes he'll do a little cube demo or
[00:43:39] where again that's like there's a
[00:43:41] background of the Rubik's Cube and he'll
[00:43:42] solve it and music we plan well instead
[00:43:45] of doing it himself that time he tells
[00:43:48] us like six foot nine security detail to
[00:43:51] like lift me up onto the stage so I
[00:43:53] pushed it up
[00:43:54] on the stage and yeah I did the whole
[00:43:57] thing he mix it up for me and there's a
[00:44:01] big countdown she asked me he challenged
[00:44:05] me to solve it in less than 15 seconds
[00:44:07] and I did it in like seven seconds of
[00:44:09] course actually when I talked about like
[00:44:12] skipping a step in competition to get a
[00:44:14] really fast time I don't know what it is
[00:44:17] I guess I'm lucky but for whatever
[00:44:19] reason whenever I'm like in a really big
[00:44:23] moment like cows on Good Morning America
[00:44:25] when I was on good day New York when I
[00:44:27] was up on stage with logic I just keep
[00:44:31] skipping that last now you get
[00:44:33] thankfully past time so I sold it like I
[00:44:38] don't know I just it was like a really
[00:44:40] hyped up moment you know I'm like dance
[00:44:42] around on stage toss the cube up in the
[00:44:45] air it was really cool experience that's
[00:44:49] awesome yeah it's an epic photo they're
[00:44:51] all like reactions at the setting it's
[00:44:53] like you can make for a better one for
[00:44:55] like your brand you know let's all stay
[00:44:57] cool story
[00:44:59] nice well good luck tomorrow thanks so
[00:45:02] much for taking the time I'd love to
[00:45:05] privately we can talk more about
[00:45:07] strategies and maybe we can talk about
[00:45:09] memory a little more but I hope to see
[00:45:12] you somewhere you cross paths somewhere
[00:45:14] we're on very different planes but
[00:45:16] somehow they can be kind of collide
[00:45:19] somewhere you know yeah but yeah good
[00:45:22] luck tomorrow man thanks for your time
[00:45:23] well I'll share your phone below and
[00:45:26] I'll let you know what the videos up
[00:45:29] awesome same time go man take it easy
[00:45:33] you

=== HOW TO // "Memorizing 28 names in less than 60 seconds! " ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpC0cWLjU8c

[00:00:01] hey guys how you doing Happy New Year as
[00:00:03] promised last week I said I would go
[00:00:06] back over that name memorizing attempt I
[00:00:08] did where I did 28 names in under 60
[00:00:11] seconds and I would explain in slow
[00:00:13] motion how I did that and what was going
[00:00:16] on in my head so the quick of it is and
[00:00:19] I've I've said this in many different
[00:00:21] interviews blog posts whatever how to
[00:00:23] memorize names is choose a feature some
[00:00:26] feature on the person's face and come up
[00:00:28] with a picture for the name and then
[00:00:30] put the two together imagine the picture
[00:00:32] interacting with that
[00:00:34] feature nothing more to it than that
[00:00:36] other than practice and um as you'll see
[00:00:40] getting 28 names in 60 seconds isn't
[00:00:42] easy um but uh the more you do it the
[00:00:46] faster you become at creating pictures
[00:00:48] and associating it to or linking it to
[00:00:51] that feature um so I think the best way
[00:00:54] uh to understand this process is to get
[00:00:57] inside my head and see what I'm actually
[00:00:59] saying myself so I'm going to show the
[00:01:01] same video uh that I recorded last week
[00:01:05] uh slow it down a little bit and pause
[00:01:08] it here and there just so I can explain
[00:01:10] what was happening in my head um and
[00:01:13] that moment to memorize that person's
[00:01:15] name now I was going obviously a lot
[00:01:18] faster so some of the stuff that I
[00:01:21] actually will say in this video was
[00:01:23] happening very quickly and at probably
[00:01:25] um a very less specific in less detail
[00:01:29] um
[00:01:30] and that's where the practice comes in
[00:01:32] is after a while um to get fast at names
[00:01:35] you don't need to say as much as I'm
[00:01:37] going to be saying when I explain it um
[00:01:39] it will just be very quick in my head
[00:01:40] and maybe I'll mention a few of what
[00:01:43] literally would happen in my head um in
[00:01:46] the shorthand even though you may not
[00:01:48] understand another thing is um some of
[00:01:51] these images may not make sense to you
[00:01:53] why I'm coming up with them but that's
[00:01:54] that's me and that's the nature of
[00:01:56] Association we all have our own thoughts
[00:01:58] we have all have our own education and
[00:02:00] experiences so my images are based on
[00:02:03] the collection of things that I have in
[00:02:04] my head that I pull from you may have a
[00:02:06] completely different set of uh
[00:02:08] experiences to pull from so while
[00:02:10] something may be so obvious to me to you
[00:02:13] may seem obvious that it's something
[00:02:15] else so this is just an example you're
[00:02:17] free to do your own things mine aren't
[00:02:19] the answer okay but it might help you
[00:02:21] kind of understand what's going on so
[00:02:24] let's uh pull back this video from last
[00:02:27] week let me rewind and I'll start with
[00:02:30] this one right the timer's at 59 just
[00:02:32] dropped from 60 seconds it's counting
[00:02:34] down and I'm faced with this first
[00:02:36] person Cindy so her um drawn to her
[00:02:39] smile very um bright and happy it's a
[00:02:43] bit uneven her teeth but still a
[00:02:45] beautiful smile but what the point is
[00:02:46] I'm focusing on her teeth um Cindy
[00:02:49] reminds me of a cinder block um so I
[00:02:52] would quickly imagine smashing a cinder
[00:02:54] block against her Perfect Smile there
[00:02:58] destroying her whole teeth and smile
[00:03:01] nice right all right next comes up
[00:03:04] Stephanie so I think of stepping on
[00:03:07] something um she's kind of got this
[00:03:08] highlight across her hair so I would
[00:03:10] imagine some foot stepping on
[00:03:14] that what's next um okay we have
[00:03:18] Lawrence so I pictur his glasses as his
[00:03:21] feature um Lawrence reminds me of a law
[00:03:24] um document so I picked some long scroll
[00:03:27] with all this law jargon on it and
[00:03:29] that's kind of like stuck his glasses
[00:03:31] dangling down simple as
[00:03:33] that all right Stefania so uh we already
[00:03:37] had Stephanie right which is going to be
[00:03:39] the same except for that last letter
[00:03:42] thank goodness Stefania reminds me of a
[00:03:45] basketball player Vladimir stepa he was
[00:03:48] tall and Russian and played for the
[00:03:51] Miami Heat um and so I'm going to
[00:03:53] picture this big um ogre looking guy um
[00:03:57] also stepping on um this
[00:04:00] I'm going to imagine the space between
[00:04:01] her eyebrows for whatever reason that's
[00:04:02] what I'm drawn to he's stepping on her
[00:04:05] specifically him uh which will help me
[00:04:07] remember that not only is it step step
[00:04:10] something it's stea it's gonna end in
[00:04:12] the I
[00:04:14] a all right what's next uh let's go this
[00:04:18] slowed down um okay here we go Glenn so
[00:04:21] I'm going to think of he's kind of got
[00:04:22] like oldish skin on his left cheek maybe
[00:04:25] a few wrinkles um I'm going to picture
[00:04:27] gleaming a light onto him his uh his
[00:04:30] cheek there Glenn gleam close enough
[00:04:34] okay what else Ethel so I think of like
[00:04:37] Ethel alcohol is is that something
[00:04:40] anyways I think of it um like in a
[00:04:42] little squirt bottle and I'm squirting
[00:04:43] it on that hair that goes across her
[00:04:46] face
[00:04:47] there okay Dave um I have a friend named
[00:04:51] Dave I climbed with him he's from like
[00:04:53] The Boondocks Montana or Wyoming and uh
[00:04:56] he always talks about moose so I picture
[00:04:58] Dave uh whenever I see the name Dave I
[00:05:01] think of a moose and I'm gonna imagine a
[00:05:03] Moose's antlers kind of rustling into
[00:05:06] his mustache
[00:05:08] there okay Ron this is perfect I think
[00:05:12] of Ron White another memory guy um and
[00:05:15] uh see this guy's got a white beard so
[00:05:17] this one's actually pretty simple Ron
[00:05:19] White white
[00:05:22] beard Carl I think of a car um this guy
[00:05:26] kind of has a very small head
[00:05:28] comparatively to his body so I'm to
[00:05:29] picture a car going around his head the
[00:05:32] head shape that he
[00:05:36] has all right who's next Roy uh Roy is a
[00:05:39] friend of mine uh from high uh from
[00:05:42] college he always wears a fedora hat or
[00:05:44] he used to um so I'm going to picture a
[00:05:46] fedora hat covering this guy's goatee
[00:05:48] the goatee is what I noticed so Fedora
[00:05:51] Roy um
[00:05:54] goatee all right Donald I think of
[00:05:56] Donald Duck um I noticed this guy's
[00:05:59] little little cut there in his hair I'm
[00:06:01] going to picture Donald Duck um kind of
[00:06:03] nibbling with his beak at that part of
[00:06:05] his
[00:06:07] hair Johnny it's weird that a woman has
[00:06:09] this name but could happen um Johnny
[00:06:12] reminds me of a dart I had a best friend
[00:06:15] uh my old job in Boston um we used to
[00:06:18] play darts together so whenever see
[00:06:19] Johnny I think of a dart This Woman's
[00:06:21] hair do is what attracts me to her uh
[00:06:24] it's kind of funky and curly so I'm
[00:06:25] going imagine a throwing a dart into her
[00:06:28] hair
[00:06:31] moving along Shan uh I think of a
[00:06:35] football player for my high school Shawn
[00:06:36] Taylor we played basketball varsity
[00:06:38] basketball together and I have this one
[00:06:40] memory of him and this is just to show
[00:06:42] you how associative my memory can be and
[00:06:44] how yours could be if you want it to be
[00:06:46] um so I think Sha Sha Taylor I think of
[00:06:48] this one memory where he came out of the
[00:06:49] locker room after practice in flipflops
[00:06:52] and pass him the ball cuz he wanted to
[00:06:55] shoot and he did a twoand slam dunk
[00:06:58] right there flat footed um from his
[00:07:01] flip-flops this guy had hops like you
[00:07:03] wouldn't believe he could jump out of
[00:07:04] the roof um so Sean I think a flip-flop
[00:07:07] always um and this guy kind of has this
[00:07:10] Abraham Ginger beard um so I'm gonna
[00:07:13] imagine kind of slapping a flip-flop
[00:07:16] onto that
[00:07:18] beard all right next Dana I shortened
[00:07:21] that to Dan Dan and Dana are pretty much
[00:07:23] the same obviously this is a woman so it
[00:07:25] wouldn't be Dan it would be Dana um Dan
[00:07:27] I think of karate there's different
[00:07:29] levels of of expertise Dan is that right
[00:07:33] I they call Dan I don't know that's just
[00:07:35] what I think of so I'm going to picture
[00:07:36] chopping karate chopping kind of that
[00:07:39] crease there where her head curls and uh
[00:07:41] curves her hair curves and she has that
[00:07:43] hoop
[00:07:45] earring what next um David I have a best
[00:07:49] friend named David David um this is
[00:07:51] different than Dave okay obviously those
[00:07:53] are nicknames for each other but someone
[00:07:54] might be called Dave over David and
[00:07:56] David over Dave right um so David
[00:07:59] reminds me of my friend David he's
[00:08:00] Jewish um I think of a dral um so I'm
[00:08:04] going to focus on this guy's kind of
[00:08:06] broad bottom part of his nose there's a
[00:08:08] drel spinning on that part of his
[00:08:12] nose okay next um there's another memory
[00:08:15] guy named Boris Conrad um he's very
[00:08:18] smart intellectual um I could very
[00:08:22] easily imagine him this guy this kid uh
[00:08:25] being Boris as a younger kid this is
[00:08:27] just a photograph of him younger that
[00:08:29] one was
[00:08:31] easy okay Jimmy I think of um I don't
[00:08:36] know even know if this is right but when
[00:08:37] you open a car uh that you've locked
[00:08:39] your car keys in right you put the thing
[00:08:41] through the window isn't that a Jimmy um
[00:08:44] anyways that's what I think of so like
[00:08:45] kind of like a coat hanger um unfolded
[00:08:48] um and I notice his hair at the top is
[00:08:50] very straight and kind of fine so I'm
[00:08:52] going to picture kind of putting a coat
[00:08:53] hack coat coat rack hanger um into his
[00:08:58] hair there
[00:09:01] Samuel for Sams and Samuels I think of
[00:09:04] Sandwich like a sub sandwich um
[00:09:07] obviously Sam and Samuel are the same
[00:09:09] kind of like Dave and David but um
[00:09:11] Samuel since it's longer I'll think of
[00:09:12] like a a foot long sandwich and uh Sam
[00:09:16] shortened I'll just picture like a six
[00:09:19] inch U sandwich so anyways he's got a
[00:09:22] creepy little um mustache there that's
[00:09:24] trying to show so a picture putting a
[00:09:26] sandwich a foot long sandwich right on
[00:09:28] his upper leg
[00:09:31] Roberta so for Robert or Roberta I think
[00:09:34] of my friend Robert who is a DJ so he's
[00:09:37] doing this DJ movement um and I noticed
[00:09:39] this woman has a mole right here or some
[00:09:42] kind of blemish um so I'm picturing a DJ
[00:09:45] kind of rubbing it um like it's
[00:09:47] music obviously she's a female so I
[00:09:50] would remember that Robert DJ it's
[00:09:52] actually Roberta not
[00:09:54] Robert okay Roger this guy's got an even
[00:09:56] longer mustache um Roger makes me think
[00:09:58] of like saluting someone saying Roger
[00:10:01] that um and so I'm kind of like saluting
[00:10:03] his his awesome mustache saying Roger
[00:10:06] that bro that's a nice
[00:10:08] mustache all right we're about halfway
[00:10:10] through Albert I think of a CrossFit
[00:10:12] friend of mine who's always lifting
[00:10:14] weights so this guy is lifting a barbell
[00:10:16] and crushing it onto his glasses glass
[00:10:18] goes
[00:10:20] everywhere Mary so I Mary I think of
[00:10:23] like marrying someone um this girl woman
[00:10:27] I wouldn't particularly want to marry
[00:10:29] out my cup of tea um probably a very
[00:10:31] nice girl but not attracted to her so I
[00:10:34] can imagine myself being forced to marry
[00:10:36] this woman and being very unhappy about
[00:10:39] it Charlene so um for people with the
[00:10:43] lean Eileen Darlene Marlene Charlene I
[00:10:47] typically think of them leaning and her
[00:10:49] head is kind of leaning a bit to the
[00:10:50] side so that's perfect the Char you know
[00:10:53] I've seen it I've read it so in part
[00:10:56] I've I've probably somewhat memorized it
[00:10:58] um so I'm going to just go ahead and say
[00:11:00] okay lean it's one of those names with
[00:11:03] lean JN I think of going to the JN
[00:11:06] taking a dump um this guy's got kind of
[00:11:09] like a big lower lip that kind of juts
[00:11:12] out a bit so I can imagine taking a poop
[00:11:14] as if that's a toilet
[00:11:15] bowl yeah okay Harry um Harry reminds me
[00:11:19] of Harry um his nose is kind of Broad
[00:11:22] and flat and his nostrils are kind of a
[00:11:24] bit narrow together so I would imagine
[00:11:27] focusing their hair just coming out of
[00:11:29] there very hairy even though it's not
[00:11:31] right Gerard I think of a soccer player
[00:11:34] um a British soccer player and I'm going
[00:11:36] to cheat here because his colors of his
[00:11:38] suit and his tie are what pop out at me
[00:11:41] I'm going to imagine a soccer player
[00:11:43] kicking a soccer ball right at that knot
[00:11:46] of his
[00:11:49] tie okay Bonnie is a friend of mine from
[00:11:52] college she used to be afraid of or
[00:11:54] probably still is afraid of mice um we
[00:11:56] had an incident once I remember it very
[00:11:58] well so I'm going a picture and her
[00:12:00] lines on her mouth there's a mouse just
[00:12:02] kind of scurrying about right there so
[00:12:04] Bonnie and
[00:12:07] mouse okay we're getting at the end here
[00:12:10] um typically what I do with the last
[00:12:11] three names is I'll just like pick them
[00:12:13] up in my head and say Marlene the next
[00:12:15] one's Charles Eduardo and just repeat
[00:12:17] them in my head just to get a few
[00:12:18] seconds um off the clock here but if I
[00:12:21] were to going memorize this um you'll
[00:12:23] notice that this is also a name with
[00:12:25] lean we have Charlene and now Marlene so
[00:12:27] if I came to this name after Charlene
[00:12:29] where I didn't really specify anything
[00:12:31] for sh I'd be like oh shoot um there's
[00:12:34] going to be two leans I hope I don't
[00:12:35] confuse them afterwards um in this case
[00:12:38] since I'm trying to go for Speed I'm
[00:12:40] gonna focus on that leaning again at
[00:12:42] luck of the draw her head is a bit
[00:12:44] tilted I can imagine her leaning as well
[00:12:47] um I just hope I remember that Mar um
[00:12:50] Mar lean um is going to stick with me I
[00:12:53] might make a quick note that Mar maybe
[00:12:56] this woman is old enough to be my mom so
[00:12:58] I can remember that at least there's a m
[00:13:00] sound in
[00:13:02] there okay the last two names here
[00:13:04] Charles Charles is my middle name um
[00:13:07] whenever I picture myself I picture
[00:13:08] myself with a Rubik's Cube because I
[00:13:09] used to do that a lot um he kind of has
[00:13:11] this divot in between his eyebrows so
[00:13:13] I'm going to picture a Rubik's cube
[00:13:15] right there
[00:13:16] Charles and then finally Eduardo I think
[00:13:18] of Eduardo Savin who uh co-founded
[00:13:21] Facebook he went to our high school and
[00:13:23] I always remember this forgive me U he's
[00:13:26] probably had it removed anyways he had a
[00:13:28] big mole on his neck um so I would
[00:13:30] picture so whenever I see Eduardo the
[00:13:32] name Eduardo I think of a big mole um
[00:13:34] and I'm G to focus on this guy's
[00:13:35] dreadlocks in front of his eyes um
[00:13:37] imagining maybe he's covering this huge
[00:13:40] mole on his forehead boom and that's it
[00:13:43] right U I have 10 seconds left um just
[00:13:48] because um this software makes you wait
[00:13:50] 60 seconds before you can start to
[00:13:51] recall so in my head I'm kind of going
[00:13:54] over some of those names let's speed
[00:13:56] this up a little bit okay here we go so
[00:13:59] we have all the the faces here I just
[00:14:00] got to write in all the names so let's
[00:14:03] see I I run to the first one I guess
[00:14:05] that I remembered is the last guy is
[00:14:07] Eduardo write that down the mole right
[00:14:11] where do I go to next let's see oh yeah
[00:14:13] she was one of the last ones I write uh
[00:14:16] that's Marlene and then uh I put Charles
[00:14:21] which was also one of the last ones I
[00:14:22] remember I just write it down there so I
[00:14:24] can actually go back and he'll be the
[00:14:26] odd man out I can just fill in his name
[00:14:28] right well that's Charles actually so um
[00:14:32] then I go here I remember the coat
[00:14:34] hanger in his hair
[00:14:36] Jimmy um the car going around
[00:14:39] Carl marrying that girl this guy Donald
[00:14:43] Duck Right nibbling at that part in his
[00:14:46] hair that guy soccer ball and his tie
[00:14:49] Gerard but I think I forgot him this
[00:14:52] yeah uh the alcohol ethyl alcohol going
[00:14:55] on her hair so
[00:14:56] Ethel I raise Charles cuz I probably
[00:14:59] wrote it down um this guy's rogering I
[00:15:02] Roger his mustache right there it is
[00:15:05] Cindy that was the first one I memorized
[00:15:07] the cinder block to her teeth um this
[00:15:10] was a Leen right one of the Leaning
[00:15:13] people so Charlene just remember that
[00:15:17] right okay ah this was uh stepping on in
[00:15:20] between her eyebrows but it was that
[00:15:22] Vladimir sta so that's
[00:15:24] Stefania yep okay the next guy um is Ron
[00:15:29] is white beard Ron White so Ron uh this
[00:15:33] was one of the first guys Dave right the
[00:15:35] moose that was reminded of ruffling in
[00:15:38] his
[00:15:40] mustache um what was she oh yeah her her
[00:15:43] hair coloring uh was stepping on it so
[00:15:47] Stephanie not Stefania but Stephanie
[00:15:50] right then the next one yep Dana
[00:15:52] remember the karate
[00:15:53] chop um Harry nose or
[00:15:57] Harry uh Sean right with the flip-flops
[00:16:00] on his
[00:16:01] beard JN taking a poop in the John and
[00:16:05] his lower lip um Roberta DJing her Mo my
[00:16:09] friend
[00:16:10] Robert uh Roy with the Fedora okay my
[00:16:13] friend who always wore a hat name was
[00:16:16] Roy um this is Bonnie right the mouse
[00:16:19] that was reminded of Bonnie going on to
[00:16:22] face and then Lawrence so the law
[00:16:25] document hanging from his glasses my
[00:16:26] friend Albert crushed with a dark bar
[00:16:29] barbell on his glasses my friend David
[00:16:32] he's got the drle on his tip of his nose
[00:16:35] this guy's got a sandwich Samuel on his
[00:16:38] upper lip my friend Boris uh Glenn I'm
[00:16:42] gleaming a light on his face there I
[00:16:45] think I don't remember this guy in this
[00:16:47] attempt it's one of the ones I forgot uh
[00:16:49] Johnny throwing the dart in her haird
[00:16:53] right and I think that's it I struggle
[00:16:55] with those two guys right yeah okay so
[00:16:59] that's pretty much it um you'll notice
[00:17:02] that for a lot of my I choose the same
[00:17:05] feature um the same uh similar names I
[00:17:09] have similar images and that's really
[00:17:11] key because a lot of people ask me like
[00:17:12] do I always have to come up with a
[00:17:13] different image for everything and it's
[00:17:15] like no I actually use a lot of the same
[00:17:17] ones I repeat them over and over um it's
[00:17:20] just you know each person is unique um
[00:17:22] so like if I had a few people that had a
[00:17:24] beard like three guys in a row beard
[00:17:27] beard beard and uh one is Rob Robert or
[00:17:32] and Robbie right that's tricky right
[00:17:34] which one's Rob if I'm going to use the
[00:17:36] same image um and the same feature but
[00:17:39] for actual um actually Rob I think of
[00:17:44] someone robbing something uh Robert was
[00:17:47] the DJ right and Robbie I think of like
[00:17:50] whatever comes to mind so Joe Robbie
[00:17:52] Stadium is where the Dolphins used to
[00:17:54] play so I picture maybe a stadium um and
[00:17:57] then for each of them I'd imagine you
[00:17:58] know robbing this guy's beard dejing
[00:18:01] this guy's beard placing a stadium on
[00:18:03] this guy's beard um and I know that
[00:18:06] sounds repetitive and maybe confusing if
[00:18:08] you try to during recall would I forget
[00:18:10] that because they all have beards but
[00:18:13] everybody's different so of course they
[00:18:14] all have the beard and that's what I'm
[00:18:15] focusing on but of course I see the
[00:18:17] person's face it might be someone who's
[00:18:19] fat who's skinny who's got a long face
[00:18:21] skinny face um old young whatever
[00:18:24] there's different things that we're
[00:18:25] processing really quickly that we're
[00:18:27] aren't aware of so you know Rob may be a
[00:18:29] young kid um Robbie may be um overweight
[00:18:34] and Robert might be African American
[00:18:37] whatever um so I'm noticing these while
[00:18:40] I notice the beard so those together
[00:18:42] make it a unique experience um in that
[00:18:45] part you have to trust your memory that
[00:18:46] you'll remember and maybe sometimes you
[00:18:48] forget but what are you going to do with
[00:18:49] three robs you know robs in a row
[00:18:53] so um and then you notice for the names
[00:18:57] um a lot of them I have preset images
[00:19:00] those just come with practice you can go
[00:19:02] out and find the hundred most common
[00:19:04] male names or female names and try to
[00:19:07] write down images that you just want to
[00:19:09] have on hand but I don't do that I don't
[00:19:12] think it's important um as long as you
[00:19:15] practice you'll kind of go with what
[00:19:17] makes sense to you and M change I mean
[00:19:19] if I just met um you know Stephen um I
[00:19:23] might throw away the old image and just
[00:19:25] go with the guy I just met Stephen
[00:19:27] that's going to be my image just because
[00:19:28] it's fresh fresh and it's new um I think
[00:19:30] it's always best to leave room for some
[00:19:33] uh improvisation based on what you're
[00:19:35] into maybe you saw a movie and now this
[00:19:37] new name that before might have been
[00:19:39] hard to come up with a picture for gives
[00:19:41] you something really quick and easy to
[00:19:43] go to so I hope that helps um you can
[00:19:47] practice this as well if you go to
[00:19:48] memory league.com um this software is
[00:19:51] available there um and I co-created it
[00:19:54] so um it's fun you can challenge other
[00:19:57] people and just train your mind get
[00:19:58] better names amongst other things so
[00:20:00] check it out um it's a new year try to
[00:20:03] remember people you meet um it's one of
[00:20:05] the coolest things you can do uh to

[00:02:10] from what do you do okay
[00:02:13] from from Manchester in the UK
[00:02:15] originally but it's Israelis and yeah I
[00:02:18] got started in memory sports around
[00:02:20] about 2008 although I found out about
[00:02:24] memory techniques when I was maybe 10 or
[00:02:26] 11 at school and was until I went to uni
[00:02:29] that I found out about memory
[00:02:31] competitions so my first one was there
[00:02:34] it was friendly it was called the
[00:02:37] Cambridge memory championship back in
[00:02:39] 2008 and yeah I've got two kids so I've
[00:02:42] had a couple of sort of Long's breaks
[00:02:44] from memory sport but there's last
[00:02:47] year's xmt that I sort of came back into
[00:02:49] it and yeah it's all going around this

[00:03:46] practice a little bit like the ex-ante I
[00:03:49] practice and I tried to practice a bit
[00:03:51] of Dutch with vessel and you know I was
[00:03:54] practicing Spanish the other day with
[00:03:55] Xavier you know
[00:03:58] I love speaking and all sorts of
[00:04:01] different languages I had lots of time
[00:04:03] and so how did I mean you said you love
[00:04:06] languages but did that when you first
[00:04:07] started studying them whenever that was
[00:04:10] was that just out of interest or did you
[00:04:12] have are your parents from a Dutch
[00:04:16] background German background anything or
[00:04:18] was just your own it
[00:04:19] my dad used to actually translate touch
[00:04:22] as well as those dance and
[00:04:24] that came from school we just in French
[00:04:26] and German um but I actually went to uni
[00:04:29] to do computer science instead so I
[00:04:31] started out as a programmer and
[00:04:33] basically because I loved languages so
[00:04:36] much after a few years I just write I'm
[00:04:38] just I'm just gonna get this up and
[00:04:40] start out on my own and become a
[00:04:42] freelance translator so that's what I
[00:04:44] did
[00:04:44] interesting so I mean I'm focusing on
[00:04:46] the language part obviously because one
[00:04:48] of your top things is words one of the
[00:04:51] memory events the best at it but so
[00:04:55] would you say I mean your passion for
[00:04:58] languages I mean you're you're probably
[00:05:00] very good at it just me knowing you but
[00:05:04] do you think that comes from I guess the
[00:05:06] quick question is a natural gift or is
[00:05:09] it just because you have such a passion
[00:05:10] for it that you immerse yourself so much
[00:05:13] and got rid of it because you're
[00:05:14] obsessed with it I guess it's hard to
[00:05:17] say really I guess because I mean
[00:05:18] exposed to so many different languages
[00:05:20] it does help with words because you know
[00:05:23] everywhere has so many different
[00:05:24] associations yeah I guess I guess the
[00:05:26] studying helps or maybe and maybe it's
[00:05:29] because I'm good to big words that I got
[00:05:30] interested in I would do that I don't
[00:05:32] really know and the answer to that one
[00:05:34] but yeah I just it's always been really
[00:05:36] and passionate about learning languages
[00:05:39] okay yeah so let's let's dive into that
[00:05:42] part from what I gathered over the
[00:05:45] internet this past weekend at the
[00:05:47] European Championship we just broke the
[00:05:48] world record for memorizing the most
[00:05:51] names in fifteen minutes which was 318
[00:05:54] is that right sorry that's why it's 318
[00:05:57] and names just 200 yeah names with 200
[00:06:01] both amazing records congratulations by
[00:06:05] the way
[00:06:05] those those records have been sitting
[00:06:09] there for a while especially the words
[00:06:11] one so how did it feel to break that I
[00:06:15] mean I know we had talked about it a
[00:06:16] number of weeks ago I saw you and you
[00:06:18] were kind of hoping to go for it it just
[00:06:21] did how did it feel when the the attempt
[00:06:23] was going on it actually yeah I went for
[00:06:27] 348 words I've been thinking really
[00:06:29] carefully about how many I should go for
[00:06:31] because you know that the scoring is so
[00:06:33] harsh that yeah make sure if I get any
[00:06:36] errors then I can still be in with the
[00:06:37] chance of the record and my best in
[00:06:40] training was 304 so you know to get
[00:06:44] three 1:8 was was an all-time PB for me
[00:06:47] and actually I think there were two
[00:06:49] words I swapped to the last minute and I
[00:06:51] really shouldn't have if I had done that
[00:06:54] it would have been three three so yeah
[00:06:57] it just felt really good at the time and
[00:06:59] it was a nice bonus because you know I
[00:07:01] wasn't really expecting or any question
[00:07:03] myself and it was just it was just a
[00:07:06] really nice bonus to get that and I was
[00:07:08] really happy about it yeah that's that's
[00:07:11] amazing
[00:07:12] so 318 yeah so for those who don't know
[00:07:16] though the way it's scored is there's a
[00:07:18] certain amount of words get 15 minutes
[00:07:20] and everything's in rows of 20
[00:07:22] so during recall you have to remember
[00:07:25] each row if you get a word wrong one
[00:07:29] word wrong in a row it's half so you get
[00:07:32] 10 points even though you may have 19
[00:07:34] correct in that row and then if you get
[00:07:36] more than one but Rose is 0 so you can
[00:07:40] remember a lot of words and make just
[00:07:42] this mistake here or there and that if I
[00:07:44] can cut down a lot of your points which
[00:07:46] is what you're saying could've have 330
[00:07:48] in that's insane so what's your what's
[00:07:52] your technique for those out there I'm
[00:07:55] sure they're wondering because some
[00:07:56] people who are a lot of people actually
[00:07:59] who compete in memory competitions
[00:08:01] they're really good at the numbers cards
[00:08:04] things that you can develop a system for
[00:08:06] and you know you know what you're gonna
[00:08:08] get right they get digits between 0 9
[00:08:11] for numbers and 52 cards they're always
[00:08:13] there I'll be there shuffled but with
[00:08:16] words
[00:08:17] you know there's thousands and thousands
[00:08:19] of words that could possibly show up in
[00:08:21] whatever order so how do you approach it
[00:08:23] what do you do okay so I basically put
[00:08:28] four words in each location which and is
[00:08:31] a little bit unusual because I think
[00:08:33] most people do two or maybe three and
[00:08:36] really the first time I read them is
[00:08:39] it's really just reading and if there's
[00:08:41] anything that's vigilantly visualize it
[00:08:44] in that location but I don't I don't try
[00:08:46] really hard to make images for the
[00:08:47] actual words and
[00:08:49] you know I just I just sort of read them
[00:08:51] and carry on and then when I read it
[00:08:53] again I I try to really focus on the
[00:08:56] difficult words and sort of let it
[00:08:59] change the meaning of the of the
[00:09:01] concrete words somehow so you know for
[00:09:04] example if you've got an adjective then
[00:09:05] I apply it to the thing that's in a
[00:09:08] patient wrong then make a separate image
[00:09:10] so it becomes like one big story you see
[00:09:13] what I mean yeah and something else
[00:09:15] something else that I do which I don't
[00:09:18] know of anyone else who does this I have
[00:09:21] a fixed person in each location I also
[00:09:23] do this in in numbers and cards as well
[00:09:26] and so the story never happens
[00:09:29] just don't it's always attached to a
[00:09:31] person it's always the same person and
[00:09:33] in a specific location so you know like
[00:09:37] Ben Primrose always on my driveway and
[00:09:39] you know a family member is always in
[00:09:43] the hallway and then my husband's in the
[00:09:45] dining room so yeah the story always get
[00:09:48] attached to a certain person I think
[00:09:49] that really really helps me yes okay
[00:09:52] I think I'm also in the bathroom every
[00:09:58] time so for those who don't know I mean
[00:10:01] she's mentioning location she's talking
[00:10:03] about a memory palace so you use a
[00:10:05] familiar journey through a place that
[00:10:07] you know what we're talking about here
[00:10:09] is maybe for example is her house but
[00:10:12] what she's saying she does different is
[00:10:14] she'll have each location on top of the
[00:10:16] things she's in memorizing there a
[00:10:17] person which I think it's an awesome
[00:10:20] idea just because it probably gives so
[00:10:23] much more context to the random words
[00:10:25] right you can yeah and you have the
[00:10:27] location it just makes it probably not
[00:10:29] much stronger right that's right so like
[00:10:32] if I if I say a word like impatient then
[00:10:34] it's not like I have to just come up
[00:10:36] with a random image for the word
[00:10:39] impatient I just imagined that that
[00:10:41] particular person is being a patient and
[00:10:43] that's so much easier for me to remember
[00:10:45] yeah all right so imagine let's let's
[00:10:49] just choose one of your memory palaces
[00:10:50] let's say you have one for your house
[00:10:52] I'm guessing that's great yeah yeah the
[00:10:54] entryway the front door who's there um
[00:10:56] well the driveways been and then my
[00:10:59] nephew who's name is Sammy he's in the
[00:11:01] double way okay but
[00:11:03] let's do Ben cuz we've had him on the
[00:11:04] show people nobody looks like so he's in
[00:11:06] your driveway so imagine the words that
[00:11:08] you had to list I'm gonna say four
[00:11:09] random words and just kind of talk me
[00:11:12] through what you would visualize is that
[00:11:14] cool yeah okay so it would be change mmm
[00:11:19] house football and Liberty Liberty okay
[00:11:26] so you you group them in the four
[00:11:28] together right so this is maybe a
[00:11:30] cluster you might have your in your
[00:11:32] memory palace at the driveway and you
[00:11:34] gotta come over the picture for those
[00:11:35] four okay so perhaps I probably imagine
[00:11:39] a small house so I'd imagine that Ben
[00:11:41] was switching around and various of
[00:11:45] dolls houses like really small houses
[00:11:47] and maybe he puts a football in in one
[00:11:50] house and the Statue of Liberty in the
[00:11:53] next house and he's just sort of
[00:11:54] changing around moving them around
[00:11:56] dinner on the table or something okay so
[00:11:59] in that case cuz I house a football a
[00:12:01] very concrete change is more you know
[00:12:05] it's more abstract and same with Liberty
[00:12:07] but I guess if something pops out like
[00:12:09] Statue of Liberty that that's a very
[00:12:11] concrete image you would use yeah and
[00:12:14] then yeah and then change is a very
[00:12:18] action II action kind of thing so you
[00:12:21] can apply that easily okay very cool and
[00:12:25] then yeah but then so my issue I guess
[00:12:27] would be with four words and what you
[00:12:29] just did is you know so you have then
[00:12:31] they're changing up this house that has
[00:12:35] a football in it and Statue of Liberty
[00:12:37] it's it's very visual but I feel like
[00:12:41] I'd have I make mistakes on extracting
[00:12:44] the four words from that scene
[00:12:45] afterwards you know maybe there's
[00:12:47] practice I don't know yeah I think the
[00:12:50] thing that's more common for me is to
[00:12:52] have a complete blank of the whole
[00:12:54] location once I get one word the whole
[00:12:57] four words tend to all come back so and
[00:13:01] you know one thing I do struggle with is
[00:13:03] getting words the wrong way around I
[00:13:04] mean this is what happened in my attempt
[00:13:07] on tonight was that I had these these
[00:13:10] two words the wrong way around and there
[00:13:12] were two others that I wasn't sure about
[00:13:13] so if it hasn't hadn't been for those
[00:13:15] two pairs
[00:13:16] and I've got three four eight so I
[00:13:20] really need to practice you know being
[00:13:23] really really confident of which order
[00:13:25] the items are in and but yeah having
[00:13:29] four in one location isn't really a
[00:13:30] problem for me yeah and then so you how
[00:13:34] many for this attempt you for the world
[00:13:36] record how many locations did you need
[00:13:44] or how many different journeys did you
[00:13:48] use or did you have to use its basic
[00:13:51] journey so what I do is each column of
[00:13:54] 20 words is one section of the house so
[00:13:57] it would be either an upstairs or
[00:14:00] downstairs or if it's a small house it's
[00:14:02] the whole house so I lived in quite a
[00:14:05] lot of houses and throughout mine I say
[00:14:07] it just goes backwards from the present
[00:14:09] day - and the house I lived in when I
[00:14:11] was 16 maybe that's that's the one I got
[00:14:14] - at the okay and so yeah each each of
[00:14:19] the four words is in a separate room and
[00:14:21] then you know so I think of five
[00:14:23] different rooms in each each part of the
[00:14:25] house and then so I mean if you're
[00:14:27] training also you must have a lot all
[00:14:31] set up I'm guessing you have some
[00:14:33] specifically for words so I'm
[00:14:35] specifically for cars or do you mix them
[00:14:37] all together and yeah I have separate
[00:14:40] journey for each and just with words in
[00:14:46] my head and I also used to use that for
[00:14:48] abstract images because the two types
[00:14:50] add a totally different so there's no
[00:14:52] chance of getting confused but yeah
[00:14:53] cards has its own journey and binary
[00:14:56] numbers so yeah really makes them oh
[00:15:00] okay very interesting and then let's
[00:15:04] talk about names right so you're also on
[00:15:07] the you're also one of the top
[00:15:10] memorizers of names and you just as you
[00:15:12] told us before broke the record for
[00:15:14] international names at least that's
[00:15:16] probably the hardest because you have a
[00:15:18] combination of Chinese names and Indian
[00:15:22] names American native German names for
[00:15:25] first and last names it's just very
[00:15:27] worldly which makes it challenging the
[00:15:30] pretty long but she did 200 in 15
[00:15:33] minutes was which is awesome nobody's
[00:15:35] broken the 200 name barrier ever so
[00:15:41] what's your what's your technique there
[00:15:43] I mean are using much of a technique or
[00:15:46] are you just naturally good at names
[00:15:48] I don't consciously use any technique it
[00:15:52] may be if it's a very difficult name
[00:15:54] then I'll come up with something could
[00:15:56] it sounds like but other than that I
[00:15:58] just read the name and think about where
[00:16:00] that person might come from and just
[00:16:02] gonna clear the name really okay that's
[00:16:05] not fair okay so that's that's very
[00:16:08] incredibly I mean for us mortals we have
[00:16:12] to come up with a picture and this this
[00:16:14] kind of elaborate image creation but
[00:16:18] that's incredible you don't need to do
[00:16:21] much of that so I've heard around from
[00:16:25] other memory athletes that you and this
[00:16:27] probably helps with things like names
[00:16:29] and memorizing words but that you have
[00:16:31] synesthesia
[00:16:32] is that correct yeah and you know it's
[00:16:36] something that you know I wouldn't have
[00:16:38] really noticed until we're talking to
[00:16:41] you
[00:16:41] for instance Yaya who have the same
[00:16:44] thing and she's also very good at names
[00:16:46] and I think and it helps us both in the
[00:16:49] same way that every sort of word or name
[00:16:52] is associated with maybe a color or a
[00:16:54] texture or some sort of picture and I
[00:16:56] wouldn't say it's it's really really
[00:16:58] strong and obvious it's just like a
[00:17:00] subtle like image that's there in the
[00:17:03] background I think it really does help
[00:17:06] you know it means I don't get names
[00:17:08] mixed up because they might have
[00:17:10] completely different textures or colors
[00:17:11] what's an example something can you give
[00:17:14] us an example and okay like the name
[00:17:16] Cedric which turns up occasionally in
[00:17:19] memory leave names and that name don't
[00:17:22] taste like vinegar it's not my favorite
[00:17:28] name and all the way the name
[00:17:30] Pamela reminds me that that gets very
[00:17:32] Sheree it's articulate but yeah each
[00:17:36] name it's very distinct kind of feel
[00:17:38] interesting what is what is Nelson
[00:17:43] it's kind of blue and orange and yeah
[00:17:46] it's like some sort of some water on on
[00:17:49] metal and it's blue and orange okay I'm
[00:17:54] gonna ask you what that what that feels
[00:17:56] like when you've probably forgotten and
[00:17:59] hopefully you say the same thing that's
[00:18:04] great so you how did so you broke this
[00:18:07] your records at this European
[00:18:09] Championship last weekend what what did
[00:18:11] you end up in terms of your placing were
[00:18:14] you third yeah that's right behind em
[00:18:18] Alex and zoom on Reinhard yeah I was
[00:18:21] really pleased with that because you
[00:18:23] know I knew I wasn't up to anyway named
[00:18:26] Simon sled bull and Merlot and I had
[00:18:28] better there you know a bit of a
[00:18:30] friendly rivalry trying to and keep up
[00:18:32] with each other and yeah it was really
[00:18:34] really happy to get third and I was I
[00:18:36] was very happy with my points total yeah
[00:18:38] what was your final total points there I
[00:18:40] think it was six thousand two hundred
[00:18:42] sixteen so enough to get me up to 17th
[00:18:45] in the world which is really really nice
[00:18:48] yeah I was yeah I was very keen to get
[00:18:52] into the top twenty so yeah I was happy
[00:18:55] with that nice congratulations yeah
[00:18:56] that's a top score and are you what are
[00:19:00] your plans next for competing are you
[00:19:03] going to go to Singapore there's the
[00:19:05] World Championships there or are you
[00:19:07] done for 2016
[00:19:08] yeah that's me done for this year but
[00:19:10] I'm hoping to go to as many as I can
[00:19:12] next year so and if there's a none world
[00:19:14] in shape I would definitely be there and
[00:19:17] and if there's Championships in the UK
[00:19:19] then oh I'll be going yeah very cool and
[00:19:23] so for people out there who aren't
[00:19:27] they're just getting into memory sports
[00:19:30] and memory training what are some of the
[00:19:33] pieces of advice that you could give I
[00:19:34] mean based on your what do you do for
[00:19:37] training are you doing spending hours a
[00:19:40] day doing this you probably can you're
[00:19:43] working lady and you have children you
[00:19:45] probably have very limited time so
[00:19:48] what's your training schedule like and
[00:19:50] what do you recommend for someone who's
[00:19:52] starting out and yeah Percy in common
[00:19:56] to schedule say my kids are doing
[00:19:57] something quiet for a minute or they've
[00:19:58] gone to a friend's house or something
[00:20:00] it's it's not something I can plan I'm
[00:20:03] gonna spend an hour a day or anything
[00:20:04] like that but you know even I think if
[00:20:07] somebody starting out half an hour a day
[00:20:09] is you know it is enough to really make
[00:20:13] good progress and try a little bit of
[00:20:16] each sort of discipline every every day
[00:20:20] and a bit of cards a bit of numbers and
[00:20:24] that's what I would do try and try and
[00:20:26] cover everything and every day if
[00:20:29] possible
[00:20:29] another thing I'd love to talk about
[00:20:31] just because it's it's been very
[00:20:33] impressive at least to me how quickly
[00:20:36] you've gotten good at this is your cards
[00:20:40] and your numbers you know from what I
[00:20:43] had never really met you until before
[00:20:45] xmt but yeah from what I knew about you
[00:20:49] was you were the best at words and names
[00:20:52] and not really much else which was like
[00:20:55] the kind of okay great she's has
[00:20:57] weaknesses that's good but it seems like
[00:21:00] you've trained a lot and kind of tweaked
[00:21:03] your methods for some of the other more
[00:21:05] formal events like cards and numbers
[00:21:08] that require a system so what are you
[00:21:12] using I know we talked about this but to
[00:21:14] share with the listeners what are you
[00:21:15] using now for cards and numbers versus
[00:21:18] what you were doing before okay so I had
[00:21:21] a three data system and a two car system
[00:21:24] but that was completely based on
[00:21:26] categories and I that system and at
[00:21:30] least for the numbers for about eight
[00:21:31] years and I just wasn't getting very
[00:21:33] fast today
[00:21:34] and and I about a year ago started using
[00:21:37] them to make everything into syllables
[00:21:39] so each three-digit number would be
[00:21:42] pronounced dozen syllable but because I
[00:21:43] was using degrees the the word that I
[00:21:47] was making with the syllable wouldn't
[00:21:48] correspond with the actual image which
[00:21:51] sounds crazy now now that I tell you but
[00:21:53] that's what I was trying to do you know
[00:21:57] now I'm thinking well no one rolls and
[00:21:59] getting very fast so I'm trying explain
[00:22:02] what I've got now so d the first and
[00:22:05] last digit of the three is a consonant
[00:22:08] with the major system
[00:22:09] and the digit in the middle Isabelle
[00:22:13] so like to do today so 137 would be tick
[00:22:18] so I imagine a big green tick and card
[00:22:23] is basically this the same idea but the
[00:22:27] two values of the cards and that would
[00:22:30] be the the two consonants and the
[00:22:34] combination of the suits so there's
[00:22:37] eight different possibilities because
[00:22:40] I'm using only the black first
[00:22:44] combinations I'll explain that in a
[00:22:46] minute but there's a different suit
[00:22:48] combinations eight different vowels and
[00:22:49] yeah it's the same as the numbers it
[00:22:52] just makes one syllable and the idea
[00:22:56] with only using the black first pairs is
[00:22:58] something that your Hanus mallow created
[00:23:02] I think and also Alex Mallin used as
[00:23:04] this so you know it didn't speak good
[00:23:07] idea and is is that instead of having
[00:23:12] two thousand seven hundred four images
[00:23:13] you have only one thousand three hundred
[00:23:16] fifty two and you have it in each locus
[00:23:22] you memorize until you get to a black
[00:23:27] crowes pair so if it's if it's a red
[00:23:30] first pair I use the same image as I
[00:23:32] would do if it was black twist and and
[00:23:35] then stop when I get to two black crowes
[00:23:37] Ben does that make sense
[00:23:39] yeah makes perfect sense to me but
[00:23:43] that's that's super clever I mean
[00:23:46] especially you know sibling the the
[00:23:50] numbers and the card suits are the
[00:23:52] combinations down to a single syllable
[00:23:55] word which is turning the cards into
[00:23:58] something that you're unstoppable at
[00:24:00] which makes it that much more scary for
[00:24:03] the other competitors that's incredible
[00:24:05] so what's your what's your best card
[00:24:08] time in practice right now and in
[00:24:11] practice it's twenty-one point one four
[00:24:13] seconds Wow okay yeah that's cool I mean
[00:24:16] I never thought I'd get to these sort of
[00:24:18] times it's and it's really crazy you
[00:24:21] know before I change my system my best
[00:24:23] thirty-six seconds and that would you
[00:24:25] know it took me so long to get to that
[00:24:26] point and that was just a complete
[00:24:29] one-off so yeah after changing my system
[00:24:32] I I broke the thirty second barrier
[00:24:35] within two weeks I mean this is
[00:24:37] definitely the system I'm going to
[00:24:39] continue using because it's you know
[00:24:42] I've made so much progress and hopefully
[00:24:44] I can I can carry on because it would be
[00:24:46] so amazing to bring twenty seconds and
[00:24:49] it still seems impossible and and this
[00:24:52] weekend in the competition I I couldn't
[00:24:55] even get anywhere near that I mean it's
[00:24:57] totally different when you're sitting
[00:24:59] there in the real thing you know but in
[00:25:02] practice it's going well and you know
[00:25:04] you hit 21 yeah but how do you hit sub
[00:25:08] 20 sub 20 I mean so sub 30 so 25
[00:25:11] multiple times or yeah yeah I mean
[00:25:15] generally sub 30 yeah okay yeah so when
[00:25:19] you practice you typically expect to get
[00:25:21] twenty to thirty seconds somewhere yeah
[00:25:23] yes nice and what about numbers I guess
[00:25:27] a good measure like five minutes do you
[00:25:29] practice that one anymore or yeah I've
[00:25:34] recently broken the 300 bearing for the
[00:25:36] first time and couldn't quite do it at
[00:25:39] the competition this weekend but and
[00:25:40] yeah I got 320 in practice so and I just
[00:25:45] want I just want to keep going now and
[00:25:46] trying maybe get 400 one day so that
[00:25:51] leads me to the next question like
[00:25:52] what's what what are your goals now I
[00:25:54] mean you obviously love to compete in
[00:25:57] memory sports and you're getting better
[00:25:58] and I love that but is there something
[00:26:00] that's on like your bucket list is it is
[00:26:02] it getting that 400 digit in competition
[00:26:05] or is it under 20 seconds in competition
[00:26:08] is it a championship win what do you
[00:26:10] what would you like to do is just to be
[00:26:15] world champion but it's if you know
[00:26:17] that's obviously a very distant dream
[00:26:19] yeah definitely breaking to 20 seconds
[00:26:21] and clouds would be great because that
[00:26:22] was just something I never ever dreamed
[00:26:24] of and you know when I started to marry
[00:26:27] sports I think the speed car record was
[00:26:30] maybe 35 when I got it I got interested
[00:26:32] in reading banners and it seems unreal
[00:26:36] and
[00:26:37] it would be great to great 20 seconds
[00:26:39] yeah that's a good girl I would love to
[00:26:41] be somewhat close to that once again I
[00:26:44] yeah I mean once again now I've never
[00:26:47] gotten that close but I was around the
[00:26:50] 30-second mark pretty consistently but I
[00:26:54] kind of lost that speed I would love to
[00:26:56] get faster it's it's it's I hope that
[00:26:58] comes back one day one question I had
[00:27:01] for you being a woman I get this
[00:27:03] question all the time why are there less
[00:27:07] women in memory competitions than men
[00:27:09] and I I say I don't know I usually say
[00:27:13] it because women know that they have a
[00:27:15] good memory ready they don't need to
[00:27:16] prove it plans do you have any idea
[00:27:21] because it's you know the top is pretty
[00:27:24] crowded with with men I mean it's Union
[00:27:27] juh Melanie from Germany's coming up as
[00:27:30] well there's some Chinese competitors as
[00:27:32] well but most of it is men why what do
[00:27:35] you think yeah it's a good question um
[00:27:37] I'm not sure I know the answer
[00:27:39] I mean whenever I talk about memory
[00:27:41] sports to my friends the the men are
[00:27:44] always much more interested in hearing
[00:27:45] about it I don't know why that is and I
[00:27:48] think some of the women just say oh
[00:27:50] isn't it a bit geeky you know it doesn't
[00:27:53] have the same appeal that whereas the
[00:27:55] men like wow that sounds really cool I'd
[00:27:57] love to learn these systems and yeah I I
[00:28:00] don't know why that should be the way it
[00:28:02] is but yeah it'd be great if more women
[00:28:07] can quit in you know would enter
[00:28:09] competitions in give it a go do you do
[00:28:11] any memory training like on the side
[00:28:14] like business lines or no I give in the
[00:28:19] old lesson but that's about it and it's
[00:28:21] not something I'm really going to and I
[00:28:22] guess I don't have much time I work and
[00:28:24] the kids so and memory training
[00:28:26] obviously and in my own training so yeah
[00:28:29] it might be something I I do in the
[00:28:32] future but yeah the moment I just I just
[00:28:35] want to train as much as possible and
[00:28:36] and I'm just having so much fun with it
[00:28:39] and you know I just love going to the
[00:28:41] competition's meeting all the people and
[00:28:44] it's such a lovely community of athletes
[00:28:47] yeah that yeah
[00:28:50] the best thing to do it this is so much
[00:28:53] fun and what's something I mean I didn't
[00:28:56] know that you were so talented with
[00:28:58] languages I mean it makes sense but what
[00:29:00] else is something about you that doesn't
[00:29:02] have to do with memory at all that
[00:29:04] people may not know what to do we get my
[00:29:15] team through Alexandra it's a very small
[00:29:17] team and my husband sports Liverpool so
[00:29:20] yeah we love watching them and we go to
[00:29:22] as many matches as we can
[00:29:24] and we take my little boy who and he's
[00:29:26] stubborn and he loves watching as well
[00:29:28] so yeah as a football fanatic are you
[00:29:35] crazy about it like you you'll like
[00:29:38] shout out the TV and go to matches and
[00:29:41] stuff and yeah that's awesome I would
[00:29:44] love to see well that's great thank you
[00:29:50] so much for sharing some of that I hope
[00:29:53] the listeners that inspire some of
[00:29:56] though I'm sure you know a lot of people
[00:29:58] like I said before really want to know
[00:29:59] how to do words names and how you know
[00:30:04] to train different ways to get faster
[00:30:06] and you're the perfect example for that
[00:30:08] so thank you for that I look forward to
[00:30:11] seeing you in some competition next year
[00:30:13] you totally you destroyed me at
[00:30:18] the memory lis championships last last
[00:30:21] month so hopefully I'm gonna try to get
[00:30:23] some revenge at some point but thank you
[00:30:27] Jimmy good to hear from you I'll see you
[00:30:30] soon
[00:30:30] great thank you for having me on the
[00:30:32] show good salty

=== Nelson Dellis' MIND SHOW - Barbara Oakley // MOOC Instructor Extraordinaire ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN-c_YEEiFU

[00:00:14] hello and welcome to another episode of
[00:00:17] the minds show with me your host Nelson
[00:00:20] Dellis for time USA memory champion
[00:00:24] guests they're always special
[00:00:27] I have Barbara Oakley who is a professor
[00:00:29] of engineering at Oakland University and
[00:00:32] she's probably better known for her
[00:00:36] massive online course this MOOC called
[00:00:42] learning how to learn and it's got
[00:00:45] millions of people who have completed
[00:00:47] the course and it's one of the most
[00:00:48] popular learning courses out there
[00:00:52] there aren't many and I share a little
[00:00:55] interview with her at the end of that
[00:00:57] course so you can you've probably seen
[00:00:59] me there if you're taking the course and
[00:01:01] we're gonna be talking about number of
[00:01:03] things how she got into the course her
[00:01:05] background and her new book which she's
[00:01:08] so kindly given me a copy to read and
[00:01:13] give a little blurb about but before we
[00:01:16] get into that as usual I'd love to thank
[00:01:18] my sponsor dart neuroscience they run a
[00:01:24] massive research project called the
[00:01:27] extreme memory challenge which I helped
[00:01:29] promote and if you go to extreme memory
[00:01:32] challenge calm you can take this memory
[00:01:35] test you can help them with their
[00:01:37] research the research is aimed at ending
[00:01:40] these cognitive disabling diseases as
[00:01:45] many of you know what's important to me
[00:01:46] is Alzheimer's disease that's something
[00:01:48] my grandmother passed away from and
[00:01:50] that's why I started improving my memory
[00:01:52] in the first place so to help out with
[00:01:54] cause or a research project that could
[00:01:58] potentially provide a cure or treatment
[00:02:01] for it is all good in my book and I hope
[00:02:05] that's all good in your book so the test
[00:02:08] is really easy it's really easy to help
[00:02:10] out it's free there's no
[00:02:12] other than you gotta give me ten minutes
[00:02:14] of your time
[00:02:16] and take this test a memory test just
[00:02:18] see how good your memory test is the
[00:02:20] idea behind the test is we want to get a
[00:02:22] million people to take the test which is
[00:02:24] a huge number very difficult to get a
[00:02:26] million people to do anything these days
[00:02:28] especially for ten minutes so this only
[00:02:32] works if you take it you share it
[00:02:33] whether your memory is good or bad we
[00:02:36] really need to get the whole spectrum
[00:02:38] it's important to have as many test
[00:02:40] takers it's possible for the results to
[00:02:41] be of significance and with those
[00:02:44] results we'll be able to really
[00:02:46] understand how to map really be able to
[00:02:52] map out long-term memory in in humans
[00:02:56] and once we see the full spectrum we'll
[00:02:59] will be able to analyze specific
[00:03:01] outliers more in depth and do DNA
[00:03:06] samples and stuff like that
[00:03:08] that's if you're at the top part of the
[00:03:11] performing ranks but otherwise just
[00:03:14] think of it as a fun test helping out
[00:03:15] research and yeah extreme memory
[00:03:19] challenge comm please head there and
[00:03:21] without any further delay let's jump
[00:03:24] into the interview now hello everyone
[00:03:27] this is Nelson Dellis another episode of
[00:03:30] the vine show and today we have the
[00:03:32] amazing Barbara Oakley she's a professor
[00:03:35] of engineering at complete University
[00:03:38] and
[00:03:40] for what most people know is she has
[00:03:42] this amazing course about to learn and
[00:03:45] is the author working on another book
[00:03:48] your online course is one of the biggest
[00:03:52] online courses that I can think of is
[00:03:55] that right
[00:03:57] actually it is as far as we know it's
[00:04:00] the biggest online massive online course
[00:04:03] in the world we've had around one point
[00:04:05] it's close to 1.7 million registered
[00:04:09] learners now so it just it's because
[00:04:14] it's got a lot of very practically
[00:04:16] useful information about mine yeah I do
[00:04:21] a lot of things one of the things I do
[00:04:22] is I teach of the University down here
[00:04:24] in Miami part-time just because I love
[00:04:26] it in computer science so yeah nothing
[00:04:29] to do necessarily as well close to
[00:04:31] engineering but I get a lot of students
[00:04:34] who I'm their TA I don't say like I'm a
[00:04:36] memory guy or anything I just teach them
[00:04:38] of course but uh a lot of them have been
[00:04:41] like I know I saw you know when we did
[00:04:44] that interview last year they have seen
[00:04:45] it and they've taken your course a lot
[00:04:47] of them of taking your course it's it's
[00:04:49] it's very interesting to hear from
[00:04:51] people who you don't expect but who have
[00:04:53] seen and then taking your course so
[00:04:55] that's amazing I think the thing is that
[00:04:59] your bonus interview on the course is it
[00:05:04] just has a lot of great insights a lot
[00:05:06] of practically useful ideas and people
[00:05:09] get a lot of take away out of that so
[00:05:11] good on you thank you thanks for having
[00:05:14] me I'll post a link obviously to that
[00:05:16] that course the lots of people can check
[00:05:18] it out if they haven't but I'd love to
[00:05:20] know how that came to be you know where
[00:05:25] did you obviously your professor you
[00:05:27] teach people you've observed people
[00:05:29] learning but when did you say to
[00:05:31] yourself you know I need to write well I
[00:05:34] guess it started with your book right a
[00:05:36] mind for numbers all right yeah it's a
[00:05:39] good question because what would the
[00:05:41] book come from and and the book came
[00:05:44] from a student just asking me a question
[00:05:46] like me he had been in the
[00:05:50] and he was trying to change himself and
[00:05:53] become an engineer and of course he
[00:05:55] thought it was very difficult for him
[00:05:57] because he he had just been a
[00:06:00] technologist and getting the math and so
[00:06:03] forth and he was like it was hard and he
[00:06:07] had he found out about my past that I
[00:06:09] had been in the military I had been a
[00:06:11] linguist a Russian linguist and he said
[00:06:14] how did you do it how did you change
[00:06:16] your brain and I thought oh well I wrote
[00:06:20] them a few little notes in an email and
[00:06:23] I thought oh there's so much more I can
[00:06:26] actually write a little book about this
[00:06:28] and it would just take me a month or two
[00:06:30] of course of that to make it look really
[00:06:36] simple and easy but that's that's where
[00:06:40] it came from and I think part of it is
[00:06:41] just realizing that there's these there
[00:06:45] are these negative skills between
[00:06:47] learning that apply whether you're
[00:06:49] learning a language whether you're
[00:06:50] learning in math and science or dance or
[00:06:53] there or even mountain climbing and they
[00:06:57] all relate for what we know how our
[00:07:02] brain works for neuroscience and so I
[00:07:05] thought we just communicate that it
[00:07:07] would be very helpful to people and so
[00:07:09] from the success of that book did you
[00:07:12] then say okay I'm gonna try to create a
[00:07:14] course that'll be available online or
[00:07:16] did someone approach you how did that
[00:07:18] come to be
[00:07:19] well I volunteered in an inner urban
[00:07:22] school district for five years and I and
[00:07:26] the kids were incredible just incredible
[00:07:29] but I became very much aware that the
[00:07:32] people that you most want to reach about
[00:07:35] learning often or not their narrator
[00:07:38] ebooks that that's their not so if the
[00:07:42] school system is not conducive to
[00:07:44] allowing that to happen and I mean
[00:07:46] there's there's just not emphasis on
[00:07:48] that but hey they don't watch videos I
[00:07:52] want to create a course where I really
[00:07:55] reach the people who most would like
[00:07:59] these kinds of ideas and you can
[00:08:01] actually reach them so much better
[00:08:03] because you can walk through your
[00:08:05] metaphors instead of just describing
[00:08:07] emerald words and also it was a lot of
[00:08:11] fun and I worked with my my
[00:08:14] co-instructor is turns and I'll see the
[00:08:16] places critic professor at the Salk
[00:08:18] Institute I mean this guy is like
[00:08:20] totally a neuro ninja so we we admit and
[00:08:30] then we got to talking and we decided
[00:08:34] was trying to do a book together and a
[00:08:37] MOOC is massive open online course and
[00:08:40] so Terry really helped make it happen he
[00:08:43] has a dream to point at University of
[00:08:46] California San Diego and so he got it
[00:08:50] okay and now I'd love to kind of jump
[00:08:53] back a bit and talk about your past I
[00:08:56] just discovered this a little bit of
[00:08:58] research on you because we had never
[00:09:00] talked about it but my adventure
[00:09:02] background and exploring and just going
[00:09:05] to these cold places is part of me and
[00:09:08] obviously you know I realized it's part
[00:09:10] of your background tell me about so from
[00:09:15] what I understood you worked in the
[00:09:16] South Pole is that right or this okay it
[00:09:19] was at the South Pole Station and in
[00:09:21] fact so I met my husband there and so
[00:09:26] three weeks I can we met he proposed and
[00:09:28] could meet after that as soon as we got
[00:09:30] off the ice suite we got married in a
[00:09:32] Coronas England and so I always say I
[00:09:35] had to go to the end of the earth to
[00:09:37] meet that man but he that's when I was
[00:09:42] 32 years ago and it was the smartest
[00:09:45] decision I ever made was to say yes when
[00:09:48] he proposed yeah and so what were you
[00:09:52] guys doing we were starting global
[00:09:56] warming he was in charge of the garage
[00:10:05] operations and I was a radio operator so
[00:10:09] it was he was really
[00:10:12] I didn't know on station because you
[00:10:14] could get in a vehicle straight and go
[00:10:16] travel off to the garbage dump which is
[00:10:18] about one of the big things you could do
[00:10:20] with the stuff there's nothing so we go
[00:10:26] off to the garbage dump together you
[00:10:28] know have exciting adventures I had a
[00:10:32] friend close friend I haven't heard from
[00:10:34] in a couple years he's always traveling
[00:10:36] but he did some cycles and I remember
[00:10:40] the South Pole or dermo is it
[00:10:42] McMurdo yeah he was working for Raytheon
[00:10:45] I don't know if they're still
[00:10:46] contracting people out there but he was
[00:10:48] living in the South Pole for months at a
[00:10:51] time and we would catch up on beers in
[00:10:53] Miami every once in a while and I
[00:10:55] remember this was like 10 years ago we
[00:10:57] were in a bar and it was me him and
[00:11:01] another guy just showed up from my
[00:11:03] physics lab and he had also spent time
[00:11:06] in the South Pole so I was saying at the
[00:11:09] time I hadn't climbed Everest but I've
[00:11:11] been to McKinley in climbed Denali so
[00:11:14] the between the three of us we had you
[00:11:16] know in Miami it just seemed like okay
[00:11:18] there's two guys who's bent on tariqa
[00:11:20] and and me who's been to the Arctic
[00:11:22] Circle whatever how rare would that be
[00:11:25] in Miami you know but what my question
[00:11:28] is is how did you get to the South Pole
[00:11:30] what what brought you there it was your
[00:11:32] engineering background or oh so the
[00:11:37] thing is and I think this is important
[00:11:40] for people of all backgrounds to keep in
[00:11:43] mind is sometimes doors open for you and
[00:11:47] I think people often it it opens so
[00:11:51] fleetingly that you can say you know it
[00:11:54] just doesn't it doesn't work or
[00:11:56] something so for me I had been in the
[00:12:00] military and I've been a signal officer
[00:12:03] so I worked with communication systems
[00:12:06] and so forth and my mother had been
[00:12:08] working down in Antarctica and so she
[00:12:10] showed me all these pictures and I was
[00:12:12] like Lena that's so cool
[00:12:13] I'd love to go there nieces oh you know
[00:12:16] there's a position opening up as the
[00:12:18] radio operator at the South Pole Station
[00:12:20] now what I coulda said was oh I'm in my
[00:12:25] engineer
[00:12:25] studies you know I just can't take six
[00:12:28] months off and do that kind of thing and
[00:12:30] instead of like yeah you know let's go
[00:12:33] for it and so I put my application in
[00:12:35] and little did I know that it was
[00:12:38] basically once you go over there an
[00:12:40] interview it's basically are you a
[00:12:42] mammal check okay but here's another
[00:12:52] thing so when I worked on Soviet
[00:12:55] trawlers it was out on the Bering Sea
[00:12:58] and it was because I had trained as a
[00:13:00] Russian linguist in the army and I
[00:13:03] remember I put my application into the
[00:13:05] company and then the company called me
[00:13:08] and said we'd like you to come out and
[00:13:11] start work next month and I just I was
[00:13:14] in the middle of my studies and I was
[00:13:16] just gonna start my next semester the
[00:13:19] next month and so I said yeah I don't
[00:13:20] think so
[00:13:21] and so my father overheard this
[00:13:24] conversation because I was not visiting
[00:13:26] him and he was like you did what what so
[00:13:32] I called consequently after the little
[00:13:34] discussion and I called them back up and
[00:13:36] went back out and said no I'll go for it
[00:13:40] and I ended up working out there of
[00:13:43] course it was a absolutely phenomenal
[00:13:46] experience and I feel very blessed that
[00:13:50] my my father was like looking on right
[00:13:53] then and so with my knee-jerk reaction
[00:13:56] of no I already know what I'm going to
[00:13:58] be doing okay draw me back and say let's
[00:14:02] easily come it says here how many
[00:14:04] opportunities do you get to do these
[00:14:06] kinds of things
[00:14:07] another key yeah how many years you end
[00:14:11] up doing that it was two fishing seasons
[00:14:14] so about a year altogether so so I mean
[00:14:18] that's about what your leader can really
[00:14:20] take this is the
[00:14:37] was that very first day that I ever
[00:14:39] taught a class and I was I was being
[00:14:43] evaluated as he was and I'd get hired
[00:14:45] for this tenure-track position and I was
[00:14:48] a nervous wreck
[00:14:49] I've never taught a class before in my
[00:14:51] life and I was totally shy and so but I
[00:14:54] thought you know there is only one time
[00:14:56] in my life I could ever do this and that
[00:14:59] is today because they never they don't
[00:15:01] know who I am so I walked in and I said
[00:15:05] hello I am - bottom I luckily I have
[00:15:09] luck teaching English I love burned up
[00:15:12] spending in Malaysia I am teaching
[00:15:14] ethics and dynamics and like I was so
[00:15:19] nervous which was so easy to do because
[00:15:22] I told it was that I turn around wrote
[00:15:24] my name and it's really on the board and
[00:15:26] I turn around they were getting out
[00:15:28] there add drop cards and I just started
[00:15:31] laughing from now on no matter what I
[00:15:36] did all the stupidest errors in the
[00:15:39] world in that course they they forgave
[00:15:41] me I'm sure they were like one of those
[00:15:51] teachers I can't understand that's yeah
[00:15:54] but but of course they couldn't
[00:15:56] understand me but because I was funny
[00:16:00] about it that's great so then so
[00:16:04] obviously you then finished your your
[00:16:06] your schooling after that and then went
[00:16:09] on TV professor at have you been at
[00:16:12] Oakley all this time or Oakland
[00:16:15] University or for just about 20 years
[00:16:19] now and I think that's three actually it
[00:16:24] Ellis traits a very important point
[00:16:26] about learning in general and that is if
[00:16:29] you can have a sense of humor about
[00:16:31] whatever you're learning it can make it
[00:16:34] come down so much better even especially
[00:16:37] what it is frustrating or difficult so
[00:16:39] this is why I think it's important to
[00:16:41] look for instructors who have a sense of
[00:16:43] humor because they can just make it so
[00:16:45] much nicer yeah I find that often when
[00:16:48] I'm trying to explain different
[00:16:50] programming concepts to students there
[00:16:53] everybody learns differently so you know
[00:16:55] sometimes the way I do it in general on
[00:16:57] the board
[00:16:57] most people get but there's certain few
[00:16:59] don't and so I have to find different
[00:17:02] ways to get to that person whether it's
[00:17:04] through some type of light-hearted humor
[00:17:06] more understanding ideas or examples
[00:17:12] that they can understand you know
[00:17:14] different associative kind of relative
[00:17:18] ideas but but yeah it comes down to
[00:17:21] trying to relate to the student and that
[00:17:24] can often be through being funny and
[00:17:27] open and willing to do it to explain it
[00:17:30] in different ways yeah there's some
[00:17:32] truth and it doesn't make me laugh
[00:17:35] because story I just submitted a paper
[00:17:37] and some of the reviewers comments came
[00:17:41] back as in you're saying humor is
[00:17:43] important but there was this paper in
[00:17:45] 1973 and it says humors extraneous and
[00:17:49] if you go look at the paper
[00:17:51] it's like humor in books not in it when
[00:17:56] you're actually teaching and face to
[00:17:58] face and one of the authors of that
[00:18:01] paper it's like the funniest public
[00:18:03] speaker when he's giving presentations
[00:18:05] he's always giving this off that come so
[00:18:08] I think that there's this often a a
[00:18:15] predisposition or a bias amongst many
[00:18:18] professors that humor is a bad thing and
[00:18:20] it's only because it's so hard to do
[00:18:22] that they'd rather not do it that's what
[00:18:26] you get away from doing that from trying
[00:18:29] to be funny is just to say it's not
[00:18:30] important yeah let's let's talk a little
[00:18:36] bit about the actual course itself and
[00:18:40] maybe some of the top say three things
[00:18:43] that for the listeners out there that
[00:18:46] for how learning how to learn what are
[00:18:48] the three most important things you
[00:18:50] think that are crucial to it to learning
[00:18:54] as a skill I guess okay the one that
[00:18:58] people so people comment on three
[00:19:00] different things well they're coming
[00:19:03] and thanks but but it often centers
[00:19:05] around three things the first one is the
[00:19:08] Pomodoro Technique so procrastination is
[00:19:12] a huge issue in studying and yet when
[00:19:15] psychologists talk about the best
[00:19:17] techniques for studying they it's like
[00:19:19] they skip right over the part where you
[00:19:21] procrastinate it's like well let's see
[00:19:25] and then we talk about in Windows II
[00:19:28] because all the other that
[00:19:30] procrastination part is a huge part to
[00:19:32] escape so the bottom line is use the
[00:19:36] Pomodoro Technique which is that was
[00:19:40] invented by a wonderful Italian
[00:19:42] Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s and you
[00:19:44] just you said turn off all distractions
[00:19:48] which is actually more difficult than
[00:19:51] you think to do the first couple times
[00:19:54] you do it but it gets easier
[00:19:55] so no cell phone buzzes none no little
[00:19:59] signals coming up from your computer or
[00:20:02] anything like that so turn off all
[00:20:03] distractions said time for 25 minutes
[00:20:06] and then work as intently as you can
[00:20:09] knowing that your mind will sometimes
[00:20:11] come up with distracting thoughts just
[00:20:13] let him go by and keep working for 25
[00:20:16] minutes and when you're done reward
[00:20:19] yourself
[00:20:19] wait this is a song you like walk do
[00:20:22] whatever you might like and and what we
[00:20:26] know now from nurses he's learning
[00:20:28] continues to take place during that time
[00:20:31] when you're not focusing when you're
[00:20:33] relaxing and so that's part of why this
[00:20:36] relaxation is so important we always
[00:20:39] have this feeling that were all alerted
[00:20:41] when we're focusing but that's simply
[00:20:43] not true
[00:20:43] yeah see that's the first thing and and
[00:20:47] so going more into that so let's say you
[00:20:50] know you have your day set out for you
[00:20:52] right whether you're working from home
[00:20:54] you're studying or you're at your job
[00:20:55] your desk it's 25 minutes and then a
[00:20:59] break a break or a rest what's the best
[00:21:03] or recommended time to rest so obviously
[00:21:06] you're gonna start looking at cat
[00:21:07] pictures and listening to music it's
[00:21:10] easy to be like I'm gonna hang out a
[00:21:12] little more before I go back to work
[00:21:14] what's one what are the intervals
[00:21:16] supposed to be
[00:21:16] like okay it really does depend on you
[00:21:20] I will admit for me if I start getting
[00:21:23] into the flow I'm just right on going
[00:21:26] past Lincoln in five minutes oh but but
[00:21:30] it does depend so if you have a budding
[00:21:33] examination you're right before finals
[00:21:36] or something it might be three minutes
[00:21:38] but if you have just sort of you're
[00:21:42] trying to get a certain number done
[00:21:44] during the day of Pomodoro's or
[00:21:46] something like that then maybe five ten
[00:21:47] fifteen minutes you might ask why is why
[00:21:51] was the magic number twenty five minutes
[00:21:54] and that was because at that time my
[00:21:59] sense is that it's five minutes less
[00:22:02] than half an hour so it seems very
[00:22:03] doable but now what we know is see
[00:22:07] procrastination arises a lot of times
[00:22:11] sometimes at least because when you even
[00:22:15] think about something you don't want to
[00:22:17] do it causes a pain to arise in your
[00:22:20] bringing the king centers of your brain
[00:22:21] so what you do is you turn your
[00:22:25] attention to something else because that
[00:22:27] may go away like instantly but you do it
[00:22:31] once or twice it's no big deal but very
[00:22:33] often and it's procrastination and it's
[00:22:36] linking addiction so anyway that pain
[00:22:39] that arises when you think about
[00:22:41] something you don't want to do when you
[00:22:42] start actually working on it it turns
[00:22:44] out that ping dissipates in 20 minutes
[00:22:48] so when you find in its cage you might
[00:22:50] casa it gives you into the flow things
[00:22:52] yeah I guess the idea is what you said
[00:22:55] you get in the flow and you just kind of
[00:22:57] keep on going but at least you go into
[00:23:00] it thinking it's only twenty five
[00:23:01] minutes and I get arrest exactly right
[00:23:04] and always having that that ability to
[00:23:07] say okay I did my twenty five minutes
[00:23:09] and like the rest is a really freeing
[00:23:11] sort of thing and then sometimes doing
[00:23:14] exactly that
[00:23:15] yeah yeah okay so that's number one
[00:23:18] Pomodoro Technique learning how to deal
[00:23:20] with procrastination I guess right
[00:23:22] exactly what else whatever the next -
[00:23:25] okay the next the next one is
[00:23:30] that your brain has two different
[00:23:34] fundamentally fundamentally different
[00:23:36] modes of operation one is when you're
[00:23:39] focusing on something so I call that a
[00:23:42] focus mode more literally in
[00:23:44] Psychological terms it would be called
[00:23:47] something like the task positive Network
[00:23:49] s-- the other mode is its I call it the
[00:23:55] diffuse mode and it's actually said some
[00:23:57] couples in neural resting States the
[00:23:59] most prominent of which is the default
[00:24:01] mode Network
[00:24:02] so you're basically what this means is
[00:24:04] you're either focusing or you're not
[00:24:07] thinking about anything in particular
[00:24:08] you're just sort of relaxing your brain
[00:24:10] like you're stealing the shower it'd be
[00:24:12] the spots maybe darning randomly around
[00:24:14] but you're not directing those thoughts
[00:24:16] and so it turns out that learning means
[00:24:21] an alternation between those two modes
[00:24:24] so you focus you get really stuck when
[00:24:28] you're frustrated
[00:24:29] you have to stop get your attention off
[00:24:32] it start focusing on it and only by
[00:24:36] stopping put the focus didn't gain
[00:24:38] access to this other diffuse network
[00:24:41] which is often the network is more
[00:24:44] broad-ranging network that can get you
[00:24:47] to the new place you need to be and
[00:24:50] mentally in order to begin solving the
[00:24:52] problem so what happens these people
[00:24:56] often sit down and they focus and they
[00:24:58] can't figure it right out and so they
[00:25:00] think oh I must be really stupid and
[00:25:02] instead of thinking oh this is the 24th
[00:25:06] version I need to walk away and let my
[00:25:08] diffuse node work on it they've been
[00:25:10] kind of stupid and so then they begin to
[00:25:13] think they had no talent from that area
[00:25:15] which actually is not true at all it's
[00:25:19] just that people learn at different
[00:25:21] speeds and and this sort of stepping
[00:25:25] back is often in a critical part of the
[00:25:27] learning process yeah I remember in my
[00:25:30] physics days I got my degree in physics
[00:25:33] we have some really hard for homework
[00:25:36] sets and sometimes you know I work on
[00:25:38] them and be stuck on two or three of
[00:25:40] them that were the hard ones but I'd go
[00:25:42] swim or run
[00:25:43] and step away from it I remember often
[00:25:46] solving those problems not exactly to
[00:25:50] the end but figuring out a different
[00:25:51] approach or something that occurred to
[00:25:53] me while I was kind of in that resting
[00:25:55] state brain state mindless you know not
[00:25:59] trying to figure it out that just kind
[00:26:00] of thinking about things and you know I
[00:26:02] just had these ideas that would come to
[00:26:04] me when I wasn't really focused on it
[00:26:06] which is exactly what you're saying it
[00:26:08] precisely you you really put your finger
[00:26:11] on how that happens yeah okay that's a
[00:26:15] very good one and then third one I mean
[00:26:17] I'm sure there's more than three but
[00:26:18] just the top three okay a third one is
[00:26:23] that it's kind of combined thing people
[00:26:27] sometimes are slow problem solvers right
[00:26:31] or they think more slowly than other
[00:26:34] people true and for example in class I
[00:26:37] can have some question and sometimes my
[00:26:39] mouth drops open because like the last
[00:26:42] word is coming out of my mouth that's a
[00:26:45] really difficult question about
[00:26:47] basically room or something like that
[00:26:49] and some kid will have this hand up and
[00:26:52] the fact that I could never have done
[00:26:56] that myself
[00:26:57] it really it's like they have racecar
[00:27:01] grins and other people have more like
[00:27:04] hyper brains okay they get to the same
[00:27:07] place but it's much more slowly and but
[00:27:11] think about it this way a hiker they get
[00:27:16] them more slowly but they can reach out
[00:27:18] and touch the pine needles they can
[00:27:20] smell the pine forest they can see the
[00:27:23] little rabbit traps they hear the birds
[00:27:24] they have a completely different
[00:27:26] experience from the person who's the
[00:27:29] racecar driver
[00:27:30] and so in some ways that can be richer
[00:27:34] and deeper my hero in science is a
[00:27:37] company by the name of Santiago Ramon y
[00:27:39] Cajal he's a wonderful human being and
[00:27:42] he won the Nobel Prize for it is
[00:27:44] considered the father of modern
[00:27:45] neuroscience and he said I am no genius
[00:27:50] and it wasn't I mean he wasn't some fast
[00:27:53]  he was very persistent and he
[00:27:56] could fly
[00:27:57] simply change his mind when he find him
[00:27:59] something wrong he said I have worked
[00:28:02] with many geniuses and the thing about
[00:28:06] geniuses is they're so used to being
[00:28:07] right that they've jumped to conclusions
[00:28:10] and then they can't change their mind
[00:28:12] when they're wrong they're not used to
[00:28:14] doing it so they'll continue on and
[00:28:17] pursue paths that are kind of flagrantly
[00:28:20] wrong just anyone who looks very
[00:28:23] carefully if you look at the history of
[00:28:25] science that is so true you'll see all
[00:28:28] these incredible geniuses who are like
[00:28:30] there's no such thing as neurogenesis we
[00:28:33] know that neurons can't be born in the
[00:28:35] brain and of course that's completely
[00:28:36] untrue but but they have concluded that
[00:28:39] and you can't change them so I think
[00:28:42] it's it's thrilling for people to
[00:28:45] realize that you don't need to be a
[00:28:47] freakin genius to actually contribute
[00:28:50] more than some geniuses can do and in
[00:28:54] fact you can contribute a lot just with
[00:28:56] a applauding Lea persistence and
[00:28:59] flexible mentality yeah that's a very
[00:29:02] very good point yeah very good thank you
[00:29:06] for those let's talk a little bit about
[00:29:09] your upcoming book I don't know if
[00:29:11] that's mine shift is that right
[00:29:17] it's like and it is about how do
[00:29:22] you broaden your passion how to do
[00:29:26] something that see where we you know we
[00:29:29] always told follow your passion and so
[00:29:31] forth and but passions develop only
[00:29:34] about what you're good at
[00:29:35] okay so how you develop in they say
[00:29:41] you're not good at already and that
[00:29:44] often is what the world is calling for
[00:29:46] so this I travel around the world and I
[00:29:50] interview learner's from around the
[00:29:53] world and I also talked to top
[00:29:55] scientists and about how you can learn
[00:29:59] things that you never thought you could
[00:30:01] learn and it kind of become become a
[00:30:05] person that you never thought you could
[00:30:07] become so it's it was
[00:30:10] a lot of fun working on this book and I
[00:30:13] learned a lot myself for example I never
[00:30:17] knew that video games could be so
[00:30:20] helpful in especially as you get a
[00:30:24] little older and making sure your brain
[00:30:26] stays sharp yeah where we school video
[00:30:30] games out like right there green or
[00:30:32] green like it's it's really untrue I
[00:30:36] suppose a poly brain running times or
[00:30:39] something but but even video games like
[00:30:42] Tetris can expand your your spatial
[00:30:46] abilities and so forth and people so
[00:30:48] often think oh I don't have spatial
[00:30:50] skills so I can't I can't become an
[00:30:53] artist or an engineer or something like
[00:30:55] that but they don't realize that that
[00:30:57] you can actually see people's brains
[00:31:01] changing as they practice with some of
[00:31:05] these kinds of skills using things like
[00:31:07] Tetris and so forth and you can become
[00:31:10] much much better and enjoyed in your
[00:31:12] abilities the people peg themselves I
[00:31:16] think a lot when I take some kind of a
[00:31:18] test and say oh this is where my skill
[00:31:21] set and what I'm good at these are my
[00:31:23] talents and I should do that but these
[00:31:25] kinds of tests never tell you about how
[00:31:28] you can change and I think your ability
[00:31:31] changes is far more employment yes so
[00:31:35] would you say the book is about you know
[00:31:39] people trying to follow their dreams and
[00:31:42] trying to figure out what they should be
[00:31:45] doing based on what they know and their
[00:31:47] skills and what they want to be able to
[00:31:50] do I mean what's what's the ending
[00:31:52] what's like the snippet the one sentence
[00:31:55] message of this book it's it's more than
[00:31:58] like all your passion right it's it's
[00:32:02] passion I think one snippet they can put
[00:32:07] it isn't sort of how to get to where you
[00:32:11] want to go with your innate skill set is
[00:32:18] how to develop new skill sets and new
[00:32:23] soon
[00:32:24] new talents and and what that can do for
[00:32:28] your life if you do that because we
[00:32:32] offer for example the opening stories
[00:32:35] about this there from young man grand
[00:32:38] care who was is one of the top
[00:32:41] guitarists in the country and so he was
[00:32:45] at Julliard and you know here he is a
[00:32:49] superstar he hated math and science
[00:32:51] totally I mean flunked it was awful
[00:32:54] attic and burned his books when he
[00:32:58] graduated from high school in chemistry
[00:33:01] because he did somebody and so here he's
[00:33:04] going on
[00:33:05] he's superstar stuff and he starts
[00:33:08] giving these concerts for cancer
[00:33:11] pediatric cancer patients and he begins
[00:33:14] to realize that you know wait a minute
[00:33:17] when I get these concert performances
[00:33:19] I'll never see these people ever again
[00:33:22] but these kids I get many matters to me
[00:33:28] and so almost it just time occurred him
[00:33:31] he wanted to be a doctor and but and his
[00:33:35] friends are like you are completely
[00:33:38] insane cannot do this because you're
[00:33:41] you're one of the best in the country as
[00:33:44] far as you can absolutely no talent
[00:33:47] whatsoever for eating in math and
[00:33:49] science
[00:33:49] you're an idiot and he's sitting there
[00:33:52] studying for a chemistry exam knowing
[00:33:57] that his friend is at the Super Bowl
[00:33:59] with Beyonce and he could have been
[00:34:02] doing that too and and he's just sitting
[00:34:05] there boy I'm crazy I'm crazy for doing
[00:34:08] this and of course now he's he couldn't
[00:34:11] be happier he's in his third year and
[00:34:13] George Washington's School of Medicine
[00:34:16] and is doing fantastic so you can really
[00:34:20] change in ways you never could have
[00:34:23] imagined and this is that's just one
[00:34:27] example of does someone have done
[00:34:29] something like that it's I mean it's a
[00:34:31] fascinating thing I always struggle with
[00:34:34] well I don't always struggle but I go
[00:34:36] through
[00:34:37] cycles where I'm not quite sure what I'm
[00:34:40] doing with my life it's really what I'm
[00:34:42] passionate about sure everybody goes
[00:34:43] through this but you know I went to
[00:34:46] school did physics switch to computer
[00:34:49] science through my masters and ended up
[00:34:51] getting a job as an engineer for Wolfram
[00:34:55] research and it was cool but I felt like
[00:34:58] it wasn't what I was meant to do and
[00:34:59] eventually the memory thing I was doing
[00:35:01] on the side ended up being what I've
[00:35:03] been doing for the past seven eight
[00:35:06] years at the time I was like this is my
[00:35:09] passion this is my calling and it was
[00:35:12] super clear that now I still feel like
[00:35:15] I'm very passionate about it of course
[00:35:16] but it's very hard to figure out what am
[00:35:19] I doing with it you know what exactly am
[00:35:21] i doing you know I can give speeches and
[00:35:23] teach people these techniques that's
[00:35:24] great but at some point what am I really
[00:35:28] doing and that's a bit stressful and and
[00:35:31] it's hard to figure it out but with the
[00:35:33] way I always think about it is you know
[00:35:36] I always keep my mind open I always say
[00:35:38] yes to weird new fresh ideas or
[00:35:42] opportunities that come my way kind of
[00:35:43] like you were saying before with you
[00:35:45] know your dad telling you to of course
[00:35:46] go to the Bering Sea and do this this
[00:35:50] thing so I'm always open to that because
[00:35:51] you never know what it is that's gonna
[00:35:54] make you see the clarity and what angle
[00:35:58] see from an angle where it makes sense
[00:36:00] like what you should be doing with the
[00:36:02] skills you have or with the skills you
[00:36:04] have in skills you could learn easier
[00:36:07] than you think you could so I'm kind of
[00:36:10] in one of those modes right now but I'm
[00:36:12] not worried because I think the way that
[00:36:14] I've always approached life is to kind
[00:36:16] of be able to minded and and try these
[00:36:18] things and I know it'll come to me you
[00:36:20] know well one thing did yeah normally I
[00:36:26] don't like to get career advice because
[00:36:29] yeah it's just different for everybody
[00:36:31] but I will have to say the professorial
[00:36:35] needs people like you so I I want to see
[00:36:40] you become a professor of computer
[00:36:42] science because he's so awesome so often
[00:36:45] professors become professors in the
[00:36:49] gone through that pipeline they've never
[00:36:52] experienced anything else and it shapes
[00:36:55] their teaching they feel like they're
[00:37:01] just so one in some sense it can be so
[00:37:05] one-dimensional about how important what
[00:37:08] they're doing actually is and how it
[00:37:10] fits into the greater societal scheme of
[00:37:12] things and to have professors who have
[00:37:15] more real-world experience I think is
[00:37:18] just oh it's not only awesome for
[00:37:21] students it also means that the research
[00:37:23] that you do would have a very different
[00:37:26] flavor and being you can be more that's
[00:37:31] part of what I talk about - in the
[00:37:32] muncha book is that when you switch
[00:37:35] careers you you think oh I'm just as me
[00:37:39] if I think I'm terrible I can't do this
[00:37:41] yeah I'm so far behind everybody else
[00:37:44] but we don't realize is that you bring
[00:37:47] in all these other skills and ideas and
[00:37:50] perceptions and that can make a huge
[00:37:53] difference on your ability to be
[00:37:55] creative and in job yeah Wow very
[00:38:00] insightful stuff we're thinking should I
[00:38:05] go back to school I mean I have my foot
[00:38:06] in the door in the department and
[00:38:08] they're always asking me do you want to
[00:38:09] do your PhD I'm like ha ha it's gonna be
[00:38:11] like four five years of my life but I'm
[00:38:14] very tempted I love I love learning I
[00:38:18] love figuring out stuff you know I don't
[00:38:22] know if everybody had this experience
[00:38:23] but when I was in college I didn't I had
[00:38:26] a long-term girlfriend she was at Boston
[00:38:28] College I was in Miami so I didn't go
[00:38:30] out I didn't drink I didn't live on
[00:38:31] campus I'd I had the opposite
[00:38:33] traditional American experience of
[00:38:36] college where I stayed home and I did my
[00:38:38] homework and that was my like excitement
[00:38:41] especially in physics and math I was
[00:38:43] just spellbound by everything I was
[00:38:46] doing because I didn't know what I
[00:38:48] wanted to do going to the college I
[00:38:49] wanted to be a vet I wanted to be a
[00:38:50] neurosurgeon I don't know and then I
[00:38:54] took a physics course and I aced the
[00:38:56] first test and it wasn't because I I did
[00:39:00] study but it was I studied hard because
[00:39:02] I was just so
[00:39:03] intrigued by it and it was the professor
[00:39:05] that was really what made me interested
[00:39:07] in the course he was a really cool guy
[00:39:10] who just gave examples that like wow
[00:39:13] this this stuff this this science
[00:39:19] describes the world right and I guess
[00:39:21] that was always my deeper interest was
[00:39:24] what I want to learn what the world
[00:39:26] means why are we here my family is not
[00:39:28] very religious so my questions needed
[00:39:31] answering different ways and science and
[00:39:33] physics seem to be the thing that
[00:39:35] satisfied that and I had this experience
[00:39:38] in college where I just was always
[00:39:42] discovering things and and I love that I
[00:39:46] love learning new things that was such a
[00:39:48] nerd but yeah you've got me thinking
[00:39:50] again and maybe go back into education I
[00:39:54] think you'd have a lot to add and five
[00:39:57] years are gonna go by anyway so why not
[00:39:59] have a better structure I was 38 when I
[00:40:03] got my PhD and it really it opened a lot
[00:40:08] of doors so it's not for everybody but
[00:40:14] for someone who is inquisitive and has
[00:40:16] kind of a can-do perspective it can be a
[00:40:22] wonderful wonderful thing yes so when
[00:40:25] does the book come out comes out on
[00:40:28] April 18th 2017 and there will be a look
[00:40:32] at the same time so I'm working on the
[00:40:34] scripts for the MOOC grace we related to
[00:40:36] the book yes yeah as is the book and so
[00:40:43] it's it's all about well it it gives
[00:40:49] concrete and you can even see me talking
[00:40:51] about some of these things or getting a
[00:40:54] different perspective on what's in the
[00:40:58] book so they complement one another and
[00:41:00] it felt fun I just love doing the video
[00:41:03] editing and all of that kind of thing
[00:41:05] and although now I'm running before I
[00:41:09] did I'm ashamed to admit I did
[00:41:11] everything with Sony Vegas Pro and now
[00:41:14] of course industry standard is
[00:41:16] primero so I'm learning that and I'm
[00:41:18] reading this is so much good for you
[00:41:28] that was when I when we did our first
[00:41:29] interview that was one of the things
[00:41:31] that I was so impressed by you by it was
[00:41:32] just how likes on it you are for my mom
[00:41:39] would never know how to use Premiere Pro
[00:41:41] that's insane so high five to you that's
[00:41:45] amazing that you're doing that and your
[00:41:47] videos are great so because I I'm still
[00:41:53] kind of old ladyish in how I do it
[00:41:55] because I'm coming now let's see now
[00:41:57] what is that called an f-stop something
[00:42:00] to do or is that emotion like you know I
[00:42:02] mean I can't remember the terms but I
[00:42:04] sort of know what's going on and so
[00:42:07] sometimes when I talk to people I'm like
[00:42:10] searching for I know what to do but I
[00:42:13] can't remember the term so like
[00:42:14] searching for words so that I sound like
[00:42:16] I'm technically chanting alright a
[00:42:22] couple questions just off the cuff
[00:42:24] what's your favorite place in the entire
[00:42:26] world to ask because I love so many
[00:42:34] places I will have to say that I I love
[00:42:40] Colombia the country Colombia it is when
[00:42:43] it got totally awesome people and with
[00:42:45] this can-do spirit that's amazing I love
[00:42:48] Italy because I love the Italians I
[00:42:54] there's just such a friendly attitude
[00:42:57] that there's so much history there too
[00:43:00] so South Africa is that such a special
[00:43:08] zester's that people are so fantastic I
[00:43:12] mean you know it's sort of a part of it
[00:43:14] is it's sort of like where vibe is most
[00:43:18] recently but but I think I've named some
[00:43:23] of the top ones that hold us special
[00:43:30] something next question have you ever
[00:43:34] met what who's the most famous or
[00:43:37] well-known scientist mathematician
[00:43:40] computer scientists that you've ever met
[00:43:44] Oh for me probably steven pinker and so
[00:43:50] i don't know if people know it but he's
[00:43:52] he's an extraordinary psychologist and
[00:43:56] he's written some fantastic books and
[00:43:58] I've always been in awe of him and I I
[00:44:01] will tell you that when nobody's looking
[00:44:05] he is like just a wonderful human being
[00:44:09] he's he's a best-selling author he's an
[00:44:12] amazing a commissioner and and I wrote
[00:44:17] it kind of out of the blue about ten
[00:44:19] years ago and said what did learn
[00:44:21] playing ball kinda nobody basically and
[00:44:23] and he looked at anything liked it and
[00:44:26] even though it was really controversial
[00:44:28] he he learned it and he's just um you
[00:44:32] know somebody who I mean he didn't there
[00:44:37] was nothing out of any of that and he
[00:44:39] gets inundated as it is and so I just
[00:44:43] all I can say is he's an extent
[00:44:45] wonderful wonderful human being too so
[00:44:50] he he walks the walk okay and then last
[00:44:55] question if you have to give someone a
[00:44:57] book what do you would eat what's your
[00:44:59] go-to like to solve you love that you
[00:45:02] think everybody's got to read this one
[00:45:08] oh man you gotta get geology and
[00:45:12] geography it's like the most awesome
[00:45:14] book but I think let's see I really
[00:45:23] liked Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow
[00:45:27] that's a just a wonderful book I suppose
[00:45:32] that would be one of the very top on my
[00:45:34] list so and then I really like sapiens
[00:45:39] that was a book
[00:45:42] so I thought probably at the problem is
[00:45:46] but hey you know there's a new one
[00:45:48] coming and that's the one that you're
[00:45:50] gonna be writing and that will be the
[00:45:52] one to say I haven't look I wrote it
[00:45:55] already I just gotta get it picked up
[00:45:56] and published there we go there we go
[00:46:00] it will be happening and what are you
[00:46:04] reading right now what's on your bedside
[00:46:05] table oh let's see it's a book called um
[00:46:11] messy and I love it
[00:46:14] it what is the author's and Tim can't
[00:46:17] remember but it is just it is genius
[00:46:21] book it's basically about how this
[00:46:25] pursuit of ordinate orderliness really
[00:46:29] creates problems and kills creativity
[00:46:31] and for example and I he gives us a
[00:46:37] myriad of different ways and he goes
[00:46:39] right into war tactics and basically how
[00:46:43] normals ability to go in and and just
[00:46:46] wreak havoc just makes such a mess of
[00:46:49] everything that nobody knew what was
[00:46:50] going on and he can think faster on his
[00:46:53] feet so he he would create these sort of
[00:46:56] horrible situations that were terrible
[00:46:58] for everybody including his own men but
[00:47:00] then he could had a little much better
[00:47:03] and so and this was this is a
[00:47:07] time-tested sort of thing in war but it
[00:47:12] also you know applies to many different
[00:47:15] you know politics and so forth you go in
[00:47:18] and you spray out chaff and then while
[00:47:21] everybody's all thrown off you can go in
[00:47:24] and and sort of reap the benefits but
[00:47:27] the other one of the other many things
[00:47:30] he talks about is our attempts to
[00:47:32] regulate so we go ahead and we make
[00:47:34] these regulations and then of course
[00:47:35] people figure out ways around the
[00:47:37] regulation so we think we tighten the
[00:47:39] regulations so we can mean to make more
[00:47:41] regulations and so everything for
[00:47:45] example with you know mortgage industry
[00:47:47] and so forth first it was simple then we
[00:47:50] make more complicated you know first
[00:47:52] it's a one-page then it's a
[00:47:54] then it's a 2,000 page now 6,000 page
[00:47:58] and of course the more you regulate the
[00:48:00] more people find ways around the
[00:48:02] regulations and you actually get all
[00:48:05] these unintended consequences because
[00:48:08] you're trying to have all these very
[00:48:09] nice orderly rules that that flip
[00:48:13] everything everybody finds ways around
[00:48:15] them that actually destroy everything
[00:48:18] different regulations were there for so
[00:48:20] anyway this messy is as just a fabulous
[00:48:23] book okay let's check it out alright
[00:48:28] well it's been a good 45 minutes thank
[00:48:30] you so much for answering my question
[00:48:33] somewhere personal ones I just wanted to
[00:48:35] know and others hopefully will help the
[00:48:38] listeners a little bit with their
[00:48:40] studies of learning and they'll check
[00:48:41] out your new look when it comes up make
[00:48:42] sure I can't wait to get my copy so good
[00:48:49] yeah so good luck thanks again for being

[00:00:06] [Music]
[00:00:14] hello everyone and welcome to the mine
[00:00:18] show as usual I'll like to give a little
[00:00:22] shout out to my main sponsor which is
[00:00:24] the extreme memory challenge I highly
[00:00:27] recommend you take the test it's real
[00:00:29] quick fun and easy go to extreme memory
[00:00:33] challenge calm and spend about 5-10
[00:00:35] minutes seeing how good your memory is
[00:00:37] and at the same time you're helping
[00:00:39] science helping dark neuroscience a
[00:00:42] research company help them develop and
[00:00:45] find a drug to help battle cognitive
[00:00:49] disabilities such as Alzheimer's
[00:00:51] Parkinson's Lewy body disease all these
[00:00:55] things that
[00:00:56] kind of debilitated the mind as one ages
[00:00:59] or causes dementia so please help out
[00:01:03] with that that's a huge
[00:01:04] it's very meaningful to me and it allows
[00:01:08] these
[00:01:09] interviews to happen on a weekly
[00:01:12] bi-weekly basis let's dive into it so
[00:01:16] today's guest is Simon Reinhardt who is
[00:01:20] where do I begin in my eyes he is the
[00:01:23] father of speed cards for memorizing
[00:01:26] cards he was the first to really break
[00:01:30] into the 20 slow 20 second barrier and
[00:01:35] you know he hasn't won the World
[00:01:37] Championship which seems like a mistake
[00:01:40] but he's been I think the leading
[00:01:43] driving force in the memory world for
[00:01:47] the last
[00:01:48] I'd say almost ten years maybe just a
[00:01:51] bit less but
[00:01:53] he has got he's he's the one that turned
[00:01:57] memory techniques around I think he's
[00:02:01] inspired a lot of people to kind of push
[00:02:03] the boundaries in the modern day here of
[00:02:06] memory sports and so we're gonna talk
[00:02:09] with him today ask him how he does it a
[00:02:13] little bit of his history and just get
[00:02:15] to know him a bit he's an awesome guy
[00:02:16] good friend of mine he's won the extreme
[00:02:18] memory tournament my little baby two
[00:02:21] times
[00:02:22] and
[00:02:23] he's just an awesome guy Simon's or
[00:02:26] let's go right into it
[00:02:29] welcome to another episode of the mind
[00:02:32] show with me Nelson Dellis and today we
[00:02:34] have the amazing legendary Simone
[00:02:38] Reinhardt from Germany
[00:02:41] two-time extreme memory champion and
[00:02:45] multiple record holder
[00:02:47] German champion many times is it north
[00:02:51] and south and or
[00:02:53] are you have you won the north and not
[00:02:55] the south I don't know exactly what's
[00:02:57] the
[00:02:58] we happy the north and south like for
[00:03:01] people who start competing and if you
[00:03:04] live in the south you only allowed to
[00:03:05] take about myself and there are all
[00:03:07] kinds of like this but I also want the
[00:03:08] total German championship I think three
[00:03:11] times that nice nice ok so what's going
[00:03:15] on how you been what would you been up
[00:03:17] to since the xmt you obviously won this
[00:03:20] year's xmt and what are you doing right
[00:03:23] now
[00:03:25] yeah right now I'm thinking about
[00:03:28] starting my preparation from where you
[00:03:30] Tober tournaments and for the memorial
[00:03:32] in November which is very exciting and
[00:03:35] yes a bit of other stuff like regarding
[00:03:38] the National Association of memory
[00:03:39] you're taking much of my time and which
[00:03:42] has many different things we need to
[00:03:44] clarify so I think apart from that and
[00:03:47] and
[00:03:48] also taking car care of my speech a
[00:03:53] teaching license along I don't have to
[00:03:55] do with the moment nice so tell me a bit
[00:03:58] about the I am the International
[00:04:00] Association of memory what's going on
[00:04:03] why does it exist what are we trying to
[00:04:05] do with that
[00:04:07] basically
[00:04:09] also a bunch of what I will be saying
[00:04:12] now can it can also be found in the
[00:04:14] world memory championships group on
[00:04:15] Facebook which everybody who is watching
[00:04:17] this year is very much invited to be a
[00:04:20] member and to sum it up the I am is
[00:04:25] basically a new start for many people
[00:04:28] who love the sport and who want
[00:04:31] something different
[00:04:32] which is not how things were and in the
[00:04:36] past so
[00:04:38] let's just say that many people were
[00:04:40] unhappy about how things were handled
[00:04:43] regarding arbiter issues rules and many
[00:04:46] other things and it simply became too
[00:04:49] much to bear after the years so I mean
[00:04:54] you're ready to tolerate things for a
[00:04:56] certain amount of time and many people
[00:04:58] did because they thought they didn't
[00:05:01] have an alternative but then they came a
[00:05:03] point last year when things happened
[00:05:05] which
[00:05:06] went against your eyes many people who
[00:05:10] also dear to me and to others and we
[00:05:12] simply decided that's nothing we want to
[00:05:14] have something for our own something
[00:05:17] what try to adjust and we are right now
[00:05:19] in the process of building it and it's
[00:05:23] very fun but also
[00:05:25] yeah yeah I think also two parts to that
[00:05:29] as well as one it's I think it's time to
[00:05:33] take this sport to where it should be
[00:05:36] we're in a modern age now and I think
[00:05:38] for the past what 25 years it's been
[00:05:41] fine but there hasn't been a kind of
[00:05:44] modernization to what it needs to be
[00:05:47] it's very archaic and how it's done
[00:05:50] and also I think there's been a lack of
[00:05:54] focus on the true stars of the memory
[00:05:57] world and that's the athletes and I
[00:05:59] think that's where the the highlights
[00:06:02] and and focus should be right this is
[00:06:05] not to toot our own horn but I mean you
[00:06:08] know there's a as you said I mean the
[00:06:10] way things have been done I think it
[00:06:12] seems like the athletes are second to
[00:06:15] the the competition and the organization
[00:06:18] that runs it which isn't right you know
[00:06:20] yeah
[00:06:23] things that I always found
[00:06:26] quite irritating right in the past when
[00:06:29] we went to war championships it was also
[00:06:32] it was it was always many
[00:06:34] posters of people who were kind of
[00:06:38] yeah doing administration stuff or
[00:06:41] nobody even met and
[00:06:43] who were holding species there and so on
[00:06:47] but there were no posters like of the
[00:06:49] last I'm champion or of the trust pure
[00:06:53] vacuum in the world I mean at the
[00:06:55] biggest tennis tournaments or so or any
[00:06:58] other spot is unusual that
[00:07:00] you do hang posters or the top athletes
[00:07:04] on the ball and everyone can see
[00:07:07] Djokovic they theorize on and completely
[00:07:10] relate to them and this something like
[00:07:13] this at all I mean this is not the main
[00:07:16] thing why we may be I am but is what are
[00:07:20] the many crimes that people had but the
[00:07:23] reaction is always or something like the
[00:07:26] entities yeah they're never like spoken
[00:07:29] often on a direct way it was never like
[00:07:32] you promote the last well champion or
[00:07:34] you promote other people and
[00:07:36] this always seem to be irritating or not
[00:07:38] so good to me so I do like I like that I
[00:07:41] mean all and sweet so yeah I agree but
[00:07:46] exciting it's all exciting and as you
[00:07:48] said it's it's not the easiest thing but
[00:07:50] I think what we all have in common as
[00:07:52] athletes coming together is that we love
[00:07:55] the sport and we want to keep it going
[00:07:56] of course
[00:07:57] so let's let's talk about you for a
[00:08:00] second so you are one of the top memory
[00:08:03] athletes and have been for a while so
[00:08:06] how did you get into this world when did
[00:08:09] you get into this I love I love talking
[00:08:11] about the the historic part of the
[00:08:13] memory world because you're one of the
[00:08:15] ones who's been around for a while and a
[00:08:18] lot of us are new we don't know what
[00:08:19] happened back in the mid-2000s you know
[00:08:22] I talked to Ben he's one of those guys
[00:08:25] who started at the very beginning he has
[00:08:27] some funny stories so what's your what
[00:08:29] was your story getting into memory
[00:08:31] sports
[00:08:31] after me all started in 2005 one of us
[00:08:36] kind of searching on the internet for
[00:08:39] ways to
[00:08:41] memorize better because it was like my
[00:08:45] fourth year at university and I simply
[00:08:48] was not so content with Howard on staff
[00:08:51] and how much I forgot and I came and I
[00:08:56] was not so happy about the way our on
[00:08:59] staff and so on a nice
[00:09:01] I thought okay there must be something
[00:09:02] better and
[00:09:04] so I was searching the web for something
[00:09:09] like memory techniques and so and I
[00:09:11] stumbled upon the German homepage memory
[00:09:14] excel dot d e which is like the
[00:09:18] not-for-profit german memory club for so
[00:09:21] many of us started and
[00:09:23] to be to be very honest I mean I saw
[00:09:26] people writing their about the low kind
[00:09:30] methods and
[00:09:31] memorizing stuff my stories and pictures
[00:09:34] probably totally
[00:09:36] because it was somehow strange to me
[00:09:39] because thought okay what what is this
[00:09:41] stuff and then I was like browsing
[00:09:44] around a bit and then I found something
[00:09:47] that I could somehow relate to it was a
[00:09:49] free training software
[00:09:52] because I'm still suffering when very
[00:09:55] old flesh thing super old but it was a
[00:09:59] structured yeah me and the competition's
[00:10:03] you know we have I memorized names and
[00:10:04] numbers of stuff like this and this was
[00:10:06] checked the same but it had like from
[00:10:09] level 1 to level 10 so when you were a
[00:10:11] super beginner you would like sat in
[00:10:13] level 1 and you would like memorize five
[00:10:16] names at five faces with first and last
[00:10:19] name and if you had all of those correct
[00:10:21] you would advance information and the
[00:10:23] thing would automatically saved so you
[00:10:25] would also save all of your progress
[00:10:26] which is cool yeah and
[00:10:28] this kind of piqued my interest because
[00:10:31] I wanted to get better and better and I
[00:10:33] always thought I had quite a good memory
[00:10:34] but I thought of being honored Tesla
[00:10:36] thing but I didn't want to use any kind
[00:10:39] of locations or something like this
[00:10:42] because funky communities so ago yeah
[00:10:45] and then I came to a point where I had
[00:10:47] to use yeah like a certain level and I
[00:10:50] didn't get any better and then you were
[00:10:53] so many that was kind of an eye-opening
[00:10:54] moment because it simply worked yeah and
[00:10:58] then so that was 2005 and then when was
[00:11:01] your first memory championship that you
[00:11:04] could be today about two months later
[00:11:08] super super close because it was like
[00:11:11] the South German championship yeah
[00:11:15] you know from where I was living like
[00:11:18] only a two-hour train ride or so and
[00:11:20] okay
[00:11:23] something also gave him kind of a hint
[00:11:25] if you had like always like an average
[00:11:28] from the seven disciplines that you are
[00:11:30] practicing barons like if you are having
[00:11:33] discipline you learned that the senior
[00:11:34] in average of 2.0 and when you a 5.0 it
[00:11:38] kind of gave him I said now you are
[00:11:39] ready to go to every conference
[00:11:43] thank you very much
[00:11:46] and it was super nice I mean I met some
[00:11:49] people there that I still know today I
[00:11:51] mean Florian they need yes yeah and I'm
[00:11:56] I said like for the first time honest
[00:11:57] because some of the things we were
[00:12:00] talking about and he does Washington pin
[00:12:03] smile cell is not act anymore and many
[00:12:07] many other people who
[00:12:08] stop computer and so it was like a very
[00:12:11] exciting moment and
[00:12:14] yeah and from that time on I said okay
[00:12:17] that's a very nice community and it's
[00:12:19] not like it chess is so sorry to to all
[00:12:22] the chess players yeah but I wanted some
[00:12:25] chestnuts live tournaments what to do I
[00:12:28] didn't really like it because there are
[00:12:30] some real cycles there sorry sorry it's
[00:12:34] so peaceful and nice and nobody was like
[00:12:38] envious or there was some aggression and
[00:12:41] I really liked it
[00:12:43] and I don't know that was another form
[00:12:45] the Rainbows forum very also posted of
[00:12:48] the advance so I don't people for the
[00:12:51] first time but many of those who I know
[00:12:53] so today like Boris Conrad or you -
[00:12:57] Madeline my trust as people still in
[00:12:59] front of me in the rankings of memories
[00:13:01] our trading software click ok I wanted
[00:13:04] to get anything for that yeah
[00:13:06] - guy
[00:13:09] that's cool and
[00:13:11] so then I know you you have I believe
[00:13:17] you still have some records
[00:13:19] that are current that you had some
[00:13:23] obviously along the way one of the big
[00:13:25] ones was that you
[00:13:28] Ben's record of speed cards right I
[00:13:30] think at the time it was just under 25
[00:13:32] seconds is that right I think
[00:13:35] yeah it was twenty four point seven five
[00:13:38] nine seven right and then you did you
[00:13:41] hit 24 first something or was it 22 no I
[00:13:45] did it 36 so it was I was slower I think
[00:13:49] I'm saying here and
[00:13:50] then in 2010 eighty two twenty one point
[00:13:54] nine year old yeah and there was I might
[00:13:59] have been there or no I did when you did
[00:14:02] 21 point one nine yeah yeah
[00:14:06] yeah yeah I think one year later and but
[00:14:11] thankfully salt German championship and
[00:14:13] it was somehow cool I don't know I
[00:14:15] hadn't I had practiced this for quite
[00:14:18] some time and then you wake with two
[00:14:20] times closer to 20 seconds and 21
[00:14:23] seconds also wasn't like something that
[00:14:24] was completely new and yeah all of that
[00:14:29] came you came together and I mean there
[00:14:31] was a video made from that and I think
[00:14:34] it is really the most viewers of all my
[00:14:36] videos which is on YouTube oriented it
[00:14:39] back them and I can still recall that I
[00:14:42] was really I had one of the images
[00:14:45] because to explain which I make from
[00:14:48] from two cars I make one
[00:14:51] wish so I had all the images on part
[00:14:54] from two cars left and both of the cat
[00:14:58] combinations somehow made sense one more
[00:15:00] thing the other one was another kind of
[00:15:03] animal the total total makeup business
[00:15:05] yeah
[00:15:07] it's on this some empty chance you have
[00:15:10] to guess yeah I really had myself into
[00:15:14] it because sometimes you can really get
[00:15:15] some kind of additional hints if you
[00:15:17] really try to remember sure exactly
[00:15:20] listen when he like put the image there
[00:15:22] so was it like this or this or how how
[00:15:24] does it feel and I think I was like
[00:15:27] struggling tell me last 20 seconds or so
[00:15:30] and then I said no that must be it put
[00:15:34] the two cars together and I still had
[00:15:35] some stacks there and my 32 cars like
[00:15:38] your first X and I put two guys here
[00:15:42] insects thanks to him I think I turn
[00:15:45] them around like in the last five
[00:15:46] seconds yeah yeah and the link to the
[00:15:49] video it's a fun video to watch
[00:15:53] that so those last two cards did you you
[00:15:57] felt like you have it or was it somewhat
[00:15:59] part of a guess I was quite confident
[00:16:02] back to segment
[00:16:04] right yeah cuz I've had times where I
[00:16:07] have you know a couple cards left and
[00:16:09] I'm not quite sure but you know I have a
[00:16:12] feeling like a gut feeling that it was
[00:16:14] this but you spend like two three
[00:16:17] minutes thinking about it trying to put
[00:16:18] yourself there and you can almost
[00:16:19] convince yourself out of it you know
[00:16:22] that the other one was 100% it and then
[00:16:25] you flip it the other way around I've
[00:16:27] switched you know so like between the
[00:16:30] the order three or four times and then
[00:16:32] ultimately most of the time my gut
[00:16:35] feeling at first is usually the right
[00:16:37] one but sometimes you if you just play
[00:16:39] with your hand you know
[00:16:41] I can I can only tell people if you are
[00:16:47] in doubt about the sequence of something
[00:16:50] be it like in numbers or cards or
[00:16:52] anything and you had a good feeling when
[00:16:55] you wrote it down like the first time
[00:16:57] and then comes at the end of the vehicle
[00:16:59] phase and you have like 20 seconds left
[00:17:02] or so and then you get the sudden
[00:17:04] inspiration but it was
[00:17:06] do not transpiration and it's really my
[00:17:10] experience that the eight or nine out of
[00:17:12] ten times it is wrong to change in the
[00:17:14] last you know it's true always because
[00:17:17] your memory really is kind of trying to
[00:17:20] play tricks on you yeah I I heard this
[00:17:23] phrase the other day this quote that
[00:17:26] goes change your mind lose your mind so
[00:17:30] when you change your mind you start to
[00:17:32] like lose your mind a bit because you're
[00:17:34] suddenly like well should I have done
[00:17:36] that what's the right thing so you
[00:17:38] always have to kind of go with your your
[00:17:39] gut instinct you know especially when it
[00:17:41] comes to memory because usually that's
[00:17:43] right it's usually right it's better
[00:17:44] than you honestly think it is
[00:17:47] so so after that
[00:17:50] what was it like being someone then your
[00:17:53] name the speed cards guru what was that
[00:17:57] like you know at that time
[00:18:00] to be the fastest car to memorizer in
[00:18:04] the world so pretty cool
[00:18:07] it's a nice time to think back to you
[00:18:10] but somehow nice of it in the past no
[00:18:13] after recent developments but
[00:18:16] it's simply always very natural for me
[00:18:21] to like memorize cards because I
[00:18:25] very very often I'm not the donee store
[00:18:27] the images like on the locations but but
[00:18:30] also losses of the cards and the self so
[00:18:33] which it also helped me to get them in
[00:18:36] the right sequence and
[00:18:38] yeah I think it was very happy because
[00:18:41] it was one of the disciplines that I
[00:18:43] liked best and which I also tried and
[00:18:45] trained the most and
[00:18:48] yeah if I can challenge my myself again
[00:18:51] I mean I was happy that people liked the
[00:18:53] video and in fact that it was such a
[00:18:54] nice video and I simply try to improve
[00:18:56] more ah yeah and so that's not all
[00:18:59] you're good at obviously
[00:19:01] one of your other some of your other
[00:19:03] best ones are you're amazing at names
[00:19:06] and you're amazing at words so one of
[00:19:08] the records that you have I'm super
[00:19:11] jealous of and would love to be in a
[00:19:12] position to aim for it but you have
[00:19:15] memorized 300 words in 15 minutes so
[00:19:19] that's one of the events is you get 15
[00:19:20] minutes to memorize as many words as
[00:19:22] possible
[00:19:23] and 300 that's pretty darn good what's
[00:19:27] the second-best after that do you know
[00:19:30] that's ever been done not by you maybe
[00:19:33] 280 no I had to 289 at last year's World
[00:19:38] Championship I'm not sure if that's has
[00:19:41] done more than 289 I'm not sure it
[00:19:45] forested at a certain time up to 96 or
[00:19:49] so or to 86 but I think the 289 might
[00:19:53] even be the second-best okay that's
[00:19:55] pretty good yeah I think I tried I don't
[00:19:59] know what I got two last year maybe
[00:20:03] 276
[00:20:05] and then I got like a one wrong or
[00:20:08] something or yeah - I don't know one
[00:20:10] wrong and one completely wrong in like
[00:20:12] one small error
[00:20:14] but anyways tell me about the time you
[00:20:17] got 300 right
[00:20:19] you've told me the story before but I
[00:20:21] just for the listeners that I like
[00:20:22] hearing it let me just but yet my muscle
[00:20:26] oh
[00:20:27] yeah it's hot there in where you're in
[00:20:30] Munich right
[00:20:31] yeah so I need some water
[00:20:35] so that I can continue my answer to
[00:20:38] speech
[00:20:40] it was when I when I
[00:20:44] and it was a German championship and I
[00:20:48] didn't have such a good tournament I
[00:20:50] don't know I slept really badly before I
[00:20:52] played only two hours
[00:20:54] and I don't know usually I see very well
[00:20:58] so it's probably kind of a freak back
[00:21:02] night or so and I did have very bad
[00:21:06] results and things before so I really
[00:21:08] wanted to come for some good stuff in
[00:21:10] the second day and the same phenomena
[00:21:13] also may be funded for spoken a boost
[00:21:15] which was not what I thought back then
[00:21:16] and and I really try to go for not for
[00:21:20] something super risky it works but but
[00:21:21] really not to not to hold myself back
[00:21:24] and
[00:21:25] yeah and I don't know how I exactly did
[00:21:28] it so with the repetitions but they
[00:21:31] looked at me and I think total four
[00:21:34] times and I'm gonna need more and I
[00:21:37] think I wrote down 308 okay and
[00:21:41] yeah
[00:21:42] it seems I had some spelling errors but
[00:21:47] I rather think that some of the words
[00:21:48] among the last eight was spelled wrong
[00:21:51] on the memo sheet it was a bit strange
[00:21:53] like some
[00:21:55] percent is very wrong and I think it
[00:21:58] also said
[00:21:59] intentionally wrong but somehow I did
[00:22:03] check anymore but they gave me 300 and
[00:22:07] it was really cool to kind of break this
[00:22:09] it's a cool barrier with a 3 in front of
[00:22:13] the your number is good after you've
[00:22:15] been saying only to hundreds and
[00:22:17] something you know
[00:22:18] that's a tricky one because for me yeah
[00:22:21] I mean obviously sometimes I've made
[00:22:23] mistakes where I just put the wrong word
[00:22:24] but I think a lot of my mistakes are
[00:22:26] just spelling mistakes and it's often
[00:22:29] the words that I
[00:22:30] you know commonly misspelled and then I
[00:22:33] second-guess myself is that an ER or an
[00:22:36] O R at the end I don't know but you know
[00:22:39] if I have to tell you the image it would
[00:22:41] be correct it's just the spelling
[00:22:43] sometimes right that gets those points
[00:22:45] off
[00:22:47] yeah so
[00:22:50] let's talk a bit about the I
[00:22:54] don't know if it's a touchy subject I'm
[00:22:56] I think you're one of the top guys and
[00:22:58] you've killed it at the xmt but what's
[00:23:02] it been like being right there in the
[00:23:07] running for winning the World
[00:23:08] Championships many times and it just
[00:23:11] hasn't you haven't been able to grasp it
[00:23:15] whether it was you Honus winning by just
[00:23:17] a few points or
[00:23:20] you know just being so close and not
[00:23:22] getting it what's that been like there
[00:23:25] well actually I painted those very
[00:23:29] motivation so I really have the black
[00:23:34] that my
[00:23:36] yeah that my own are in a stance what's
[00:23:39] tournaments is like I tried to be my
[00:23:42] best and if it doesn't work out well
[00:23:45] then half at least fought valiantly so
[00:23:48] and I mean in my watch championships and
[00:23:52] so now I think it was two times seconds
[00:23:56] late and three times third
[00:24:00] so my first time when I became second
[00:24:03] about 12 it was really close it was I
[00:24:07] mean - I mean we're really close under
[00:24:10] the speed cards was like 20 points in
[00:24:12] front so and then you guys are now at 24
[00:24:15] so or 23 and
[00:24:19] he would agree with something something
[00:24:21] has to and he kind of made with like 60
[00:24:25] points or so but it was such a nice
[00:24:27] friend but basically I
[00:24:30] had my cars in the second round was like
[00:24:33] 27 seconds and if he hadn't made it then
[00:24:36] I just won but it wasn't clear because
[00:24:39] my table was chemistry for days so I
[00:24:41] went over there and they were like
[00:24:42] councilor the cards and I simply thought
[00:24:44] okay if he now has this yet like 41
[00:24:47] seconds and he has some granted because
[00:24:49] he had another competition before and I
[00:24:51] was super happy and I think this is
[00:24:53] something that really happened that I am
[00:24:56] not like kind of eaten up by other
[00:24:58] people winning us at like this but I can
[00:25:00] simply say if someone beats me and I can
[00:25:04] say that I have given my my own the
[00:25:07] competition then they have something
[00:25:10] beyond it and also does not diminish
[00:25:12] myself
[00:25:13] so I and I'm I think the best chance
[00:25:18] that I that I had was I guess in 2014
[00:25:22] until now and where I had a great year
[00:25:25] where I only the X and T and I think it
[00:25:27] was like riding undefeated and a lot of
[00:25:30] tournaments or so I think I am also
[00:25:33] because you're honest made kind of a
[00:25:35] break that year and I
[00:25:38] was like had my internal calculations
[00:25:41] about was Jonas I thought could do and
[00:25:45] so because till then it was always like
[00:25:48] and a pattern meant that he was here yes
[00:25:50] I the results that we won championships
[00:25:53] and was not so good in our tournaments
[00:25:55] and not so good of course I don't mean
[00:25:57] bad at something even prepared to his
[00:25:59] best performances of I said them in the
[00:26:02] washing dishes and I thought he might be
[00:26:06] with his scores that I expected he would
[00:26:09] be yet I don't know seven thousand seven
[00:26:11] hundred or 7800 and I was like Amy for
[00:26:16] Refugees set of nine or so cost that I
[00:26:20] at least what would happen would it be
[00:26:23] even more I had a slight lead before
[00:26:26] speed cast something like this maybe he
[00:26:28] said I
[00:26:30] think there are also made a small
[00:26:32] mistake that I took things a bit to Y
[00:26:35] which is safety for places I could be
[00:26:38] sixty million cars I
[00:26:40] didn't really go for like 26:xx
[00:26:44] Oh and then he suddenly had like 36 fish
[00:26:47] and surprisingly this because I think he
[00:26:51] hadn't didn't care cause until then he
[00:26:53] also had 106 days which was a bit higher
[00:26:56] than I expected and
[00:26:59] then wearing the speed cuts came
[00:27:02] I would have needed whatever knife and
[00:27:06] he goes I think 20 1.33 that would take
[00:27:11] time yeah and
[00:27:15] yeah it didn't work out so
[00:27:18] this is something where I think to
[00:27:21] myself I it wasn't I wasn't anything
[00:27:24] afterwards or so but I said learn from
[00:27:27] things that having a better preparation
[00:27:29] that can be paid off because I was not
[00:27:32] at my fullest because I didn't take too
[00:27:35] too easily definitely not but I suddenly
[00:27:37] was a bit too generous in my own
[00:27:39] calculation what my opponent could do
[00:27:40] I'd recently was yeah
[00:27:45] then I expected so
[00:27:47] but it was fantastic accomplished by him
[00:27:51] I think it's still
[00:27:53] 7400 points to the day or something like
[00:27:57] this so he wasn't as best for me so I
[00:28:00] loved it how much did he win by what was
[00:28:04] the difference between you and I yeah
[00:28:08] because he had a speaker scoring I did
[00:28:11] not it was like hollow points or so okay
[00:28:14] but that's cuz you tried your fastest to
[00:28:16] get the cards right yeah so it's not so
[00:28:20] I like try it like eighteen point seven
[00:28:22] two what I couldn't put it back together
[00:28:24] so and I mean if I would have made a
[00:28:28] safe house for so like thirty seconds or
[00:28:31] so or twenty okay
[00:28:34] hazel yeah nice and so since you've
[00:28:39] competed since 2005 what has been your
[00:28:42] in all competitions in memory sports
[00:28:45] what has been your most memorable moment
[00:28:47] like your happiest coolest moment I
[00:28:50] don't know
[00:28:52] pinpoint it
[00:28:54] yeah
[00:28:56] yeah like
[00:28:58] I think I could pick one like my my 3
[00:29:01] most favorite moments sir I would say it
[00:29:06] was like breaking the speed comes
[00:29:08] records again in 2011 and by that
[00:29:11] winning would be German championship in
[00:29:13] front of Yamato
[00:29:15] 1 and my 2x of treatments
[00:29:20] because I think me xmt I mean it also
[00:29:24] has become so much stronger in the last
[00:29:26] year since
[00:29:28] 2014
[00:29:29] really was a wonderful win but him I
[00:29:32] thought my most favorite moment of those
[00:29:34] three is my expertise in this year yeah
[00:29:37] because a strong yield and it's so
[00:29:39] strong competitor knows crazy the levels
[00:29:42] were higher
[00:29:44] definitely and obviously I'm obvious
[00:29:47] idea created it but the cool thing about
[00:29:50] winning that is like you lasted till the
[00:29:54] end you know it's like a Last Man
[00:29:55] Standing type of thing so if you look at
[00:29:58] all the stuff you had to win to get
[00:30:00] there it's crazy right like that's a
[00:30:02] hard thing to do whereas the World
[00:30:04] Championships you know you have 10
[00:30:06] disciplines and you're there your own
[00:30:09] desk in your own head you can treat that
[00:30:12] however you want here you're facing
[00:30:14] someone you don't know
[00:30:16] how many matches you're gonna place you
[00:30:18] don't know the play that you're gonna
[00:30:20] you don't know so I think it's a lot
[00:30:23] more of a mindfuck than the world
[00:30:26] champion so it really shows that you
[00:30:29] have a strong mind so I'm very impressed
[00:30:32] with it and to win it twice yet I mean
[00:30:34] the first year obviously we didn't know
[00:30:36] what it was like but it's still
[00:30:37] impressive but a two-time winner and
[00:30:39] that I think is like pretty good I
[00:30:41] remember thinking I told this to Brad
[00:30:43] who helps me run the ex-ante when you
[00:30:47] were going up against
[00:30:48] [Music]
[00:30:51] Bujji I
[00:30:52] was thinking you know the xmt is it good
[00:30:57] to have a competition that we've created
[00:30:59] where it's a different winner every
[00:31:01] competition like does that show that
[00:31:04] it's a good competition like the way
[00:31:06] it's designed or is it good to have
[00:31:09] multiple winners sometimes or is that
[00:31:11] bad is it bad if you have the same
[00:31:14] winners every time
[00:31:15] so
[00:31:17] ultimately I don't have the answer to
[00:31:19] that I think it's fine you know
[00:31:22] ultimately it's the competitors that
[00:31:25] they win they win they're the best
[00:31:27] they're the best but um yeah I'm having
[00:31:29] you one and you clearly deserve to win
[00:31:32] it wasn't like
[00:31:33] we gave it away you mopped the floor
[00:31:36] with
[00:31:37] pooja at the end there so that's good
[00:31:42] yeah I mean for me it definitely was
[00:31:46] preferable that there was
[00:31:49] not a new winner so I mean this is
[00:31:52] responsible so many key events I was
[00:31:55] preparing if we had perhaps a two-time
[00:31:57] speaker this year but I think I have to
[00:32:01] technically object against the line
[00:32:03] mounted or with anyone saw the final I
[00:32:06] mean the score was five oh but it is
[00:32:10] still felt very close I mean
[00:32:15] it was bad luck for him that he has
[00:32:18] inherited condition at the first
[00:32:20] surprise event
[00:32:22] also the second surprise event was quite
[00:32:24] close I think it was only three against
[00:32:26] two for from me in his second surprise
[00:32:28] event the mini surprise no dimensions
[00:32:31] and things okay perhaps one of the
[00:32:35] points were rather clear but it was
[00:32:38] simply a close match and I was happy
[00:32:40] after every every point and he had a
[00:32:43] great final I think he definitely for
[00:32:46] himself perhaps was not happy about how
[00:32:50] it went but he would definitely feel as
[00:32:53] he's a very strong competitor and he
[00:32:56] will be the next issue
[00:32:59] everyone is like expecting him to be an
[00:33:02] adhesive strong this year
[00:33:04] now he was very strong competitor and I
[00:33:07] was like I think he's gonna win not not
[00:33:10] to put anything against I'm about I
[00:33:11] actually thought he was gonna win but
[00:33:13] you were you put on a fantastic
[00:33:15] performance to win so congratulations
[00:33:19] so before we kind of close this off I'd
[00:33:22] love to know a little bit about your
[00:33:24] systems specific because a lot of people
[00:33:27] would love to know that especially for
[00:33:29] cards and numbers
[00:33:31] so for cards you mentioned you have a to
[00:33:33] card system and
[00:33:35] how does it work exactly do you is it
[00:33:38] like a been system or it's something
[00:33:40] else what is it and I think it's
[00:33:43] different from the Avensis
[00:33:45] and what I what I'm doing is I see each
[00:33:51] card as a combination of a consonant and
[00:33:56] a vowel so the value of the card always
[00:34:00] becomes a consonant like like I do in my
[00:34:04] normal number systems so for people who
[00:34:06] are not so much memory storage just like
[00:34:08] in your number systems for instance you
[00:34:11] would use letters for numbers and years
[00:34:14] letter n for the number two and that's a
[00:34:17] Hammurabi number three because they look
[00:34:19] similar and so on and so on and that's
[00:34:21] what I'm often doing with the value of
[00:34:22] the card and I'm taking a vowel for the
[00:34:25] suit of the card so the this
[00:34:31] completely how I felt it would make the
[00:34:33] most sense like how does an a because I
[00:34:36] know is such an open and bright sound or
[00:34:39] so because a is like and the others like
[00:34:43] like the two darker ones alike oh and I
[00:34:47] and so on so it is simply each each card
[00:34:50] you can say it's a retinal syllable at
[00:34:52] points of these seven of Hearts it's
[00:34:54] like in seven is an L and be hardest an
[00:34:57] ace or it will always be this little
[00:34:59] platform and
[00:35:01] and
[00:35:03] then you can
[00:35:07] and then you combine this with a number
[00:35:09] syllable let's say is take an example if
[00:35:12] my second card would be like a two of
[00:35:15] diamonds this would be n and II so I
[00:35:19] would have but I would like that's a
[00:35:22] instantly when I see the cards that were
[00:35:24] to read the letters L a and and II know
[00:35:29] if I would be an English speaker it
[00:35:31] would be like Lane and I would be memory
[00:35:34] lane okay so um I would say every every
[00:35:38] two cards are at least to a little bored
[00:35:40] or more addressed opposed to each other
[00:35:43] it was I mean this works very very good
[00:35:44] for me because I can basically read the
[00:35:47] cascading yeah you're just reading a
[00:35:50] book coming up with a few pictures
[00:35:53] really quickly yeah yeah and so a little
[00:35:56] la and II what would that be in German
[00:35:58] what do you have for that one actually
[00:36:03] question I think I would perhaps even be
[00:36:06] laying because I
[00:36:08] mixed my own systems a bit so I have
[00:36:11] many many German words of course but for
[00:36:14] the not so common combinations for
[00:36:15] instance I think that there isn't well
[00:36:18] fitting German word for this I also took
[00:36:20] foreign words so I think it would
[00:36:23] perhaps even the name and for instance
[00:36:25] to but if it would have been in let's
[00:36:28] say the queen of diamonds just second
[00:36:30] cards you will have L a PE which fits
[00:36:35] nicely to be German word laughing for
[00:36:38] something some kind of towel or so soft
[00:36:42] which you modification okay so that was
[00:36:46] my next question is so Lane is a word
[00:36:48] what if you got something that wasn't
[00:36:51] necessarily worried like what if it was
[00:36:52] la
[00:36:55] le8 what is that so I guess some of them
[00:36:58] you kind of stretch out into something
[00:37:00] that it would sound like if it was a
[00:37:03] longer word or if it sounds like
[00:37:04] something else right yeah so I mean this
[00:37:08] just
[00:37:09] not so hard actually to find words for
[00:37:13] those I mean it's a 2600 combinations
[00:37:16] but they are also surprisingly many
[00:37:18] words that fit well into this two
[00:37:19] syllable system so I think I have found
[00:37:23] something for every combination
[00:37:24] sometimes you have to search a bit
[00:37:26] longer but as you mentioned you find
[00:37:28] something and you ask yourself why
[00:37:29] didn't I think it's all you yeah and as
[00:37:33] I said if I don't find anything man I
[00:37:34] kind of have something in another
[00:37:37] language which I speak rather well like
[00:37:39] like English or civil or
[00:37:42] like to speak Italian so I think about
[00:37:44] five to ten percent or so of my system I
[00:37:46] like an English on one or two percent
[00:37:48] girls are like in Italian words so you
[00:37:51] really find something we just have to
[00:37:52] look for it and if you don't something
[00:37:55] if you really don't find something then
[00:37:56] you can still look for a word which
[00:37:59] sounds similar and
[00:38:02] it doesn't have to be the exact well as
[00:38:05] long as you know that it is like
[00:38:07] something similar it's very often in my
[00:38:10] pajamas oh okay and then so you have so
[00:38:14] you have two cars you come up with a
[00:38:16] word two syllable word then are you
[00:38:19] placing just that one word in each
[00:38:21] location are you combining a few words
[00:38:25] no with cards and I always put one image
[00:38:29] on one location I'm thinking about
[00:38:32] perhaps changing this for the card
[00:38:34] marathons but when we put these cards
[00:38:36] putting more than one into one location
[00:38:38] someone doesn't really work for me
[00:38:40] because it means we clear and the image
[00:38:43] really needs to have a strong connection
[00:38:45] to the location this was a great dancer
[00:38:49] you're doing 26 different images in it
[00:38:52] for that deck got it okay very cool and
[00:38:55] then what's in training
[00:38:57] what is your fastest time
[00:39:00] yeah with
[00:39:03] with Riaan cards somebody my fastest
[00:39:07] time where I really put up with cats
[00:39:09] together was like eighteen point nine
[00:39:11] seven
[00:39:13] time ago but recently like like this
[00:39:16] year I was also trained like on speed
[00:39:18] ability to see what skills and I could
[00:39:21] seven three-point-four together it was
[00:39:24] it was just a bit bad because I wasn't
[00:39:27] quite sure whether I'd seen some of the
[00:39:30] cards before memorization or not I mean
[00:39:32] if she would like shovel it yourself
[00:39:34] that's as far as in the forest so if I
[00:39:37] would be really really strict I wouldn't
[00:39:39] count this but I have a rather keen
[00:39:42] conscience that it was okay and
[00:39:44] definitely also do fossilised that's
[00:39:47] pretty good and do you think there's
[00:39:49] room for improvement
[00:39:50] like
[00:39:51] do you think you can still get faster
[00:39:53] with what you have or do you think you'd
[00:39:55] have to make a change to get faster what
[00:39:58] do you think it would take to get
[00:40:00] consistent under 20 seconds say
[00:40:04] yeah the interesting thing is says I
[00:40:09] what I have to not done there would be
[00:40:11] last year's even if it's a little
[00:40:13] strange just really tried to get to me
[00:40:16] ultimately fast car times on my train
[00:40:19] most probably because for a long time
[00:40:22] that wasn't really someone who was
[00:40:25] always threatening my fastest times so I
[00:40:28] only this year started to really go for
[00:40:31] and say times which are much thought of
[00:40:34] my own cars comfort zone and
[00:40:37] as you see results very quickly so I
[00:40:42] just had to clean it up so I think what
[00:40:45] I might my contact it would be to each
[00:40:47] others to first try how consistent
[00:40:50] Kennedy when I really read say make
[00:40:52] twenty or mondex day with super fast
[00:40:55] times and simply see if I can see some
[00:40:58] kind of improvement and
[00:41:00] if I get your bed level and it doesn't
[00:41:04] get faster and then say I
[00:41:06] notice or realize that I can get to
[00:41:09] Malik's level even if I was very much
[00:41:12] into getting out of my comfort zone then
[00:41:14] I would have to think about making a new
[00:41:16] system but until then I mean I wouldn't
[00:41:20] say confident but I believe in myself
[00:41:22] that they are still much too important
[00:41:24] to learn that know in nineteen nineteen
[00:41:27] point four seventy possible which but
[00:41:31] his own best science of course are also
[00:41:33] extremely strong so I simply like to
[00:41:36] have a good shot at attacking momentary
[00:41:39] car slowed record of nineteen point four
[00:41:42] one listen earring perhaps laziness
[00:41:44] before he grace is on again and give him
[00:41:47] a good fight lighting the next time this
[00:41:49] would be cool and then let's see Doug
[00:41:50] you Dan yeah nice I hope you get a man
[00:41:54] it's it's fun to watch the sport
[00:41:57] progress either way you know I mean
[00:42:00] that's how it works right if somebody
[00:42:01] breaks the record and then you want to
[00:42:03] back so you try something new or you
[00:42:05] push yourself in different ways and it
[00:42:07] goes back and forth and ultimately
[00:42:08] you're advancing the sport you know
[00:42:11] yeah yeah and it was just one one thing
[00:42:15] it was also really cool to
[00:42:18] having been a witness to this record
[00:42:22] because I mean I was like they're on the
[00:42:24] same tournament when an ex-pro given you
[00:42:26] the record which protecting standing
[00:42:29] like for six years so if you counted
[00:42:31] first I was broken from 2010 and
[00:42:34] is simply was was happy that I could be
[00:42:37] am a part of this and to
[00:42:39] see him breaking it into two hits and
[00:42:43] also seeing him like breaking it which
[00:42:45] such a time when he could also have such
[00:42:50] a great total scoring was really cool
[00:42:53] because I am simply happy about people
[00:42:55] having great performances this really is
[00:42:59] something that gives me a kick to to see
[00:43:01] people perform well and to give their
[00:43:03] all and this also motivates me yeah nice
[00:43:06] and then let's jump to two numbers for a
[00:43:09] little bit what's what's the process
[00:43:11] there I
[00:43:12] think you told me once you do four digit
[00:43:15] chunks yeah
[00:43:18] what I want to do is number
[00:43:23] four digit number system
[00:43:25] so I mean a real traditional system and
[00:43:28] it's think it is only possible because I
[00:43:32] had a certain predation system before so
[00:43:36] very similar to what I did ID cards I
[00:43:39] had with the
[00:43:41] numbers with my Fuji system I had
[00:43:44] consonant vowel consonant okay so
[00:43:49] this is very similar or you know
[00:43:52] basically when a bandit first so I
[00:43:53] didn't invent this but I kind of adapted
[00:43:56] it to you German language so I use
[00:43:58] completely other songs for it
[00:44:01] but it works very well so I have um the
[00:44:05] hi John main vowel space from metal and
[00:44:09] numbers of my second issued by with long
[00:44:12] and short but strokes very well because
[00:44:14] long and short vowels or for me these
[00:44:16] are very clearly differentiate in in
[00:44:19] German language yeah I mean it's very
[00:44:22] very very different if you say every
[00:44:25] word lamb which means like Lane or you
[00:44:30] know lambda which means like land which
[00:44:32] is shortened so I got this and my
[00:44:35] punishes service against headshots and
[00:44:39] then do you do similar
[00:44:41] to cards of you 142 chunk per location
[00:44:44] or do you group a few we cannabis I even
[00:44:48] feel that I can only handle one word in
[00:44:52] one location which was causing 10,000
[00:44:54] images yeah and we're putting more than
[00:44:57] one word in one location it wouldn't be
[00:45:00] bad here anymore okay
[00:45:02] yeah so you need a lot of because you do
[00:45:05] a lot of numbers close to 400 it's not
[00:45:09] over 400 so you need a lot of
[00:45:12] long locations long journeys or any long
[00:45:16] memory policies okay how many do you
[00:45:18] have for numbers for example I don't
[00:45:22] take like take a Johnny site is non bus
[00:45:25] and everything so what yeah so they
[00:45:28] usually work well so I have I think
[00:45:31] about 3,000 and told him that it was
[00:45:33] competitions and
[00:45:36] yeah I
[00:45:38] think I missed them all the time okay
[00:45:41] that's interesting I usually yeah a lot
[00:45:44] of people usually have specific ones
[00:45:46] that they use for specific things yeah
[00:45:48] that's good that's a good tool how
[00:45:50] probably especially for something like
[00:45:52] xmt as well
[00:45:54] yeah it is and it also makes it I mean I
[00:45:57] didn't pack enough locations in the past
[00:46:00] so sometimes even with my first World
[00:46:03] Championships with my costume I had to
[00:46:05] reuse like locations on the second day
[00:46:08] or so on Friday and you get a good feel
[00:46:10] which disciplines work together in that
[00:46:13] way so you cannot bind binary numbers
[00:46:15] because it's the same images but like
[00:46:18] using numbers and gloves it's no problem
[00:46:19] at all because you have very often
[00:46:22] different things there yeah yeah
[00:46:25] well that's great thank you so much for
[00:46:28] taking the time to answer some of those
[00:46:30] questions I'm sure a lot of people want
[00:46:32] to hear this and learn about how you do
[00:46:35] things and things have to say so thank
[00:46:38] you so much for being on this show and I
[00:46:40] guess I'll see you in Vegas in about two
[00:46:44] months from now yeah absolutely
[00:46:47] I'll be good at Memorial which is
[00:46:49] another memory competition that happens
[00:46:51] they're great two years four years wait
[00:46:54] for you like we're gonna get there you
[00:46:57] guys yeah like a memory like that all
[00:47:00] right Simon take care I will see you
[00:47:02] soon and good luck with the heat over
[00:47:04] there and
[00:47:06] Germany oh
[00:47:08] and thank you very much for having me
[00:47:11] and I don't like the inside too much
[00:47:14] but I have to really apologize
[00:47:19] show but I hope it was okay because
[00:47:23] thank you
[00:47:27] [Music]
[00:47:32] [Music]
[00:47:42] you


=== Nelson Dellis' MIND SHOW - How I Memorized 10,000 Digits Of Pi ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEmpmmFVBls

[00:00:06] [Music]
[00:00:15] welcome to another episode of the mine
[00:00:18] show with me your host Nelson Dellis for
[00:00:22] time USA memory champion and grandmaster
[00:00:25] of memory and
[00:00:26] today we are gonna talk about
[00:00:29] the pie challenge so the pie challenge
[00:00:33] is actually something that I performed
[00:00:36] or attempted to perform last week I'll
[00:00:38] get more into it in a moment but before
[00:00:41] I start with that I just want to give a
[00:00:42] quick shout out to our sponsors the
[00:00:46] extreme memory challenge which is
[00:00:48] somewhat related to the pie challenge
[00:00:50] I'll explain that in a little bit but
[00:00:52] with the extreme memory challenge these
[00:00:55] folks at dark neuroscience a
[00:00:58] pharmaceutical company doing some
[00:01:00] groundbreaking research in
[00:01:02] cognitive disabilities and how to cure
[00:01:05] them what interests me of course is the
[00:01:08] relation to Alzheimer's disease which is
[00:01:10] something that took my grandmother and
[00:01:11] what they are doing amongst many
[00:01:14] different research projects the one that
[00:01:16] I'm part of is the extreme memory
[00:01:18] challenge and what it is is an effort to
[00:01:21] find a million-plus test-takers to take
[00:01:25] a very easy quick fun free memory test
[00:01:29] and the results remain anonymous you get
[00:01:32] to see the results but it remains
[00:01:35] anonymous in this massive massive
[00:01:37] project where they're trying to get as
[00:01:40] many people to take a memory test in
[00:01:43] order to figure out what memory looks
[00:01:46] like across a large very large sample
[00:01:50] size this would be the biggest memory
[00:01:53] research project in history a long-term
[00:01:55] memory that is and so what we're
[00:01:58] interested in is actually that long-term
[00:02:00] memory not necessarily
[00:02:03] everyday short-term memory whatever just
[00:02:05] long-term memory the ability to remember
[00:02:08] things over the period of time and it
[00:02:12] doesn't matter where you have a good
[00:02:13] memory or a bad memory the goal is to
[00:02:16] get people to take this test to share it
[00:02:18] because the reason for a large sample
[00:02:21] size why it's important is we need the
[00:02:24] whole spectrum right we need the people
[00:02:25] who are
[00:02:26] average in memory long-term memory
[00:02:29] people who are
[00:02:30] piss-poor and people who are at the very
[00:02:34] top and
[00:02:35] what we'll do following that is we'll
[00:02:39] select the people who perform the best
[00:02:41] and you know maybe there are people who
[00:02:44] were perfect and have incredible natural
[00:02:47] long-term memories
[00:02:49] that's what we're trying to figure out
[00:02:50] but anyways we will further investigate
[00:02:53] the people who are at the top taking DNA
[00:02:55] samples giving them more intense
[00:02:59] mental
[00:03:01] tests batteries and
[00:03:04] eventually
[00:03:07] seeing what we can learn about memory
[00:03:09] and and what's different from those kind
[00:03:11] of people
[00:03:12] compared to the average so head to
[00:03:15] extreme memory challenge calm please
[00:03:18] take this test it's awesome I've done it
[00:03:21] everyone I know in the memory world has
[00:03:23] done it so please take it it's for a
[00:03:26] good cause and for something that's very
[00:03:29] important to me which is hopefully and
[00:03:32] it's not going to be tomorrow but down
[00:03:34] the road hopefully a cure for
[00:03:37] Alzheimer's disease so with that let's
[00:03:40] jump in this is a podcast not
[00:03:43] necessarily an interview per se as I
[00:03:45] will be doing the talking but this is a
[00:03:48] podcast on how I memorized 10,000 digits
[00:03:52] of pi the Everest of Pi challenges so
[00:03:56] here we go
[00:04:00] hello and welcome again this is Nelson
[00:04:03] Dellis your host and today we are gonna
[00:04:06] talk about how
[00:04:08] one memorizes 10,000 digits of pi
[00:04:13] right so what do you probably know most
[00:04:17] people probably know
[00:04:18] three-point you can say with me 1/4
[00:04:23] that's about most people some toolkit
[00:04:26] maybe go an extra digit one right
[00:04:30] 3.141592 that's kind of what I keep it
[00:04:34] actually this is what I keep in my
[00:04:36] average
[00:04:38] arsenal of pi digits right and it's
[00:04:40] something I just have to say faster
[00:04:42] 3.141592 no
[00:04:46] 3.14159265 three five eight nine seven
[00:04:49] nine that's what I usually keep sorry
[00:04:53] and I've in different occasions I've
[00:04:56] memorized a hundred digits here for a
[00:04:58] show or for a presentation I did back in
[00:05:02] 2014 actually memorized 1000 digits and
[00:05:05] the audience of this
[00:05:08] event there were three thousand people
[00:05:10] in the audience was a huge event
[00:05:12] randomly chose some segments of 10
[00:05:15] digits anywhere in that thousand and I
[00:05:18] had to recite the next time and the
[00:05:19] previous file the previous 10 and that
[00:05:22] idea came from a record that exists
[00:05:24] called the
[00:05:26] Everest of Pi challenges also known as
[00:05:30] Pi matrix memorization and what it is is
[00:05:35] you memorize 10,000 digits of pi in
[00:05:39] segments of 5
[00:05:40] and there are specific segments of 5
[00:05:43] it's not like any 5 it's starting from 3
[00:05:46] point so one four one five one four one
[00:05:50] five nine is the first five and then the
[00:05:53] next five in the next five so you
[00:05:54] memorize PI up to 10,000 digits in fives
[00:05:57] like that and the record is how quickly
[00:06:01] so it's a time-based how quickly can you
[00:06:03] recall perfectly so no errors
[00:06:06] 50 randoms randomly selected five digit
[00:06:10] segments within the 10,000 so these are
[00:06:13] selected by judges at random and they
[00:06:15] will say them out loud a five digit
[00:06:18] chunk and you have to say the next five
[00:06:20] and the previous five 50 times as fast
[00:06:24] as possible with no errors the current
[00:06:27] record is 16 minutes 38 seconds by Kevin
[00:06:31] Horsley of South Africa who is a memory
[00:06:33] competitor and a grand master of memory
[00:06:36] as well so he holds that record I think
[00:06:37] he used to hold it back in the late
[00:06:41] 1990s and it was taken away from him and
[00:06:44] he came back and redid it in 2013 on pi
[00:06:47] day and reclaimed that title quite
[00:06:51] impressively so 16 minutes 38 seconds if
[00:06:54] you do the math on 50 randomly selected
[00:06:58] segments that gives you roughly about 20
[00:07:01] seconds per
[00:07:03] answer right so if you think about it
[00:07:06] the way the the way the
[00:07:09] challenge is set up is the the digits
[00:07:12] will be set out loud so 20 seconds for
[00:07:15] the COS to say the five digits for you
[00:07:19] the record breaker to think about it to
[00:07:21] figure out where that five digits are
[00:07:23] and also to say the next five and the
[00:07:26] previous five digits all in twenty
[00:07:27] seconds and that's just to meet that
[00:07:29] record right if it's going to be broken
[00:07:31] that will be
[00:07:34] have to be a little bit faster on
[00:07:37] average
[00:07:37] so quite challenging and the cool thing
[00:07:40] about this memory challenge is its
[00:07:43] time-based usually a lot of records are
[00:07:46] just like how much can you memorize
[00:07:47] right so the typical PI
[00:07:50] records are how many digits did you
[00:07:52] memorize and say them from digit one to
[00:07:56] digit and and I think some of them are
[00:07:59] even they time how fast you can say them
[00:08:01] but if you're going for massive
[00:08:03] quantities I think the record for most
[00:08:06] digits ever memorized is in the 70
[00:08:08] thousands I think that's confirmed I
[00:08:12] think I've read a story where a Japanese
[00:08:14] man did a hundred and ten thousand but I
[00:08:16] don't see any
[00:08:17] confirmation of that by some official
[00:08:21] organization so
[00:08:23] so that's the Everest of PI challenges
[00:08:26] and so I decided along with a friend of
[00:08:30] mine Brad's up who's been a memory
[00:08:32] memory competitor
[00:08:34] since I started all this stuff back in
[00:08:36] 2009 and we became friends at the
[00:08:39] competitions and
[00:08:41] we just wanted to do something you know
[00:08:44] different from our memory training a bit
[00:08:47] of the challenge and something that we
[00:08:48] could build an event around on world
[00:08:51] Alzheimer's day which was last Wednesday
[00:08:54] the 21st of September and to raise a bit
[00:08:57] of awareness for both Alzheimer's and
[00:09:00] dark neuroscience and their extreme
[00:09:02] memory challenge which I mentioned at
[00:09:04] the beginning of this podcast
[00:09:05] so the question is how did I memorize
[00:09:10] 10,000 digits of pi and I guess the
[00:09:13] bigger question is how did I memorize
[00:09:15] 10,000 of anything and I guess the best
[00:09:19] place to start is
[00:09:22] how long did this take me right so
[00:09:25] 10,000 digits
[00:09:27] for me and this is crazy is that
[00:09:30] thinking about it and when I talk about
[00:09:32] it to people 10,000 actually seems quite
[00:09:34] small
[00:09:36] you know I know people who have
[00:09:39] memorized PI to many many thousands of
[00:09:41] digits so ten thousand I kind of say it
[00:09:45] sheepish sheepishly to my friends but to
[00:09:49] people who don't know about memory and
[00:09:52] memory Sports 10,000 seems like
[00:09:54] something impossible right imagine you
[00:09:57] had to memorize 10,000 things and you
[00:10:01] were gonna be quizzed on it right not a
[00:10:04] very
[00:10:06] simple task something that seems quite
[00:10:08] daunting I would assume and so you'd be
[00:10:12] surprised to know that you know I
[00:10:14] actually broke it down into thousands I
[00:10:16] would memorize a thousand digits here
[00:10:19] and there and it would take me about an
[00:10:22] hour max to really have that thousand
[00:10:25] down backwards and forwards I
[00:10:28] really made only two passes through
[00:10:31] those digits before I had it and then
[00:10:33] I'd maybe do a review in my head and and
[00:10:37] kind of fix up the small little weaker
[00:10:39] joints of that thousand so that it would
[00:10:43] be solid so let's say a thousand digits
[00:10:46] in an hour and I wasn't in a huge rush
[00:10:49] so I spread it out over the course of
[00:10:51] two weeks more like ten days right a
[00:10:54] thousand digits
[00:10:57] in ten days I think I took a break here
[00:11:01] and there but yeah about two weeks to
[00:11:03] get it in my head and a thousand digits
[00:11:06] in one day ten hours or so of of
[00:11:10] learning
[00:11:13] honestly probably less but
[00:11:16] that's one part right getting the digits
[00:11:19] in my head the next was being a master
[00:11:22] of these digits right so the tests
[00:11:24] itself the challenge
[00:11:26] really commands you to know all the
[00:11:29] digits equally well and that you're
[00:11:33] familiar with all of them the same way
[00:11:36] you know a judge could easily ask a five
[00:11:39] digit segment that you're kind of iffy
[00:11:41] on or it's a little more wishy-washy and
[00:11:46] fuzzy in your head than some others that
[00:11:48] are like sharp and you can pinpoint them
[00:11:50] in an instant
[00:11:51] but that isn't the way you're gonna
[00:11:53] break this record you need to know all
[00:11:56] and if you do the math that's
[00:11:59] 2005 digit segments right two thousand
[00:12:03] times five is ten thousand digits right
[00:12:05] so you need to know 10 2000 things 2000
[00:12:08] pictures
[00:12:10] and I'll talk about the pictures in a
[00:12:12] moment you need to know those like your
[00:12:14] best friend each one is super special
[00:12:18] and unique and it pops out in your mind
[00:12:21] which sounds all good at all but if you
[00:12:24] think about it five digits over the span
[00:12:27] of 10,000 possible
[00:12:30] combinations well two thousand possible
[00:12:32] combinations you're gonna get some
[00:12:35] similar or repeated some similar or
[00:12:38] repeated segments no and actually yeah
[00:12:42] so there are these things called
[00:12:43] collisions which there are 24 of them
[00:12:46] these are pairs that could be found
[00:12:48] within that first 10,000 of Pi and
[00:12:51] they're the exact same five digits so 24
[00:12:54] times you see a pair actually 48 if you
[00:12:58] write but there twenty four pairs and
[00:13:00] actually that's why the record is ten
[00:13:03] thousand digits it's because
[00:13:06] past ten thousand and there's been
[00:13:08] papers published on this the number of
[00:13:10] collisions
[00:13:12] increases like crazy so
[00:13:15] the thing is when we do the challenge
[00:13:18] and if you're accidentally or just
[00:13:20] randomly chosen to say one of these
[00:13:23] collision pairs you actually say both as
[00:13:26] the answer so
[00:13:28] that can be a delay right and a bit of
[00:13:31] confusion as well so you can imagine
[00:13:33] past ten thousand if those kind of jump
[00:13:35] up and that's only pair collisions I
[00:13:38] don't know if or how many there are of
[00:13:40] triplets or quadruplets
[00:13:41] I'm sure they come up eventually PI's
[00:13:44] infinite so that's something to consider
[00:13:47] and
[00:13:49] yeah so it's all about knowing each of
[00:13:52] those five digit segments really well
[00:13:54] and what that comes down to once you
[00:13:57] learn it right took me at most ten hours
[00:14:00] to learn at all its review and that's
[00:14:04] all
[00:14:05] what
[00:14:06] long-term memory is about is review so
[00:14:09] the techniques that I use to get the PI
[00:14:11] digits in my head I'll go over in a
[00:14:13] moment that's one thing and that's
[00:14:16] probably the easiest part surprisingly
[00:14:18] the next part is mastering and reviewing
[00:14:21] and studying that information so that
[00:14:23] it's instant that it's
[00:14:25] it's a part of me that it's so fluid and
[00:14:29] you know it's like trying to recite your
[00:14:32] phone number almost people probably
[00:14:34] don't even know their phone number but
[00:14:35] it's within you right you don't have to
[00:14:37] think about it or pull it from memory
[00:14:38] it's just boom right there right so
[00:14:41] that's what I need you to do for all
[00:14:43] those
[00:14:44] let's talk about how I put the ten
[00:14:47] thousand digits in my head so I have a
[00:14:51] number system it's something I've kind
[00:14:55] of molded over the past seven years and
[00:14:57] it's a three digit system so I have a
[00:15:00] picture of something
[00:15:03] specifically a person and object that's
[00:15:06] associated to the person for every
[00:15:08] three-digit combination from zero zero
[00:15:11] zero
[00:15:12] nine nine nine if you do the math that's
[00:15:15] a thousand different images I have a
[00:15:17] thousand different people and a thousand
[00:15:20] different objects and
[00:15:21] usually what I'll do in memory
[00:15:24] competitions is I'll do a person action
[00:15:27] object scenario if you ever heard of
[00:15:29] that it's taking some digits turning it
[00:15:33] into a person and then following that up
[00:15:35] with some digits that represented action
[00:15:37] and then following that up with some
[00:15:39] digits that represent an object together
[00:15:42] that creates this funny little scene
[00:15:44] called a person action object and it's
[00:15:48] exactly that it's a person performing an
[00:15:51] action with an object and that kind of
[00:15:54] visualize helps you visualize a little
[00:15:57] scene a very memorable scene
[00:16:00] that can be translated and back to
[00:16:03] digits
[00:16:05] so for me like I said I'd do three
[00:16:08] digits for a person actually my actions
[00:16:11] are only two digits which means they
[00:16:13] have 100 actions and then my objects are
[00:16:15] another three so that's eight digits I
[00:16:17] usually do at a time
[00:16:19] for this challenge that didn't really
[00:16:21] makes sense because I have to do it in
[00:16:23] fives so at first I thought maybe I'll
[00:16:25] do person action right three to every
[00:16:29] five digits segment is a person doing an
[00:16:31] action but since there's only 100
[00:16:34] actions that can be
[00:16:36] probably
[00:16:38] repetitive and tricky so I thought of
[00:16:43] another idea where I would do person
[00:16:44] object and since that's three three six
[00:16:47] digits but I'm only needing five how
[00:16:50] about I overlap the last digit of the
[00:16:52] person and the first digit of the object
[00:16:54] so you can picture that three and three
[00:16:57] with that middle digit overlapping both
[00:17:00] sets and the cool advantage of that is
[00:17:04] if I remember the person or only the act
[00:17:06] the object I kind of have information
[00:17:10] about the other part right in case I'm
[00:17:14] kind of fuzzy on something so it's a
[00:17:15] little bit of a fail-safe not much but
[00:17:18] maybe an extra digit that will help me
[00:17:20] figure it out if I'm having trouble
[00:17:23] recalling it so that was set up already
[00:17:26] I've known those for many years and
[00:17:30] you know ultimately that's that's just a
[00:17:33] way to chunk that five digit segment
[00:17:36] into a more meaningful picture I think
[00:17:38] Brad has a 2-digit system he does a
[00:17:40] person action object thing and he did -
[00:17:43] - while he did - - - right person action
[00:17:46] object - digits two digits and two
[00:17:48] digits and he overlapped one of the
[00:17:50] digits I think between
[00:17:52] the last four
[00:17:55] but that's his system and he did it
[00:17:58] equally as good as me so
[00:18:01] the point is is you need to find a way
[00:18:03] to translate the digits into a picture a
[00:18:06] memorable picture and for me that person
[00:18:09] object 3 3 was the way to go and I think
[00:18:13] for me
[00:18:15] having a three-digit system was a slight
[00:18:17] advantage over a two digit system
[00:18:19] because you have a thousand different
[00:18:22] people a thousand different actions
[00:18:23] objects I'm sorry to mix together and
[00:18:28] come up randomly and that will cause
[00:18:31] less clashes of similar images not the
[00:18:35] repeats right those are 24 of them but
[00:18:37] some clashes of similar people you know
[00:18:42] maybe with different objects or similar
[00:18:44] objects with different people stuff like
[00:18:46] that so that worked pretty well for me
[00:18:49] and to speed up the process I wrote a
[00:18:51] little script
[00:18:52] [Music]
[00:18:54] on my computer that automatically read
[00:18:57] the digits and are pre translated them
[00:19:00] into pictures just the words of the
[00:19:02] people and the objects that they
[00:19:04] represented much easier to go through
[00:19:06] those digits quicker I only had to read
[00:19:08] like a list of of words rather than
[00:19:11] numbers and that was just done to save a
[00:19:13] bit of time from actually staring at
[00:19:16] digits and having to convert them to
[00:19:17] people and objects so that was that I
[00:19:20] made far not five ten different ten
[00:19:24] different documents each with a thousand
[00:19:26] digits basically a list of 200
[00:19:29] person objects pairs
[00:19:33] right if that's every thousand digits is
[00:19:36] just 200 images right
[00:19:39] five digit segments the next part is
[00:19:42] where to store them how did I remember
[00:19:45] them right so I'm reading all these
[00:19:47] funny pictures but where am i placing
[00:19:49] them and so I was using a memory palace
[00:19:52] which if you google you'll find tons of
[00:19:55] information about it
[00:19:57] now I would need a memory palace of
[00:20:01] 2,000 locations right to store all these
[00:20:04] digits that's a ton for the stuff that I
[00:20:07] typically memorize a deck of cards
[00:20:10] 400 digit number a series of words
[00:20:14] whatever the most I ever used honestly
[00:20:17] is something with 60 locations for cards
[00:20:21] you know I have there are 17 locations
[00:20:24] long you don't need that many to store
[00:20:26] all that information but this one
[00:20:29] requires a massive amount of location so
[00:20:32] this was the trickiest part I've never
[00:20:35] created a memory palace that's bigger
[00:20:38] than I think 80 or something and now I
[00:20:41] have to do 200 right times 10
[00:20:45] so what I decided is okay I'll come up
[00:20:47] with 10 different journeys different
[00:20:49] memory palaces with 200 locations each
[00:20:52] and so for that to happen you know they
[00:20:56] were gonna be I knew they were gonna be
[00:20:57] really expansive these these journeys
[00:21:00] you know sprawling across city or all
[00:21:04] around different stores and things like
[00:21:07] that that makes sense to me so I put
[00:21:10] together with my first one to learn the
[00:21:12] first thousand again and that was my
[00:21:14] high school the high school wasn't
[00:21:17] enough I had to continue walking from
[00:21:18] the high school to
[00:21:20] South Miami through the mall that's
[00:21:23] there and then through kind of Little
[00:21:25] Shop areas around it pretty pretty big
[00:21:28] but I know that one pretty well I've
[00:21:30] used parts of it before I just taped
[00:21:32] over at this time and
[00:21:34] that didn't seem so hard I memorize the
[00:21:37] first thousand pretty easily
[00:21:39] the next nine memory palaces I really
[00:21:42] had to figure out from scratch and you
[00:21:46] know I used parts of Miami where I'm
[00:21:48] from as those palaces so one was
[00:21:51] downtown Miami
[00:21:53] my old apartment going through the whole
[00:21:55] building up the main street there into
[00:21:58] my friend's building into another
[00:21:59] friend's building through the gym
[00:22:02] through some shops
[00:22:04] it was a long walk but um I got all the
[00:22:07] digits in there and then I did another
[00:22:09] one through my current apartment and
[00:22:11] then I tried something different which
[00:22:13] was for my in-laws house I used their
[00:22:16] house and I tried to just use only the
[00:22:19] house right so no big sprawling journey
[00:22:23] just one house 200 things inside that
[00:22:27] house so I really had to shrink myself
[00:22:29] down mentally and walk through that
[00:22:32] house and use every little piece of
[00:22:33] furniture every light switch every lamp
[00:22:36] whatever as a location so that was
[00:22:39] something I've never done before and it
[00:22:41] worked really well actually the nice
[00:22:43] thing about it is you have everything
[00:22:45] kind of contained under one roof it's
[00:22:47] not so sprawling and and I did similar
[00:22:52] things later on my parents house I did
[00:22:55] some that were on Everest base camp in
[00:22:58] Kathmandu something things that were
[00:23:00] different because after a while going
[00:23:03] through stores and houses and rooms a
[00:23:07] lot of them kind of looked the same
[00:23:09] right I think I had a few going through
[00:23:11] Chipotle's and
[00:23:14] I had trouble or like kwik-e-mart s-- or
[00:23:17] 711s and I had trouble kind of
[00:23:19] remembering oh wait was this from that's
[00:23:21] in a loud or that 7/11 so I tried to
[00:23:24] switch things up that's why I went to
[00:23:25] Kathmandu and did some Evera stuff and
[00:23:28] then went to the Florida Keys that was
[00:23:31] another memory palace and so when I say
[00:23:34] I'm using 200 locations
[00:23:36] what I'm doing is I'm making a path
[00:23:39] through that space stopping at 200
[00:23:42] points right so if we go to my in-laws
[00:23:45] house for example I start in the bedroom
[00:23:46] the first location is on the lamp shade
[00:23:50] by my bed the next one is the light
[00:23:53] switch on the wall right next to it the
[00:23:56] next one is the air conditioner in the
[00:23:58] wall then a door a closet that inside
[00:24:02] the closet then on the floor by the
[00:24:04] closet
[00:24:05] the bedsheets on the pillows on the
[00:24:07] window pane behind the bed on the other
[00:24:13] bedside table the other closet etc so
[00:24:17] it's very tight but I'm making a little
[00:24:19] journey pathway through the room I exit
[00:24:22] the room then go through another room
[00:24:23] and make my way around the house till I
[00:24:26] have those 200 locations
[00:24:28] tiring but
[00:24:31] it worked and after two weeks I had
[00:24:34] those digits in my head and I had two
[00:24:36] weeks left before the challenge and I
[00:24:38] made sure to review
[00:24:40] at least for an hour a day I wrote a
[00:24:43] little program on a computer to test me
[00:24:46] to randomly choose segments and it would
[00:24:48] test me and it would correct me or tests
[00:24:51] check my correct my answers if they were
[00:24:54] correct or not so that was a good way to
[00:24:57] practice I have my fiancee read some
[00:25:00] randomly chosen ones out loud to try and
[00:25:02] mimic how it will be an actual challenge
[00:25:04] and I felt good I mean I had done a
[00:25:08] couple run throughs perfectly in just
[00:25:12] about the time that I needed to to break
[00:25:14] the record but most times I was making a
[00:25:17] mistake here there I'd say I knew
[00:25:23] 90% of those mm really really really
[00:25:27] well and then the other ten you know
[00:25:29] kind of we're like good but sometimes I
[00:25:33] questionable in them and yeah so but 90%
[00:25:36] is not good enough right it has to be
[00:25:38] 100% for this record so that's how I
[00:25:41] memorized 10,000 there's digits of pi
[00:25:43] and
[00:25:45] let me talk a little bit about the
[00:25:47] challenge so the day of the challenge we
[00:25:49] flew to San Diego to dart neuroscience
[00:25:52] to do the event there on Facebook live
[00:25:54] and the judges we had a panel of five
[00:25:57] judges had pre chosen the 50 segments
[00:26:02] that we're gonna be chosen and I had
[00:26:04] never seen him of course and we had
[00:26:06] three attempts each Brad and I so at
[00:26:09] least we had a little bit of warm-up and
[00:26:11] three attempts to kind of nail it down
[00:26:14] my first attempt
[00:26:17] moves along quite I think I got to the
[00:26:19] 11th one and
[00:26:21] misspoke a digit that was the end of it
[00:26:24] right one error and you're done
[00:26:26] Brad went I don't remember what he
[00:26:29] scored then I went again and did
[00:26:32] thirteen this time before messing up and
[00:26:35] I remember it's one of those situations
[00:26:37] where I said something I said a digit
[00:26:39] that was wrong and I knew it as I said
[00:26:42] it so that was silly
[00:26:44] my 10th was over Brad went I think he
[00:26:47] got about nine
[00:26:48] similar thing he failed on saying the
[00:26:51] wrong digit and then our last attempts
[00:26:53] both Brad and I we couldn't get past the
[00:26:55] first one it was just they chose one
[00:26:58] that was like a little rusty for me and
[00:27:00] that was at the end of it so a failed
[00:27:03] attempt unfortunately failed three
[00:27:05] attempts but the goal of the event
[00:27:07] ultimately was to raise awareness which
[00:27:09] I think we did and you know it was a
[00:27:12] good experience in memorizing something
[00:27:15] massive which I've never really done
[00:27:17] anything that big
[00:27:19] you know it gave me a little bit of
[00:27:21] confidence and I think from now on I
[00:27:24] want to try and do some more of those
[00:27:26] challenges I'm eyeing this one Guinness
[00:27:28] record for next January stay tuned on
[00:27:32] that one that's really gonna be a really
[00:27:33] cool one and I think I might try this
[00:27:35] again and on pi day or something next
[00:27:38] year the thing is is it was really fun
[00:27:41] you know coming up with all these
[00:27:43] journeys and pictures and it kind of
[00:27:45] pushed me to do something new in memory
[00:27:46] that I hadn't done and you know seven
[00:27:49] years since I started this stuff so that
[00:27:51] was good I think in order to nail this
[00:27:55] challenge as I said before is I need to
[00:27:58] know every single five digit chunk like
[00:28:02] my best friend so I said before I do 90%
[00:28:05] and then I was kind of so so buddy-buddy
[00:28:08] with 10% of the others right so I need
[00:28:11] to study more this challenge really
[00:28:13] comes down to review and how you
[00:28:16] study and how well you know each of
[00:28:19] everyone I mean knowing all of them
[00:28:21] quote-unquote isn't good enough it's
[00:28:23] it's really really knowing all of them
[00:28:25] and all of by all of them I mean all of
[00:28:27] them
[00:28:28] so thanks for listening this is kind of
[00:28:31] a shorter one shorter podcast let me
[00:28:34] close by reminding you to go to extreme
[00:28:37] memory challenge calm to
[00:28:39] take the take the test the memory test
[00:28:42] that's quick and easy and free and
[00:28:44] you'll be helping out
[00:28:46] dark neuroscience on their quest to find
[00:28:49] a cure for these cognitive dissonance
[00:28:52] abling diseases such as Alzheimer's and
[00:28:55] Parkinson's and things like that so
[00:28:57] thanks for listening
[00:28:58] next week we will be following up with
[00:29:02] famed memory all-star Simone Reinhardt
[00:29:07] from Germany I
[00:29:09] formerly held the speed cards record and
[00:29:13] he's just a fascinating guy one of the
[00:29:16] top memory assisted makes sure to stay
[00:29:18] tuned for that and I leave you thank you
[00:29:21] guys thank you guys so much for
[00:29:22] listening and I'll see you next time
[00:29:24] ciao

=== Nelson Dellis' MIND SHOW - Gabriel Wyner // Expert Language Learner ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaZSQN2sSPk

[00:00:06] [Music]
[00:00:15] hello and welcome to another episode of
[00:00:17] the Mind show with me Nelson delis your
[00:00:20] host four-time USA memory champion and
[00:00:24] today we're going to be talking to
[00:00:25] Gabriel Winer who is a polyglot um
[00:00:30] a person who knows multiple languages um
[00:00:33] so he studied Opera um which is often
[00:00:37] sung in multiple languages and
[00:00:39] eventually realized um he wanted to
[00:00:42] learn a language and kind of figured out
[00:00:44] the hacks
[00:00:45] to um learn languages quickly and
[00:00:49] efficiently what's the right way to do
[00:00:50] that and now I believe he speaks almost
[00:00:52] seven languages um to a high degree of
[00:00:55] fluency and it's a fascinating uh read
[00:01:00] it's a fantastic book that he wrote
[00:01:02] which is called fluent forever um it
[00:01:04] came out in 2014 and I've referred to it
[00:01:08] and read it numerous times uh it's
[00:01:10] really got some beautiful tips and gems
[00:01:14] in there that um you can take home and
[00:01:18] and apply to learning an actual language
[00:01:20] um and I mean actually learning it you
[00:01:22] know so many people go into um courses
[00:01:26] language courses or or buy books to
[00:01:28] learn it on their own and they walk away
[00:01:32] with nothing maybe a few learned words
[00:01:34] but no fluency in the language and
[00:01:37] that's that's a common thing and and the
[00:01:39] funny thing is is that learning language
[00:01:41] is probably one of the most you know
[00:01:44] wanted skills um that that people want
[00:01:48] for themselves um how nice would it be
[00:01:50] to be able to speak Italian or speak
[00:01:52] French fluently right um we all would
[00:01:55] love to be able to do that so this book
[00:01:57] addresses that IT addresses the Right
[00:02:00] Way um and the quickest way to gain um
[00:02:04] some proper fluency in the language of
[00:02:06] your choice so we're going to talk with
[00:02:08] Gabriel right now um and see what he's
[00:02:13] working on how we got into this how it
[00:02:16] was writing the book and some tips for
[00:02:19] The Listener you guys to walk away with
[00:02:22] um for when you want to learn a language
[00:02:25] so without further Ado uh let's dive
[00:02:27] into the conversation and I hope you
[00:02:29] enjoy it welcome to another episode of
[00:02:32] the Mind show with me Nelson dallis and
[00:02:35] our guest today is uh Gabriel Wier a
[00:02:38] famed author of fluent forever which is
[00:02:42] an awesome book if you haven't gotten it
[00:02:44] uh go out and buy it it's a great read
[00:02:47] well written and um super helpful um
[00:02:50] thanks for being on this show uh how you
[00:02:52] doing I'm doing well thanks for having
[00:02:54] me yeah it's I've been a fan of your
[00:02:57] well it was first your your blog uh ages
[00:03:00] ago and then your book I just I think
[00:03:03] you sent me uh one of the first uh
[00:03:06] copies of it so I could write you a
[00:03:07] little blur you're on the blur you're on
[00:03:10] the cover that's right yeah um so I'm
[00:03:13] really excited you're here um where are
[00:03:15] where are you where are you based out of
[00:03:17] uh now I'm based in Chicago I moved here
[00:03:19] about a month and a half ago now okay
[00:03:22] all right cool and um so I guess the
[00:03:25] best place to start is to kind of give
[00:03:27] me your background tell me who you are
[00:03:28] for people who are listening or watching
[00:03:30] um yeah um let's see uh my background
[00:03:34] originally is in was in Opera I used to
[00:03:36] be a professional opera singer um before
[00:03:38] all this book and language stuff
[00:03:39] happened um and that kind of led into
[00:03:43] the language stuff um in the sense that
[00:03:45] I needed to learn a bunch of languages
[00:03:47] for Opera I need to learn Italian German
[00:03:49] French Russian would be good uh and with
[00:03:53] that kind
[00:03:55] of uh I don't know requirement with that
[00:03:57] kind of stuff ahead of me it it became
[00:04:01] uh useful to start looking for
[00:04:03] efficiency hacks yeah sure cuz they're
[00:04:06] four times as useful for me than for
[00:04:08] most people yeah uh so I could spend
[00:04:11] four times as much time looking for them
[00:04:13] and it would still be worth it um yeah
[00:04:15] and uh so yeah basically I I got myself
[00:04:19] into a situation where I I cheated on a
[00:04:22] test and in order to get into a French
[00:04:23] program that I didn't belong into um I
[00:04:26] cheated too well uh they stuck me in a
[00:04:29] program that was way above my level and
[00:04:31] I had three months to kind of learn
[00:04:33] French uh at least up to an intermediate
[00:04:35] level okay and I had no time and so I uh
[00:04:39] sort of discovered spaced repetition I
[00:04:41] had already had some experience with uh
[00:04:44] with German and Italian and I had kind
[00:04:47] of figured out that the translation was
[00:04:48] not going to help me uh and so I started
[00:04:52] combining space repetition with uh
[00:04:55] basically with with flashcards that
[00:04:57] didn't involve anything other than
[00:04:59] French or pictures okay and at the end
[00:05:02] of the 3-month period where I was
[00:05:04] studying basically an hour a day and
[00:05:05] then a lot on Sundays um I showed up to
[00:05:08] my first conversation in French because
[00:05:10] they have an interview in the beginning
[00:05:11] to kind of force you to like yeah well
[00:05:13] to to make sure you didn't cheat and
[00:05:16] uh and I had a conversation in French
[00:05:18] and I realized I could actually think in
[00:05:20] French and and I had a full 15-minute
[00:05:22] conversation she was like oh we're
[00:05:23] replaced you in the wrong class you need
[00:05:25] to be bumped up to another level higher
[00:05:27] higher wow yeah and by the end of that
[00:05:29] it was like I fully fluent in French uh
[00:05:31] in 5 months basically it was 3 months of
[00:05:33] my own studies and two months of that
[00:05:35] immersion program and I thought this is
[00:05:36] something that needs to be spread around
[00:05:38] and that's where all this stuff started
[00:05:40] that's amazing so growing up where did
[00:05:43] you grow up Los Angeles Los Angeles okay
[00:05:45] and is are your parents American or they
[00:05:48] from somewhere else do they speak other
[00:05:49] languages my parents are American uh my
[00:05:52] mother is I guess second generation
[00:05:54] first generation her her parents came
[00:05:56] over
[00:05:57] from now is Ukraine I think it's the
[00:06:00] like Transylvania basically but uh but
[00:06:03] they were her her mother spoke
[00:06:05] everything I think she speaks like seven
[00:06:08] or six or seven languages um but in the
[00:06:10] house uh she was my grandmother and my
[00:06:13] mother spoke Yiddish together I see okay
[00:06:16] um and so my mother is bilingual in
[00:06:17] Yiddish but they they never spoke that
[00:06:20] around us around me and my brother so so
[00:06:22] your upgra was pretty much English um
[00:06:25] this was English although we did go to a
[00:06:26] Hebrew Elementary School uh and so we
[00:06:29] were taking Hebrew lessons every day but
[00:06:31] at the end of that the seven years of
[00:06:33] Hebrew school I I didn't know anything I
[00:06:35] mean was it's kind of frustrating I
[00:06:36] could read the alphabet and right now
[00:06:38] someone like I'm working on Hebrew right
[00:06:40] now for for my app development stuff
[00:06:42] yeah and I know like 20 words it's
[00:06:45] really frustrating you took seven years
[00:06:47] of it yeah yeah and like I can be like I
[00:06:50] I I'm surprised at all the pronunciation
[00:06:52] stuff like uh in terms of the like
[00:06:55] spelling rules and stuff in Hebrew I'm
[00:06:57] like this this is how this works like
[00:06:58] that's how you say that word and I just
[00:07:00] feel so stupid having spent all that
[00:07:01] time yeah and not gotten really much of
[00:07:04] anything right I mean I feel like that's
[00:07:06] the common story at least in the United
[00:07:08] States where you know for example my
[00:07:10] fiance she she took French and Italian
[00:07:13] all through high school she was in like
[00:07:15] you know the advanced classes and you
[00:07:18] walk away with nothing and uh it's crazy
[00:07:22] you know I I was lucky to have been
[00:07:24] brought up with French speaking parents
[00:07:27] so it was always drilled in us we lived
[00:07:29] there
[00:07:30] um and so I could say I was fluent but
[00:07:33] um you know a lot of Americans don't get
[00:07:35] that opportunity and it's um I think
[00:07:38] there's well probably and you can you
[00:07:40] probably know better than I do but the
[00:07:41] way that it's taught and and the way
[00:07:43] that they approach it in in high schools
[00:07:44] isn't necessarily the best way to learn
[00:07:46] language I think that's true yeah I mean
[00:07:49] I think even if you have good teachers
[00:07:50] and I like I I had that experience again
[00:07:52] after this whole Hebrew thing I I did it
[00:07:54] again with Russian uh I took five and a
[00:07:56] half years of Russian in in sort of I
[00:07:58] don't know Junior High in high school
[00:07:59] and it's like I I left there also with
[00:08:01] basically nothing and I had good
[00:08:02] teachers and like that was the really
[00:08:04] frustrating thing like I I chose that
[00:08:05] language because of the teachers yeah
[00:08:08] and I still left with nothing and it's
[00:08:09] was like there's something really wrong
[00:08:11] with the methodology that the people are
[00:08:12] using yeah but that that's great to hear
[00:08:15] that you came from a background with
[00:08:17] basically no foreign language and that
[00:08:19] here you are how so how many languages
[00:08:21] do you speak now I don't know six and
[00:08:23] 3/4 six and a half I'm I'm most of the
[00:08:26] way fluent right this would be fluent I
[00:08:28] mean where where do you the line in
[00:08:30] terms of fluency is tricky but I can
[00:08:32] think and have conversations in these
[00:08:33] languages uh and so I guess if you're
[00:08:35] including English then sevenish I'm most
[00:08:38] of the way through Japanese I have
[00:08:39] another honestly I'd love to give it
[00:08:41] another year I I only have three more
[00:08:43] months because my fiance require me to
[00:08:45] learn Spanish this year for our wedding
[00:08:47] so okay is she Spanish she's she's
[00:08:49] Mexican American yeah okay okay got it
[00:08:52] um so with those seven languages uh six
[00:08:55] and change you can be dropped you could
[00:08:57] live in those places where they speak it
[00:08:59] it and and survive well and comfortably
[00:09:02] right yes uh I would say Japanese is
[00:09:06] almost there uh I I was just there over
[00:09:08] the summer I spent a month there and it
[00:09:10] was like I I could get around like it
[00:09:12] was this I can I can function uh and I
[00:09:14] can even have sort of conversations but
[00:09:16] like that's a big language like that has
[00:09:19] there's so much data that needs to be
[00:09:22] brought in there that it's like it's
[00:09:24] it's a real undertaking but still like
[00:09:25] Japanese yes I can function and the
[00:09:27] other ones are generally above level
[00:09:30] okay so let's let's go through the list
[00:09:32] what do you have you have English part
[00:09:33] Japan yes Japanese I mean what else
[00:09:37] German is fluent fluent fluent um French
[00:09:39] at its peak was similar to German I
[00:09:41] would say it was at a C1 almost C2 level
[00:09:44] in terms of the European ratings but
[00:09:46] like as a as a good level of fluency uh
[00:09:49] would take some like a month or so to
[00:09:51] get back um Russian was slightly below
[00:09:54] French but was at a very very good level
[00:09:56] I think I got certified at B2 in the
[00:09:58] European thing which is like can handle
[00:10:00] most situations um Italian was just
[00:10:04] under Russian but was at a pretty good
[00:10:05] level I've been to Italy a number of
[00:10:07] times and can run like conversations
[00:10:09] stuff like that um Hungarian I chat
[00:10:11] every week with my tutor and we just
[00:10:13] chat about life uh that's at a pretty
[00:10:15] good level um what am I missing am I
[00:10:18] missing anything Japanese is that six
[00:10:20] seven I think so yeah okay yeah that
[00:10:23] that's good and what's what's your
[00:10:24] favorite or easiest I don't know what
[00:10:27] was the I guess Russian probably was the
[00:10:29] the most difficult I mean Japanese is by
[00:10:32] far the most japanes like they they're
[00:10:35] there's actually good data on this as to
[00:10:36] like Which languages are supposed to be
[00:10:37] hard for English Learners like Japanese
[00:10:39] is supposed to be twice as hard as
[00:10:41] Russian plus a little bit okay and it's
[00:10:44] it's bearing out like yeah that's just
[00:10:46] it's it's definitely twice as much data
[00:10:47] if not a little bit more um I don't know
[00:10:51] I mean I the interesting thing about
[00:10:52] these languages is that
[00:10:54] um as
[00:10:58] you as first languages like if you're
[00:11:00] just purely bilingual like your
[00:11:01] background right like generally what if
[00:11:04] you look at studies and things like your
[00:11:07] personality should be roughly the same
[00:11:09] in the two languages if you grow up that
[00:11:10] way yeah you might notice slight
[00:11:12] differences but for the most part you or
[00:11:14] you in in French or you you in English
[00:11:17] um but as a second language learner you
[00:11:19] uh you're picking up this language and
[00:11:21] you're forming memories only in a
[00:11:22] particular chunk of your life oh that's
[00:11:24] true yeah with with particular
[00:11:26] experiences and it's not the whole thing
[00:11:28] it's not all of you it's just little
[00:11:29] segment of you yeah and so that forms
[00:11:31] its own little personality and so like
[00:11:34] Italian I learned exclusively eating
[00:11:37] awesome food in Italy which is the way
[00:11:39] you should learn that language I think
[00:11:41] yeah and like and so Italian like I
[00:11:44] would say Italian is right now right now
[00:11:46] is probably at probably the lowest level
[00:11:48] of my languages and I like I really want
[00:11:49] Italian to be at a higher level when I
[00:11:51] ever get time to do this thing but like
[00:11:53] Italian's associations every single word
[00:11:55] in Italian is associated with the best
[00:11:58] things and no negative experiences okay
[00:12:01] and so that one probably wins in terms
[00:12:03] of overall positivity even though it's
[00:12:04] at probably the lowest level yeah yeah
[00:12:07] okay got it that was actually my my one
[00:12:09] of my questions was um how do you find
[00:12:11] your personality and your kind of body
[00:12:14] language and everything when you talk in
[00:12:15] these different languages because I mean
[00:12:17] I grew up speaking French but I do feel
[00:12:19] like not that I'm a different person but
[00:12:22] I definitely like my manorisms are
[00:12:24] different and uh I think my voice
[00:12:26] probably shifts in tone
[00:12:30] and just the way I Mo it's it's a
[00:12:31] bizarre thing but that's the way I have
[00:12:34] to do it otherwise it doesn't feel like
[00:12:35] I'm speaking it correctly you
[00:12:38] know um I mean you're you're you're
[00:12:40] learning this thing from particular
[00:12:42] sources and those sources are going to
[00:12:44] be making those body motions and like in
[00:12:46] some cases even the pronunciation forces
[00:12:48] your mouth in a position that is just
[00:12:50] different and and so I think it comes
[00:12:53] relatively naturally as long as you're
[00:12:55] you're you're careful about where you're
[00:12:56] getting your language I mean as if
[00:12:57] you're getting most of your content from
[00:12:59] native speakers then that's going to
[00:13:01] come in I think without a choice in the
[00:13:04] matter I think one of the problems is
[00:13:05] that when you're when you're studying
[00:13:07] something I think a lot of people have
[00:13:08] like studied a language in high school
[00:13:10] from like American teachers who don't
[00:13:12] value accent yeah and don't really value
[00:13:14] that kind of thing and then so you get
[00:13:16] you get teachers coming in saying like
[00:13:17] oh Bon jure everybody and like
[00:13:19] everyone's like bon jour and like it it
[00:13:22] ruins it like yeah so if you're careful
[00:13:25] about sources I think that will come
[00:13:27] automatically yeah um so I just want to
[00:13:30] ask a little bit about that school you
[00:13:32] mentioned that you went to where they
[00:13:33] placed you placed yourself higher but
[00:13:35] you actually got placed higher when you
[00:13:36] got there was that the Middlebury
[00:13:38] program yeah that's the Middlebury
[00:13:39] program I've heard about it I think
[00:13:41] through you for the first time I heard
[00:13:42] about it a couple few years ago can you
[00:13:45] tell me more about it for for listeners
[00:13:47] yeah the middle Bo programs are amazing
[00:13:49] uh I I can't recommend them enough
[00:13:51] they're they're the most inconvenient
[00:13:52] thing in the world uh which is to say
[00:13:54] that that it's it's full immersion uh
[00:13:56] you sign a contract that says if I speak
[00:13:58] one word that's not German or not
[00:14:00] Italian or not whatever I'm studying
[00:14:01] then I'm going to get kicked out no
[00:14:03] refund yeah they're intense uh and and
[00:14:06] you have to put your whole life on hold
[00:14:08] like like that's the problem with
[00:14:09] midbury is that the the the thing you
[00:14:13] want is the most unconvenient thing that
[00:14:15] you could want is is I want to put my
[00:14:18] whole life on hold and do this one
[00:14:19] language but like that is the most
[00:14:22] effective thing you could possibly do
[00:14:23] there's no way you can get that kind of
[00:14:24] like data dump into your head than 24/7
[00:14:28] it's like 247 like you you start
[00:14:29] dreaming in French I started dreaming in
[00:14:31] German my first time uh in 3 weeks with
[00:14:35] zero German background that's crazy I I
[00:14:38] had I mean there were stupid dreams they
[00:14:40] were just like the the table is blue
[00:14:41] like the the worst dreams ever yeah but
[00:14:44] I was dreaming in German at three weeks
[00:14:45] at that point it's like 247 German
[00:14:47] because I'm like there's not you can't
[00:14:49] get more than that um even in terms of
[00:14:51] all this spaced repetition stuff I
[00:14:53] advocate for and all that like I don't
[00:14:55] I'm not actually confident that that
[00:15:00] I'm confident that the the final results
[00:15:02] of that in terms of if you're just going
[00:15:03] to dump yourself in Middlebury let's say
[00:15:05] you have zero German whatever you go to
[00:15:06] Middlebury for German yeah and you dump
[00:15:08] yourself in and you're using my stuff or
[00:15:10] you're just kind of sitting there doing
[00:15:12] whatever I think at the end of the seven
[00:15:14] weeks you're going to be at a similar
[00:15:15] level whether or not you're using really
[00:15:17] efficient based repetition stuff or
[00:15:18] you're just dumping it in because it's
[00:15:20] just it's 247 like you can't do more
[00:15:22] than that it's only after the fact that
[00:15:24] something might you might retain
[00:15:25] something longer yeah um but I guess
[00:15:29] thing to say about Middlebury is that
[00:15:30] because all the students have signed
[00:15:32] these
[00:15:33] contracts um you get a level of
[00:15:35] intensity that you can't get even if you
[00:15:37] go to the countries because I like
[00:15:38] Italian as I said I learned in Italy and
[00:15:40] every you go to class like Italy you can
[00:15:43] find schools where they're super cheap
[00:15:44] and they will give you 30 hours of Class
[00:15:46] A week okay and it's awesome and every
[00:15:49] 50 minutes there's a break to have you
[00:15:51] know espresso because that's
[00:15:52] important and during those 10-minute
[00:15:55] breaks uh everyone is speaking English
[00:15:58] okay yeah yeah and then you break it up
[00:16:00] right there yeah yeah um so this
[00:16:03] Middlebury program is how many weeks or
[00:16:06] how many months depends on the language
[00:16:07] if you're looking at a language uh that
[00:16:10] has uh that uses Latin characters then
[00:16:13] it's seven uh and then the other ones
[00:16:15] they used to be nine now they're eight
[00:16:17] okay and you you go there it's like
[00:16:19] summer camp right you I mean you sleep
[00:16:21] there and are you grouped by the people
[00:16:23] in your class like if you're doing
[00:16:25] German you're only with German speaking
[00:16:27] yes uh you're you're basically Bally not
[00:16:29] allowed to interact with the other
[00:16:30] schools and they have uh like four or
[00:16:34] five cafeterias on campus and they
[00:16:35] offset the lunchtime so that you never
[00:16:37] actually see the other schools for the
[00:16:39] most part except for like breakfast got
[00:16:41] it like they're they're they're clever
[00:16:43] about it like they you really do it's
[00:16:45] it's an immersing experience that is
[00:16:47] really carefully thought out got it so
[00:16:49] if you wanted to go from zero to some
[00:16:53] pretty good fluency in a language you
[00:16:55] would recommend that if you have the
[00:16:56] time and money I guess yeah I mean I
[00:16:59] think they're uh
[00:17:01] they're if you're not if you basically
[00:17:04] just want I I like you just want to show
[00:17:06] up and in the end something happens and
[00:17:07] you basically don't have a choice in the
[00:17:09] matter yeah Middlebury is a great thing
[00:17:12] for that like that's that yes I would I
[00:17:14] feel like that's a big part of the
[00:17:15] problem is people just want to show up
[00:17:18] somewhere and then come out with
[00:17:19] something else obviously there's a lot
[00:17:21] of work that has to be done in there but
[00:17:22] at least you're going there and forced
[00:17:23] to do to do it you know yes yes and it's
[00:17:26] like it's a I think some sometimes
[00:17:28] people need the kick in the butt of just
[00:17:30] like I need to be forced to do this and
[00:17:31] like yeah midbury will force you to do
[00:17:33] it or you will just cry for seven weeks
[00:17:36] yeah um yeah so speaking of putting that
[00:17:39] aside let's talk about your book um tell
[00:17:43] me about the story how it came to be
[00:17:44] because you had your website first um
[00:17:47] when did you decide to develop that
[00:17:49] website first of
[00:17:50] all um after that experience in French
[00:17:53] where I I I realized that like this is
[00:17:55] this is important then I started writing
[00:17:57] about it um
[00:17:59] actually for my Master's thesis I was in
[00:18:02] uh a uh it was a song Masters program um
[00:18:06] in Vienna and I uh I asked them hey can
[00:18:10] I write about language learning and
[00:18:11] they're like yeah sure uh and so I I
[00:18:13] wrote this Master's thesis sort of
[00:18:15] geared towards singers and saying this
[00:18:16] is you know here's how singers should
[00:18:18] learn languages okay um and at the same
[00:18:20] time I was also uh very active on the
[00:18:22] language learning for uh language
[00:18:24] learning subreddit on Reddit yeah okay
[00:18:27] um and people would ask questions like
[00:18:28] hey how do I do this better like hey I'm
[00:18:30] trying to learn French and I I only have
[00:18:31] three months and I'm like I know exactly
[00:18:33] what you should do and so I started
[00:18:35] writing these responses and the
[00:18:36] responses started becoming really long
[00:18:38] it turned into this like I I just sort
[00:18:41] of saved the response that I would give
[00:18:42] to people because it was applicable to
[00:18:44] so many to most questions of just like
[00:18:46] how do I do X um and I kept expanding
[00:18:49] upon it and just uh adding another
[00:18:51] paragraph when someone asked a different
[00:18:52] question and saying like here's what I
[00:18:53] usually say and here's an here's
[00:18:55] addressing your issue and it turns into
[00:18:57] this like three page long
[00:19:00] reply like this is just a really
[00:19:02] obnoxious but useful reply and
[00:19:04] ultimately I started looking at this
[00:19:05] thing being like this is a actually a
[00:19:07] good framework for an article and so I
[00:19:09] started uh I edited it and made it sort
[00:19:11] of nicer and then started sending it to
[00:19:13] people and especially lifehacker.com
[00:19:14] okay oh yeah that's right I remember
[00:19:17] something seeing something there yeah
[00:19:19] and I it took five weeks of contacting
[00:19:22] basically every single person who's ever
[00:19:23] written for life haacker but eventually
[00:19:25] uh I got a response from from one of the
[00:19:27] writers there and she's like like oh
[00:19:29] this is cool I'll post it tomorrow nice
[00:19:31] and she did and then the thing went
[00:19:33] crazy viral I had a publisher offer
[00:19:35] within two hours no way wow it was
[00:19:37] insane was it the same one that you
[00:19:38] actually ended up signing with no it was
[00:19:41] a different publisher but it was enough
[00:19:43] that that because of the publisher offer
[00:19:44] I could call agents in New York that
[00:19:46] night and basically be like hey will you
[00:19:49] please take 15% of money that is already
[00:19:51] on the table and people answer your
[00:19:54] calls at that point so yeah that's
[00:19:57] that's the book kind of happened very
[00:19:58] very suddenly in a kind of unexpected
[00:20:01] way I didn't I mean I didn't realize
[00:20:03] that the life hacker thing would have
[00:20:04] that kind of pull yeah so then you got
[00:20:08] your book deal fluent forever um and so
[00:20:11] tell me about the book um I loved that
[00:20:13] you wrote it really well um I couldn't
[00:20:17] put it down really well done um how do
[00:20:21] you feel about it I mean was it an easy
[00:20:22] process to write are you happy with the
[00:20:24] outcome I'm really happy with the
[00:20:26] outcome it was one of the hardest things
[00:20:27] I've ever done um
[00:20:29] I I wrote that book uh you didn't by
[00:20:32] yourself right no ghost r or anything no
[00:20:35] no no I wrote that myself totally um uh
[00:20:38] I wrote the uh I spent three months no
[00:20:41] probably five months sort of writing
[00:20:42] this first draft of the first three
[00:20:43] chapters um sending and I sent this over
[00:20:46] to my editor and I got sort of no reply
[00:20:48] for a while and I was like all right I
[00:20:51] don't I don't know what this is about
[00:20:52] but I'm going to keep writing and I just
[00:20:53] kept writing and I I eventually and I
[00:20:55] got no nothing back from my agent like I
[00:20:57] said this to her and she likes said
[00:20:58] nothing yeah and I'm just like like
[00:21:01] radio silenced I'm like all right well
[00:21:02] silence is fine I guess I'm going to
[00:21:03] keep writing and I get this letter back
[00:21:05] from my editor it's like this five-page
[00:21:07] long thing basically saying no okay
[00:21:11] absolutely no in fact we're basic like
[00:21:13] if you give me this in the end you we
[00:21:15] will cancel your contract wow okay and
[00:21:20] and like it wasn't just it wasn't mean
[00:21:21] or anything it was brutal and it was
[00:21:23] honest and it was like and and it wasn't
[00:21:25] just like no it written in giant letters
[00:21:27] per P page or something uh but it was it
[00:21:31] was very detailed like this is what
[00:21:32] you're doing wrong this is what you're
[00:21:33] doing wrong this is what you're doing
[00:21:34] wrong everything here is wrong and here
[00:21:36] all the things that are wrong
[00:21:37] specifically and I could go on for
[00:21:39] another 50 pages but I won't wow okay
[00:21:42] fix
[00:21:43] it uh and so uh I learned how to write I
[00:21:47] mean I spent a month basically being
[00:21:48] like Oh okay this is if I don't do this
[00:21:52] I'm screwed yeah uh and so I uh I used
[00:21:57] based repetition I I used a uh I found a
[00:22:00] program not a program a book called
[00:22:01] style lessons and Clarity and Grace just
[00:22:03] a phenomenal yeah uh the for any of your
[00:22:07] listeners who don't know about this
[00:22:08] thing basically it has AB sentences
[00:22:11] sentence a like sentence A and B say the
[00:22:13] same thing but sentence a is good
[00:22:15] sentence B is bad and here let's talk
[00:22:17] about why yeah um super book and so I
[00:22:21] put that in a space repetition program
[00:22:24] uh memorizing every single sentence in
[00:22:26] that book wow uh in terms of I needed to
[00:22:29] look at a sentence uh and know whether
[00:22:31] is this a good version of the sentence
[00:22:33] or a bad version of the sentence and why
[00:22:35] yeah um And I memorized the whole book
[00:22:38] that way wow um and at the same time I
[00:22:40] was reading uh my editor sent me a copy
[00:22:42] of a book that basically he had a
[00:22:44] similar response to originally um it was
[00:22:47] Jay Hendrick's uh thank you for arguing
[00:22:49] it's basically he sent in a book that
[00:22:51] was uh his first draft was basically
[00:22:53] like Nemesis is the Greek you know word
[00:22:56] for this and it means like replying uh
[00:22:59] uh mimicking someone's argument and this
[00:23:01] is like just really crappy to read yeah
[00:23:06] um and my editor sent him the same basic
[00:23:08] thing just being like no like no no no
[00:23:10] no and uh so he wrote rewrote a book
[00:23:13] basically talking about his life and how
[00:23:14] he argues with his kids and how his kids
[00:23:16] win his arguments and why okay and you
[00:23:19] see these little sidebars in each page
[00:23:22] being like by the way my kid just used
[00:23:24] mimesis this is the mimesis okay and
[00:23:28] it's an awesome book and it's the from
[00:23:30] the very first page you're like oh my
[00:23:32] God I have the most nerdy awesome friend
[00:23:34] ever oh and you realize that the book is
[00:23:37] actually about him the book is just is a
[00:23:39] is is a friend that you can meet yeah
[00:23:41] and then it has information in it but
[00:23:42] like that's actually the content of the
[00:23:44] book is is someone that you can relate
[00:23:47] to right and so and that's that's yeah
[00:23:50] that's how you want it to read exactly
[00:23:52] that's I mean that's what you want in a
[00:23:53] book the thing that actually makes you
[00:23:54] turn the page is like hey I want to meet
[00:23:56] this guy more and so after sort of
[00:23:59] memorizing how to do the craft of
[00:24:01] writing through that style book and then
[00:24:02] actually seeing an example of being like
[00:24:04] oh this is actually an enjoyable book to
[00:24:06] read and this is what it's like then I
[00:24:08] rewrote the book and I sent that in that
[00:24:10] took probably another six months or
[00:24:11] eight months or something but I I sent
[00:24:13] in the first three chapters and my
[00:24:15] editor basically who is known to send
[00:24:17] back uh an equal amount of edits as the
[00:24:20] book is in length meaning that like if
[00:24:21] you have a 20,000 word book or draft he
[00:24:24] will send back 20,000 words worth of
[00:24:27] comments on that amazing is what I heard
[00:24:29] from my agent and he sent back a thing
[00:24:31] being like yeah this is good wow okay
[00:24:34] just like that from no being no to sure
[00:24:37] and and so I kept right I finished the
[00:24:39] right the next third and then the next
[00:24:40] third in general he had small comments
[00:24:42] like hey change this you know change the
[00:24:44] title here change that but tiny tiny
[00:24:45] things and then at the end I was
[00:24:47] expecting a 50,000 word edit and he was
[00:24:49] like no this is good I don't want to
[00:24:50] mess with it and so that was the writing
[00:24:53] process it was uh I mean kind of brutal
[00:24:56] yeah yeah it's it's not an easy process
[00:24:59] you did it all by yourself I I have a
[00:25:01] book that's been written I had to deal
[00:25:03] with it it got shelves for whatever
[00:25:06] reason um but I had somebody help me
[00:25:09] write it and that helped a lot but it
[00:25:10] was still already pretty freaking hard
[00:25:13] uh so I can just imagine yeah it's
[00:25:14] brutal this thing is it's it's not an
[00:25:16] easy thing to do yeah I'm glad I'm not
[00:25:18] doing that right now yeah are you so you
[00:25:21] then did a Kickstarter right what was
[00:25:24] the reason of that if if uh is that the
[00:25:26] publishing company that asked you to do
[00:25:27] that it was no I uh the first draft of
[00:25:31] the book The the reason that it was like
[00:25:33] so brutal is that I the first thing I
[00:25:36] suggest people learn is learn
[00:25:37] pronunciation and the example I usually
[00:25:40] site is this uh Hungarian
[00:25:42] word which is the word for camera and
[00:25:45] it's impossible to remember because it's
[00:25:47] gibberish yeah like you can remember for
[00:25:49] all of zero seconds um and if you know
[00:25:52] all the sounds in Hungarian like that's
[00:25:54] then that's a word it's like you know
[00:25:55] here's a word that I can now remember um
[00:25:59] and the problem is that my background
[00:26:00] was oh how do you learn pronunciation oh
[00:26:02] you just get a a bachelor's degree in
[00:26:04] Opera and like that's not something it
[00:26:06] is portable you can't be like hey anyone
[00:26:08] who wants to learn language go go get a
[00:26:09] bachelor's degree I can't sing no right
[00:26:13] like and so I I I wrote this chapter the
[00:26:16] very first chapter was like the
[00:26:18] epiglottal frickative is made in the
[00:26:20] back of your throat with the you know
[00:26:21] the EULA like even behind the like just
[00:26:23] this awful thing yeah trying to kind of
[00:26:27] like throw something out there just
[00:26:29] being like I don't know what to do for
[00:26:30] people who don't have this background
[00:26:31] like get this background I'll give it to
[00:26:33] you like here's all the data that's in
[00:26:34] my head here
[00:26:37] and after sort of like my editor gave me
[00:26:40] this question he was like dude like I
[00:26:41] have I have a Malaysian supermodel that
[00:26:44] I'm dating in five hours and I need to
[00:26:47] impress her what the hell do I
[00:26:49] do and I started sort of researching the
[00:26:52] answer that question like how do you
[00:26:53] what do you do here like practically
[00:26:54] speaking you go on YouTube and you spend
[00:26:56] five hours trying to learn one word
[00:26:57] really well sure but but like if you
[00:27:00] really want to get those sounds down
[00:27:01] like there's actually research showing
[00:27:02] exactly how to do
[00:27:04] it and no one's done anything with it
[00:27:06] and I like looked at this re it's it's
[00:27:08] the research on training Japanese adults
[00:27:09] how to hear the difference between rock
[00:27:11] and lock oh yeah I remember you writing
[00:27:13] about this and like the research is
[00:27:16] really impressive like they they did
[00:27:18] three hours of training and they managed
[00:27:20] to bump them from from 50% accuracy up
[00:27:23] to 80% accuracy like
[00:27:25] permanently and no one had done anything
[00:27:27] with this research and so I I sort of
[00:27:29] made a little version of it in my in in
[00:27:31] Anki in the space repetition stuff where
[00:27:33] I use because you can make an do almost
[00:27:35] anything and uh and I did this for
[00:27:38] Hungarian as a test case and I found
[00:27:39] that after 10 days of 20 minutes a day I
[00:27:42] had better Hungarian pronunciation and
[00:27:44] better my ears were better trained in
[00:27:45] Hungarian than a a half semester of
[00:27:48] French in in college okay and after that
[00:27:51] it was like this is stupid like this
[00:27:53] must exist the idea that this tool
[00:27:55] doesn't exist when it's that easy right
[00:27:58] is ridiculous and so that that sort of
[00:28:00] was the idea of the kickstarter and also
[00:28:02] uh then it was sort of like hey
[00:28:04] publisher I'm going to go do this thing
[00:28:06] can you like you know tweet about it
[00:28:07] like whatever and and that's that's kind
[00:28:09] of where that went nice so let's let's
[00:28:11] talk a bit about what's in the book um
[00:28:13] starting with the pronunciation so let's
[00:28:16] take an example I'm going to use my
[00:28:17] fiance again she's going to hate me for
[00:28:19] this but she speaks a bit of French what
[00:28:21] she learned what she remembers not very
[00:28:23] much but her accent is that typical
[00:28:26] American sounding French accent that
[00:28:28] just like you don't want to speak that
[00:28:31] over there nobody's going to speak back
[00:28:32] to you in French in France um so if she
[00:28:35] just wanted to work on pronunciation of
[00:28:37] words and anybody else who's in that
[00:28:39] same boat what should she do what's
[00:28:41] what's kind of the approach to take the
[00:28:43] thing that that that people Miss in
[00:28:44] terms of pronunciation is that they they
[00:28:47] usually when you try to teach
[00:28:48] pronunciation you teach mouth stuff okay
[00:28:50] and you're like okay if you want to say
[00:28:51] the word you know suit then you need to
[00:28:54] have like an oo mouth position but a
[00:28:56] like an e tongue position
[00:28:58] and like that's all true and that's
[00:29:00] useful information if you can actually
[00:29:03] hear the sound suit that's true right
[00:29:05] which your fiance probably can't can't
[00:29:07] distinguish it yeah yeah and so in terms
[00:29:10] of the the very first ingredient of good
[00:29:13] pronunciation is actually ear training
[00:29:15] and that's the part that's usually
[00:29:16] missing and it's missing because it's
[00:29:18] hard like ear training we're our ears
[00:29:20] are sort of set at the age of one to our
[00:29:23] native languages from what you hear all
[00:29:25] around you growing up exactly yeah you
[00:29:27] just pick up whatever whatever is
[00:29:28] happening what the the the sort of sound
[00:29:30] environment between the ages of 6 months
[00:29:32] and 12 months like that's all the sort
[00:29:33] of data you got and then at at 12 months
[00:29:37] your brain basically is like okay well
[00:29:39] here's what where I'm living I'm going
[00:29:41] to stop listening to all that other
[00:29:42] stuff like like a baby of of uh your
[00:29:44] fiance at five months could absolutely
[00:29:47] hear the difference between soup and
[00:29:49] S absolutely yeah but she lost that
[00:29:52] ability at 12 months sure because no one
[00:29:54] was saying around her um and if you just
[00:29:56] sort of give some an exposure like an
[00:29:59] adult exposure to those sounds and
[00:30:02] say uh they're still not going to pick
[00:30:04] it up okay but if you force them to do
[00:30:07] to to take tests basically where you're
[00:30:09] like I'm going to say one of these two
[00:30:11] words and you tell me which one I did is
[00:30:13] this the weird French one or is this the
[00:30:14] other weird French one or is this an
[00:30:16] English one like there's there's su su
[00:30:19] and Su like there's three different
[00:30:21] sounds we're talking about yeah um tell
[00:30:24] me which one I said and basically you
[00:30:26] you start doing these randomized tests
[00:30:27] you're just like suit which one was it
[00:30:29] you have options a b or c yeah and it
[00:30:32] doesn't matter if she gets it wrong or
[00:30:33] right it just she has to guess she's
[00:30:35] training it yeah and you have to tell
[00:30:37] her whether she got it right or wrong
[00:30:39] the feedback yeah the feedback is also
[00:30:41] key like without the feedback she won't
[00:30:42] learn anything either um but you do that
[00:30:45] and you do that basically three hours
[00:30:46] and you'll learn a sound okay and that's
[00:30:48] doesn't have to be three hours over you
[00:30:50] know a in a single session that could be
[00:30:53] in fact it's actually less than three
[00:30:54] hours from my experience but like it
[00:30:57] goes quick
[00:30:58] uh and so if you're running into sounds
[00:31:01] you can't hear then you need to do that
[00:31:03] kind of testing um one of the things
[00:31:05] that you can do practically like I I
[00:31:07] have some guides on my website in terms
[00:31:08] of just like how do you actually make
[00:31:10] these tests in a computer right yeah but
[00:31:12] and that's useful and if you're if
[00:31:14] you're sort of computer inclined and
[00:31:15] stuff like yeah absolutely do that uh if
[00:31:17] if you want sort of prepackaged stuff
[00:31:19] that's also available on website but if
[00:31:20] you're not going to use my stuff which
[00:31:22] is fine go to a
[00:31:24] tutor say words in front of them or your
[00:31:26] fiance can go to you and say words uh
[00:31:29] and what the the most useful ones of
[00:31:31] these sort of differentiation exercises
[00:31:33] these are called they're minimal pair
[00:31:34] exercises what they're called Su versus
[00:31:36] Su that's a minimal pair things that
[00:31:38] sound very similar except for one sound
[00:31:40] um you have her repeat a word and she
[00:31:42] goes something like like bonj right
[00:31:46] you're like let's just talk about that
[00:31:47] first part say Bon like say the word
[00:31:49] you're saying she's like Bon and you're
[00:31:51] like okay I'm hearing Bon and I want B
[00:31:55] right so let's start comparing those
[00:31:57] things like try saying bone and she
[00:32:00] she's not going to be able to go all the
[00:32:01] way to Bone she's going to go something
[00:32:03] like uh bone right and I'm like it's
[00:32:07] it's a little closer and then you start
[00:32:09] making making those exercises with what
[00:32:11] she's doing now now you go okay you're
[00:32:13] saying B and I want
[00:32:16] B okay but it's a slight of refinements
[00:32:20] yeah yeah and and you start forcing her
[00:32:23] to uh basically tell you am I
[00:32:24] impersonating you or am I doing it right
[00:32:27] right okay and that's a way you can kind
[00:32:29] of immediately form these kinds of
[00:32:31] minimal pairs without having to like
[00:32:32] find a list of them or something like
[00:32:34] that okay so that I mean that that's the
[00:32:37] thing and then once you have that down
[00:32:38] once your ears can hear it the
[00:32:40] pronunciation comes pretty much
[00:32:41] naturally uh you can get a little bit of
[00:32:44] better pronunciation with these sorts of
[00:32:46] discussions of oh put your mouth in the
[00:32:47] O position put your tongue in the E
[00:32:49] position like that kind of data starts
[00:32:51] becoming useful only when your ears are
[00:32:53] actually on it when they can actually
[00:32:55] hear cool and you have this you have
[00:32:57] some some of these prepackaged things
[00:32:59] available on your website you've put
[00:33:00] these together uh yes we finished 10
[00:33:02] languages so far uh we're doing the last
[00:33:04] four right now but but pretty much if
[00:33:05] it's a language that is generally
[00:33:07] learned it's probably on our site cool
[00:33:09] okay nice so that's the pronunciation
[00:33:12] then what do you get into in your book
[00:33:13] what's kind of the the next steps the
[00:33:16] next step after you have some sense of
[00:33:17] what the sounds basically the next step
[00:33:19] after you can hear the language is that
[00:33:21] you start learning words uh and you
[00:33:22] start learning words that are uh
[00:33:25] basically that don't require translation
[00:33:28] meaning that you're learning words that
[00:33:29] are easily learnable through pictures
[00:33:31] got it yeah and there's lots of really
[00:33:32] useful words like that like like table
[00:33:34] and chair and person and man and woman
[00:33:37] like all these things are things that
[00:33:38] don't actually require you to know the
[00:33:40] English word or have the English word on
[00:33:41] the backside of flashcards or something
[00:33:43] like you can actually take a picture of
[00:33:45] a cat like that's a thing that exists
[00:33:47] yeah um and so I have a list of 625
[00:33:51] words that I generally recommend people
[00:33:52] learn first because they're very very
[00:33:54] high frequency words like you can also
[00:33:55] learn watermelon but like that was not
[00:33:57] going to
[00:33:58] help unless watermelon is like your
[00:34:00] favorite thing in the world in which
[00:34:01] case you can always add vocabulary but
[00:34:03] like there's a base vocabulary that used
[00:34:06] pretty much universally and that covers
[00:34:08] usually what is it 70 something per of
[00:34:11] of spoken language it varies I'm sure
[00:34:13] but it varies a bit uh usually when you
[00:34:15] talk about these kind of percentages
[00:34:16] you're talking about a frequency list
[00:34:18] that's geared towards that particular
[00:34:19] language and you're talking about the
[00:34:20] top thousand uh and or the top 10 or the
[00:34:23] top 100 things like that with the
[00:34:25] English example I think it's something
[00:34:26] like uh the top 10 words uh are in some
[00:34:30] sense useless because they're all
[00:34:31] grammatical words but that's like uh 25%
[00:34:34] of the language like just the word the'
[00:34:37] is is I think 5% of the English language
[00:34:39] in terms of what you encounter but not
[00:34:40] very useful you being able to recognize
[00:34:42] every the' in a sense um then the top
[00:34:44] 100 words are around 50% of the language
[00:34:46] the top thousand words are around 72% of
[00:34:48] the language and then uh the top 2,000
[00:34:50] words are around 80% uh and if those are
[00:34:53] for reading percentages if they're
[00:34:55] spoken it's actually the percentages are
[00:34:56] higher because we use a smaller
[00:34:57] vocabulary for spoken Mak sense okay um
[00:34:59] but with the top 625 like nouns
[00:35:02] basically and and and visual adjectives
[00:35:04] like blue and green and things like that
[00:35:06] and verbs like you know to walk to run
[00:35:10] to to to eat these kinds of things where
[00:35:11] you can also have pictures of people
[00:35:13] eating um with that what's what's
[00:35:15] practically going to happen is that if
[00:35:17] you open up a grammar book you're going
[00:35:18] to know most of the characters in that
[00:35:19] sentence if you have something like the
[00:35:21] the dog eats meat like you're going to
[00:35:24] know the word dog you're going to know
[00:35:25] the word eats and you're going to know
[00:35:26] the to eat you're going know the word
[00:35:29] meat right and so at that point if you
[00:35:32] know all those words then the grammar
[00:35:33] becomes how do I tell the story about
[00:35:35] dogs meet and eating and then grammar
[00:35:37] becomes a lot more uh something you can
[00:35:40] actually uh grab in a much more concrete
[00:35:43] way in the sense that you're like okay I
[00:35:44] know all the characters now I'm just
[00:35:45] focusing on grammar instead of words
[00:35:47] yeah uh yeah one of the things I loved
[00:35:50] about you describing how to learn and
[00:35:52] how to go about learning the vocab is is
[00:35:55] just putting the picture right I mean
[00:35:56] most people will put we'll make a flash
[00:35:58] card with the word in the language and
[00:36:00] on the other side the word in English
[00:36:02] and uh often when I'm explaining how I
[00:36:05] memorize numbers or cards or whatever is
[00:36:08] you know I have a number I have a card
[00:36:10] which at some point yeah I had to give
[00:36:11] it a translation to an English word But
[00:36:14] ultimately my goal is to look at that
[00:36:17] card say and see the picture immediately
[00:36:20] like that word is the picture forget the
[00:36:22] step where you translate it to the word
[00:36:24] that's just another step right so why
[00:36:26] learn vocab comparing it to English when
[00:36:29] ultimately you just want to see or think
[00:36:31] of an object or a thing you want to say
[00:36:32] and it's immediately that word right in
[00:36:35] that language yeah so I thought that was
[00:36:38] fascinating so when you're making flash
[00:36:39] cards just put the picture of the thing
[00:36:41] you want and the word in the other
[00:36:42] language rather than the English right
[00:36:45] the other thing that's important there
[00:36:47] is that like we have this feeling that
[00:36:49] like a dog is a dog is a dog like that
[00:36:51] the dog in French and the dog in German
[00:36:53] and a dog in it's just dog that's dog
[00:36:55] and like and like that's sort of true
[00:36:57] like yes there is a creature that is
[00:36:59] called a dog and like it's called
[00:37:00] different things in different languages
[00:37:01] but
[00:37:02] like we're not good at remembering
[00:37:05] copies of
[00:37:06] things like just knowing that this is
[00:37:08] the word for that like that's data that
[00:37:10] that from my standpoint and I think from
[00:37:12] a general sort of Neuroscience
[00:37:14] standpoint your brain is like I don't
[00:37:15] care right like why do I need six words
[00:37:17] for the same
[00:37:18] thing and but as if you for instance
[00:37:22] search on Google Images for
[00:37:24] sh you're going to find that the French
[00:37:26] are choosing different different
[00:37:27] pictures on their blogs than Americans
[00:37:30] are yeah or than English speaking people
[00:37:32] are and like that kind of Distinction
[00:37:34] where you're like oh French dogs are
[00:37:36] kind of
[00:37:37] smaller and they tend to be like do bike
[00:37:41] poodles yeah like there's the
[00:37:43] differences and like those kind of
[00:37:45] differences are are actually memorable
[00:37:47] where you're like this isn't just the
[00:37:48] word for dog this is sh and it means
[00:37:50] something a little bit different little
[00:37:52] yeah and like we've all had this
[00:37:54] experience of like like I've had people
[00:37:56] come to me and they're like yeah yeah
[00:37:57] but I'm really I'm bad at remembering
[00:37:59] words or I'm bad at remembering like
[00:38:01] names of things and stuff like that I'm
[00:38:02] like okay well what's your favorite food
[00:38:06] in you know in in Amsterdam or something
[00:38:10] yeah and they'll like say the word
[00:38:11] immediately they're like oh it's this
[00:38:12] thing yeah like they know exactly the
[00:38:14] word for this in the language and stuff
[00:38:15] and I'm like why how many times did you
[00:38:18] study that word how many times did you
[00:38:19] look the translation of that up in the
[00:38:20] dictionary they're like oh no I just I
[00:38:22] saw it on the menu and I ate it and it
[00:38:23] was good yeah and it's because it's
[00:38:25] something new like we're really good or
[00:38:27] remembering new things like everyone
[00:38:28] knows the word for like burrito and
[00:38:30] things like that like like these are
[00:38:31] things that that uh or oata like this
[00:38:34] the rice drink you're like it's orchata
[00:38:36] of course it tastes good so I I know I
[00:38:38] remember it but like remembering like
[00:38:40] that that orchata means rice drink like
[00:38:43] that's who cares like rice drink like
[00:38:46] that that that kind of translation is
[00:38:47] useless uh so so trying to find things
[00:38:49] that make these words unique and new
[00:38:52] that's something that actually sticks
[00:38:53] and so in terms of these pictures uh
[00:38:55] generally I I push people towards
[00:38:57] searching in the languages on Google
[00:38:58] Images yeah when their language is
[00:39:00] something that shows up online uh
[00:39:02] because it actually it just forces you
[00:39:04] to see like they're choosing different
[00:39:06] stuff than you would choose and that's
[00:39:07] important because now it's a New Concept
[00:39:10] yeah and I think you mentioned uh it's
[00:39:12] not so much just putting Shia in
[00:39:14] google.com I think you have to change a
[00:39:16] setting right so that it actually
[00:39:18] searches in French Google or or
[00:39:20] something like that or does it matter
[00:39:22] there's some settings you can it it you
[00:39:24] can just search in terms of just the
[00:39:25] picture part you can absolutely just
[00:39:26] search on images.google.com and you'll
[00:39:28] get all that stuff um the the cool thing
[00:39:30] about Google is that if you mess with
[00:39:32] some settings you can actually get
[00:39:33] little French like like blurbs
[00:39:35] underneath of using that word in context
[00:39:37] oh I see okay which is just gold uh
[00:39:39] Google's changed those settings somewhat
[00:39:41] now that that you could still access it
[00:39:43] but the the sentences are shorter okay
[00:39:45] so you're only getting like a six-word
[00:39:46] or or eight-word blurb instead of like a
[00:39:48] whole awesome sentence yeah uh so
[00:39:50] they're becoming it's a little less
[00:39:52] useful than it used to be but it's still
[00:39:54] aome I mean you're seeing example
[00:39:57] phrases basically all the time for any
[00:39:59] word you want got it so what you
[00:40:01] recommend is is start with a word set in
[00:40:03] this case you have I think you also have
[00:40:05] these prepackage as well 625 words um in
[00:40:08] your target language um and you want to
[00:40:11] make some type of flash card and I think
[00:40:13] you are a big fan of ani which is a uh
[00:40:16] an app I don't is it on the iPhone can
[00:40:19] you get it on your phone yes okay um uh
[00:40:22] it's great to to to build out these
[00:40:24] flashcards and what's cool about it is
[00:40:25] it it does helps you with the space
[00:40:26] repetition ition right which is helping
[00:40:29] you remember the ones that you forget
[00:40:30] more frequently and reminding you of
[00:40:31] ones that you haven't maybe looked at in
[00:40:33] a while um right am I right yes
[00:40:36] absolutely yeah okay so once you have
[00:40:39] those words learned um obviously you can
[00:40:41] always add more words as you get deeper
[00:40:43] into the language but the next step
[00:40:45] obviously is putting them together right
[00:40:49] the and that's the grammar so what what
[00:40:51] are the what what's the next thing
[00:40:54] what's I mean is it just sitting down
[00:40:55] and learning it uh is it it's just
[00:40:57] trying to listen to it and speak it put
[00:40:59] yourself in situations where you're
[00:41:01] going to speak it what is it um
[00:41:05] you're this is going back to that um the
[00:41:07] the you know the dog eats meat idea um
[00:41:10] where if you if you know the charact you
[00:41:12] like you've already taught yourself how
[00:41:13] to learn simple things you've taught
[00:41:15] yourself how to learn things that you
[00:41:16] can picture and so even if you don't
[00:41:18] know meat like you can make a flash card
[00:41:20] for that now now you practiced 625 times
[00:41:22] like how to learn things like meat yeah
[00:41:24] so okay you know dog you know eats to
[00:41:26] eat and you know meat but the idea of
[00:41:29] the in the beginning of that sentence
[00:41:31] the dog eats meat right the idea of eats
[00:41:34] which is now not to eat this is
[00:41:36] something else um the idea that that
[00:41:38] meat is at the end of the sentence and
[00:41:39] dog is in the beginning of the sentence
[00:41:41] those are all new chunks of data that
[00:41:44] you also need to get into your brain
[00:41:45] right and so what you the sort of way
[00:41:48] you bring in grammar is you're still
[00:41:50] using ankey you're still using a flash
[00:41:52] card system but you're you're going into
[00:41:55] the actual language in use uh whether
[00:41:57] through a grammar textbook or through a
[00:41:58] tutor or whatever and you're finding
[00:42:01] example stories that you can also
[00:42:03] picture and you get this picture of a
[00:42:06] dog eating meat okay in your head and
[00:42:08] you get this example sentence and it's
[00:42:10] translated you're like okay the dog eats
[00:42:11] meat and you get it back and your like
[00:42:13] I'm trying to learn English let's say
[00:42:15] I'm a Spanish speaker I I see the
[00:42:16] translation in Spanish and I'm like okay
[00:42:17] I understand what's going on here uh I I
[00:42:20] understand the picture um at that point
[00:42:22] then you can go in and you can start
[00:42:24] doing fill-in-the blank
[00:42:25] sentences and so if if you have uh you
[00:42:28] know eats like what is eats what does
[00:42:30] eats look like compared to to eat well
[00:42:33] eats look like a looks like a dog eating
[00:42:35] meat like this like the dog eats meat
[00:42:37] that's the word that fits in that slot
[00:42:38] and so if you have a a sentence like the
[00:42:40] dog blank meat and under that sentence
[00:42:44] you have to eat this is some kind of
[00:42:46] special form of to eat that fits in that
[00:42:47] slot yeah and then you have a picture of
[00:42:49] a dog eating meat like you're like okay
[00:42:53] well this is this is something I can
[00:42:54] actually use to help me remember eats
[00:42:56] yeah
[00:42:58] uh and you can do that for for
[00:43:00] completely abstract words like the' you
[00:43:02] can do that for things like and you can
[00:43:03] do that like this is you know the boy
[00:43:05] and the girl were walking together like
[00:43:07] the story like the picture of what does
[00:43:09] an and look like well an and looks like
[00:43:10] the boy blank the girl and the the boy
[00:43:13] blank a girl are walking together and a
[00:43:16] picture of a girl and a boy holding
[00:43:18] hands like and in this case is for that
[00:43:20] sentence yeah just two people holding
[00:43:23] hands walking together and so that's a
[00:43:26] way to sort sort of uh take really
[00:43:28] really abstract things that are
[00:43:29] generally really hard to remember uh and
[00:43:32] make them extremely concrete cuz like
[00:43:34] this picture of a boy and a girl walking
[00:43:35] together like that's that's a story you
[00:43:37] you can easily remember and can see yeah
[00:43:40] so you're not you don't necessarily say
[00:43:43] think that people should sit down and
[00:43:44] like look at these grammar books and
[00:43:46] just memorize all the conjugations of
[00:43:48] all the verbs I mean at some point you
[00:43:50] kind of need to know those right you'd
[00:43:52] learn them though through example the
[00:43:54] the the kind of idea of I'm going to
[00:43:55] memorize this chart
[00:43:57] where the chart is not connected to
[00:43:59] stories yeah is the kind of abstract
[00:44:01] data that is is you're basically
[00:44:02] learning about a language rather than
[00:44:04] learning the language yeah uh and so if
[00:44:07] you you what you have to do in some
[00:44:09] sense is you need to connect those
[00:44:11] things to actual use and the way you do
[00:44:13] that is by taking a chart like that and
[00:44:15] taking that to a tutor if your book
[00:44:16] doesn't provide it and saying I need an
[00:44:18] example sentence for every single one of
[00:44:20] these conjugations for at least one verb
[00:44:23] sure in each sort of type of conjugation
[00:44:25] I need one and I need different stories
[00:44:27] they can't just be you know the boy eats
[00:44:30] they like I eat he eats she eats like
[00:44:32] that is not a story like he eats a pizza
[00:44:35] you know she eats you know the the best
[00:44:38] pasta in the world like like he like
[00:44:40] they are eating you know ice cream and
[00:44:43] the pictures need to be different the
[00:44:45] subjects need to be different every
[00:44:46] story needs to be at least somewhat
[00:44:47] unique you learn them that way and
[00:44:50] they're going to stick and then they're
[00:44:51] also going to be uh useful in the sense
[00:44:54] that the next time you run into a word
[00:44:55] like jump
[00:44:58] if you've learned eats in that kind of
[00:45:00] with that kind of uh complexity and that
[00:45:02] kind of depth then the idea being able
[00:45:05] to say Okay jump goes to jumps is
[00:45:08] something you'll be able to do whereas
[00:45:09] just sort of memorizing like charts and
[00:45:11] stuff is is is not that applicable yeah
[00:45:14] and and that that goes back to
[00:45:15] everything I I try to teach in terms of
[00:45:17] memory is you know you're looking at
[00:45:19] something abstract a chart or a list of
[00:45:21] something that you don't deal with on a
[00:45:23] daily basis it means nothing to you yet
[00:45:25] um that's going to be hard to remember
[00:45:28] but if you turn it into a story or a
[00:45:29] picture something that Associates the
[00:45:32] things that you already know it just
[00:45:34] sticks that's that's the whole key to
[00:45:35] memorization so I love that I love that
[00:45:37] approach um you don't really hear that
[00:45:40] ever when learning a language but that's
[00:45:42] that's that's the that's the magic right
[00:45:44] there right well I mean that's that's
[00:45:46] why everyone keeps having this
[00:45:47] experience of going to classes and not
[00:45:48] learning anything exactly yeah I so that
[00:45:52] and then so I guess the final step is is
[00:45:54] once you've done all that is to use the
[00:45:56] language to it it immerse yourself as
[00:45:58] possible and obviously that's hard um
[00:46:01] for different people uh where depending
[00:46:03] where they are how much free time they
[00:46:05] have but you know that's you could watch
[00:46:07] the news online in that language or
[00:46:09] listen to podcasts or speak with your
[00:46:11] friends or or just go to meetups stuff
[00:46:14] like that right but you have that's
[00:46:15] where you have to kind of make the
[00:46:16] effort afterwards because you're not
[00:46:17] going to learn a language just by
[00:46:19] studying it's I think most of it
[00:46:21] honestly will come from speaking it and
[00:46:24] and immersing yourself right you can get
[00:46:26] very very far with just studying uh
[00:46:29] meaning that that you can actually get
[00:46:30] to a point where you're thinking in that
[00:46:32] language with on your own uh or with the
[00:46:36] help of like a a tutor but like a tutor
[00:46:37] once a week maybe uh like that's
[00:46:40] something that is actually doable um but
[00:46:43] yes there are these skills you know
[00:46:44] Reading Writing listening and reading uh
[00:46:46] Reading Writing listening and uh
[00:46:49] speaking there we go um you know those
[00:46:51] are individual skills that can be worked
[00:46:52] on individually that have to be worked
[00:46:54] on individually meaning that that you
[00:46:56] can train listening but only by forcing
[00:46:57] yourself to listen to content that's
[00:46:59] difficult yeah and like that's the only
[00:47:01] thing that's going to make that get
[00:47:02] better you can train speaking but only
[00:47:04] by talking about things that are hard to
[00:47:05] talk about where you don't have all the
[00:47:06] words like there's there's those are
[00:47:08] specific things but that said you can
[00:47:10] actually uh get to a point where you're
[00:47:13] thinking in full sentences in a language
[00:47:16] without sort of immersing yourself uh
[00:47:19] and the immersion step is actually
[00:47:21] becoming extremely easy uh in terms of
[00:47:24] um just accessibility like right I have
[00:47:27] I have this Hungarian tutor uh and a
[00:47:29] Japanese tutor and we're chatting for an
[00:47:31] hour a week and the I think I'm paying
[00:47:34] like four bucks an hour that's crazy
[00:47:37] it's crazy and like from from their
[00:47:39] standpoint it's kind of like ah I I'm
[00:47:41] getting to chat with someone and it's
[00:47:42] fun yeah and that's and I'm getting paid
[00:47:44] for it and I'm in my pajamas like from
[00:47:47] their standpoint it's like I'm getting I
[00:47:49] would do this anyway because it's kind
[00:47:50] of fun but like this is the
[00:47:52] accessibility we have now at this point
[00:47:54] if you want to talk to a native speaker
[00:47:56] exclusive exclusively in their language
[00:47:57] and without having to spend half an hour
[00:47:59] you know we're going to exchange English
[00:48:00] and Spanish which is like an awesome
[00:48:01] thing but even if you if you don't want
[00:48:03] to spend that half hour speaking in
[00:48:04] English like you can get that for $4 to
[00:48:07] $6 an hour which is insane what's this
[00:48:10] what's the service you use is it a
[00:48:12] specific website I I use italki.com i t
[00:48:15] a l k i okay that's crazy it's crazy
[00:48:19] it's amazing and like it like it ends up
[00:48:21] being almost cheaper just to sort of sit
[00:48:24] at home and chat with people than to do
[00:48:26] almost anything else and are they tutors
[00:48:28] like can they correct you and stuff or
[00:48:30] are they just speaking their language uh
[00:48:32] you get both you can you can sort of
[00:48:33] choose what you want um I generally
[00:48:35] actually prefer the people who are not
[00:48:36] tutors okay because the tutors generally
[00:48:39] have a curriculum they're just like this
[00:48:40] is what we're going to do and at this
[00:48:42] point I I I know what I'm looking for
[00:48:44] and what I'm really looking for is just
[00:48:45] I I need a native speaker
[00:48:48] who I can just ask questions from and
[00:48:51] who will will ideally if if I'm actually
[00:48:54] pretty experienced in the language I'm
[00:48:55] looking for a native speaker who doesn't
[00:48:56] have good English yeah yeah okay that's
[00:48:59] yeah of
[00:49:00] course very cool very cool stuff so
[00:49:03] we've talked almost for 50 minutes here
[00:49:05] but um just uh would love to know what
[00:49:07] are you working on now what's next uh
[00:49:11] yeah are you writing another book
[00:49:12] probably sound like you weren't not
[00:49:14] right now I mean I'm I'm thinking about
[00:49:16] it it's I sort of have a even though it
[00:49:19] is a lot of work I I I learned to kind
[00:49:20] of love writing but um the I would say
[00:49:23] right now the main focus is finishing
[00:49:25] that Kickstarter uh it's
[00:49:27] I started it three years ago and we
[00:49:28] ended up promising uh 65 products yeah
[00:49:32] and it it is insane and so we're on our
[00:49:34] last four languages and then I need to
[00:49:35] do all of those again uh for people
[00:49:38] learning English so SP like English for
[00:49:40] Spanish speakers English for French
[00:49:41] speakers English for Hungarian speakers
[00:49:43] um but that product will take a lot less
[00:49:45] time than than the original work um once
[00:49:48] the kickstarter is done uh I think the
[00:49:50] big next goal is going to be creating a
[00:49:53] a new app um there's there's we're
[00:49:56] starting to look at the idea of creating
[00:49:57] a space repetition app that um is really
[00:50:00] geared towards language learning and
[00:50:01] allows you to uh sort of take sentences
[00:50:04] out in the wild and dump them into your
[00:50:06] head which is one thing that's missing
[00:50:07] in anky like the idea if I'm looking if
[00:50:09] I'm at a restaurant and I see some
[00:50:10] awesome food and I'm like hey waiter
[00:50:11] what is this thing that should be able
[00:50:13] to go in my flashcard system from my
[00:50:15] phone rather than me having to write
[00:50:17] down the word go home and then create
[00:50:18] flash cards on my computer yeah I agree
[00:50:21] okay so cool and what's uh what's are
[00:50:23] you planning on learning more languages
[00:50:25] is there one that you're dying to to
[00:50:26] learn are you working on other than
[00:50:28] Japanese Japanese was the one I've
[00:50:30] always wanted to learn and so that's
[00:50:32] that's sort of been my my big priority
[00:50:33] now um January
[00:50:36] through my wedding in June is going to
[00:50:38] be Spanish Spanish Spanish yeah uh and
[00:50:40] then probably I'll go back to Japanese
[00:50:42] uh for a bit okay that's very cool one
[00:50:45] last question who is your
[00:50:47] favorite polyglot I mean you're a
[00:50:49] polyglot now did you ever think you'd be
[00:50:51] a polyglot not really no um that's a
[00:50:54] cool title I guess so yeah people are
[00:50:57] like what's
[00:50:59] that sometimes it's on my business card
[00:51:01] they're like polyl what is that um
[00:51:04] favorite polyglot gosh
[00:51:06] um I don't know if I keep up on am I I I
[00:51:09] I remember seeing the study schedule of
[00:51:12] uh I don't know how you pronounce his
[00:51:13] last name Alexander Alo okay yeah yeah I
[00:51:16] think I'm not a big I don't know many
[00:51:18] people either but I was just curious if
[00:51:20] yeah I I don't keep up but I remember
[00:51:21] looking at his his schedule which was
[00:51:23] something like like six hours a day I've
[00:51:24] studied I was I've been I was super
[00:51:26] impressed that I was just like wowow
[00:51:28] like you are dedicated in the way that I
[00:51:29] am absolutely not yeah yeah okay very
[00:51:33] cool well look thank you so much for
[00:51:35] taking the time um I know language is
[00:51:38] always one of those things that
[00:51:40] everybody would love to learn French or
[00:51:42] Italian they that's like everybody would
[00:51:44] say that um and would love to but it's
[00:51:46] not always something that they can just
[00:51:48] do um or they think they can do they
[00:51:50] actually can but um you make it very um
[00:51:54] accessible and easy to to approach So

[00:00:30] thank you so much for being uh on this
[00:00:32] podcast SL show U this everybody this is
[00:00:36] Art Benjamin uh if you haven't seen his
[00:00:39] Ted Talk it's how many hits does that
[00:00:42] have it's one of the top 10 or something
[00:00:43] right I've done three TED Talks that
[00:00:45] have collectively earned about 12
[00:00:48] million hits my most popular one has
[00:00:50] about 8 million and math Magic's one
[00:00:53] right yeah and I think it's in the top
[00:00:54] 20 or so at one point it was in the top
[00:00:57] five it was like fourth I was very
[00:00:59] excited but
[00:01:00] um I'm still I'm still excited to see
[00:01:02] that people are enjoying what I do yeah
[00:01:05] it's that I mean i' you have a lot of
[00:01:07] talks online that I've I've nerdily
[00:01:10] looked and watched um I apologize no no
[00:01:13] no I mainly for to watch the five digit
[00:01:16] squaring I love that part um but the the
[00:01:19] one you did for Ted is just like spoton
[00:01:22] your on Q like as a speaker I think you
[00:01:25] just nailed it um and it's 15 minutes
[00:01:27] it's perfect length I had a my best
[00:01:29] friend
[00:01:30] messaged me a week ago showing me your
[00:01:33] video and he's like have you seen this
[00:01:34] and I was like oh my God have I seen
[00:01:36] that I'm talking to the guy next week
[00:01:38] nice yeah so I mean when did you do that
[00:01:42] that was 2005 it was taped in 2005 it
[00:01:46] was released online at the end of 2007
[00:01:48] and it then it went viral yeah yeah
[00:01:50] because I mean did people know of you
[00:01:53] before that or I mean I was um I'd say
[00:01:58] be before that
[00:02:01] I was known in the math Community yeah
[00:02:03] as a guy that did Magic and mental
[00:02:05] Mental Math um I would do about 40
[00:02:08] speaking engagements a year mostly at
[00:02:11] schools and other um educational or
[00:02:15] mathematical organizations and then
[00:02:17] after the Ted Talk went online in 2008 I
[00:02:21] did like 80 wow uh speaking engagements
[00:02:25] and they included corporate events and
[00:02:27] other you know bigger higher profile um
[00:02:31] events and it you know it's it's sort of
[00:02:34] went down and now it's sort of gradually
[00:02:36] creeped up again I'm yeah doing about 75
[00:02:40] groups a year um uh so and and I'm
[00:02:44] finding more people in my audience who
[00:02:46] have seen me before because of the Ted
[00:02:48] got it yeah uh talk so that that was a
[00:02:51] little bit of a game Cher interesting
[00:02:53] and and did your so you your book which
[00:02:56] is I mean you have a new book out we'll
[00:02:57] talk about that but the the secrets of
[00:02:59] mental math right yes I I thought when I
[00:03:02] got it I guess this was in the mid 2000s
[00:03:04] that was the new book but it seems like
[00:03:06] you had actually released it way earlier
[00:03:08] but re right so I originally wrote a
[00:03:11] book um and that came out around 1995
[00:03:15] and it was called
[00:03:16] mathemagics uh subtitled you know how to
[00:03:19] look like a genius Without Really Trying
[00:03:22] and um uh and and I mean that was the
[00:03:26] book that I'd always wanted to write and
[00:03:29] but it was
[00:03:30] published by a very small publisher and
[00:03:32] ultimately it went out of print I mean
[00:03:34] it did not get much distribution then
[00:03:37] and so when it went out of print I had
[00:03:39] the rights to do with it what I wanted
[00:03:43] and in 2005 at the Ted Talk At the very
[00:03:47] in the audience was a vice president
[00:03:50] from Random House okay and he said I'd
[00:03:53] like to talk to you maybe you've got
[00:03:55] something and I said as a matter of fact
[00:03:58] um here's what I have
[00:04:00] and they said well you know they said
[00:04:02] well we tend to only publish new books I
[00:04:04] said trust me nobody bought the first
[00:04:06] one it will be new to to most of your
[00:04:09] audience and and so I rewrote about 20%
[00:04:12] of the book um and and then it came out
[00:04:16] as secrets of mental math in 2006 got it
[00:04:20] and uh and it has
[00:04:22] done surprisingly well I mean uh I think
[00:04:26] something like
[00:04:27] 250,000 copies have been purchased and
[00:04:30] it's just been a steady I me except for
[00:04:33] the occasional Spike like when I did the
[00:04:34] co bear report um it's it's been a very
[00:04:39] steady um amount so I think there's been
[00:04:42] good word of mouth I don't think there's
[00:04:44] any other good book on the subject that
[00:04:47] really teaches you Comprehensive Mental
[00:04:50] Math um yeah yours yours is very will
[00:04:53] teach you little tricks like yo how to
[00:04:55] square a number that ends in five how to
[00:04:57] multiply a number by 11 little things
[00:05:00] like that and I do that in the very
[00:05:01] first chapter to give you some you know
[00:05:04] empowering this is cool but then we get
[00:05:07] down to business and say but you really
[00:05:09] want to be able to multiply any
[00:05:10] two-digit numbers together how would you
[00:05:12] really add a pair of three-digit or
[00:05:14] four-digit numbers you know things that
[00:05:16] are um more of your bread and butter
[00:05:20] important calculations I mean I'm a
[00:05:21] professor of math so I'm not in for the
[00:05:24] the quick Buck I'm in for really
[00:05:26] teaching people how to do this stuff so
[00:05:29] my reputation's on the line yeah it's
[00:05:32] it's one of my favorite books I actually
[00:05:33] have it on the my bookshelf down there
[00:05:36] see it's that lime green right over
[00:05:38] there yeah yeah but it's you know I'll
[00:05:40] pick it up every once in a while because
[00:05:42] it it's just it's exactly that I mean it
[00:05:44] starts you from the basics and builds
[00:05:46] you up and I feel like every time I go
[00:05:47] through it I just have like this refound
[00:05:50] um ability to like attack these numbers
[00:05:53] uh I'm pretty good at it um but when I
[00:05:56] re read it and I practice a little bit I
[00:05:58] get a little better like any skill of
[00:06:00] course yeah exactly so can we talk a
[00:06:02] little bit about your your upbringing
[00:06:04] I'm I'm curious as to like when you
[00:06:06] started um doing this stuff I feel like
[00:06:10] you've told stories where you kind of
[00:06:12] figured out some cool algebraic stuff
[00:06:14] that you applied and when did it take
[00:06:16] off for you do you think you have
[00:06:17] something different than other people or
[00:06:19] is it well I I so I think I have I mean
[00:06:24] I probably from a very very early age I
[00:06:26] showed an interest in numbers and
[00:06:28] patterns
[00:06:29] for as long as I can remember for as
[00:06:32] long as my mother can remember I had a
[00:06:34] very definite interest in in numbers
[00:06:40] patterns she says that one she said when
[00:06:42] I was um before kindergarten uh I once
[00:06:47] asked the question do two squares make a
[00:06:49] rectangle and she said yes and I said ah
[00:06:54] but two rectangles don't make a square
[00:06:57] you know which I think is pretty high
[00:06:59] level thinking for a kid at that age to
[00:07:01] think about there's a difference between
[00:07:03] a implies B and B implies a you know
[00:07:07] um uh I was um I was diagnosed with some
[00:07:12] neurological disorders as a kid now that
[00:07:15] meant uh I was uh both
[00:07:18] hyperactive and I was put on Valium from
[00:07:21] about age four to about age 13 oh W um
[00:07:26] uh I had two I think they
[00:07:30] abnormal uh what we called eegs
[00:07:34] electroencephalographs where they
[00:07:37] measured brain wave activity and I think
[00:07:39] when I was like three and four they may
[00:07:41] have come out abnormal but everyone
[00:07:44] after that had come out normal and
[00:07:48] um uh I one when I was about two or
[00:07:52] three years old I guess I must have had
[00:07:54] some kind of seizure which really
[00:07:55] freaked out my parents so I took some
[00:07:58] kind of anti-seizure medication on top
[00:08:00] of the Valium and um I don't think that
[00:08:04] that led to the ability to calculate but
[00:08:07] I just put that out there because it's
[00:08:09] intriguing when I read a biography by
[00:08:12] Daniel tamut and again I don't know how
[00:08:14] much of that to take at its word but but
[00:08:16] it made me think oh I had an experience
[00:08:18] a little bit like that in as a kid but I
[00:08:21] think really it was just a case of
[00:08:23] loving to play with numbers I I'm I'm
[00:08:26] willing to bet that there are thousands
[00:08:28] of kids out there right now who if they
[00:08:31] put in the same amount of time and
[00:08:33] enjoyment and practice as I did would be
[00:08:37] outperforming me in fact when my TED
[00:08:40] talk first went out there 2005 I did
[00:08:44] hear from some parents whose kids
[00:08:48] started watching it and they learn read
[00:08:51] my book or later get my DVD course who
[00:08:54] who were like really studying it you
[00:08:57] know I knew this one 10-year-old kid who
[00:08:59] a month later he's out there squaring
[00:09:01] three-digit numbers and doing math magic
[00:09:04] shows for his middle school talents show
[00:09:08] and um and so you really with just a as
[00:09:12] you know with just a little bit of
[00:09:16] practice practicing it the right way you
[00:09:19] can make substantial Improvement in a
[00:09:22] very short amount of time now to be you
[00:09:25] know squaring five-digit numbers and
[00:09:27] doing them super fast well well that
[00:09:30] that requires probably what I had which
[00:09:32] was i' call it the product of a misspent
[00:09:34] youth you know just as a kid I liked
[00:09:38] practicing and playing with numbers it
[00:09:40] was like others would play a video game
[00:09:42] or nowadays I might play online backham
[00:09:45] and you know I might in my head say
[00:09:47] let's see if I can do that you know
[00:09:49] square that four-digit number and you
[00:09:51] know and and I put some memory
[00:09:53] techniques into it I I learned in high I
[00:09:57] getting ahead of my ahead of myself but
[00:09:58] in High School I read a book on the
[00:10:01] memory book by Harry Lorraine and Jerry
[00:10:03] Lucas and um which my my mother showed
[00:10:07] me she was getting her Masters in
[00:10:09] special education because of her
[00:10:11] hyperactive son me yeah and um and I was
[00:10:15] always interested in how the brain
[00:10:17] worked and um and I applied some of that
[00:10:22] when I started forgetting things you
[00:10:24] know in a big calculation I don't need
[00:10:26] them for squaring twood digit or
[00:10:29] three-digit numbers but when I'm doing a
[00:10:31] larger problem like a four-digit or
[00:10:33] five-digit then it's convenient to turn
[00:10:35] numbers into words you know all that
[00:10:37] very well and um and it's you know it's
[00:10:41] easier to remember um you know yeah if
[00:10:45] you want to hold on to 342 it's easier
[00:10:47] to remember [ __ ] or mour than it is to
[00:10:51] remember 342 especially all you have
[00:10:53] other numbers uh flying around um the a
[00:10:58] a turning point for for me that I've
[00:11:00] mentioned in other interviews is uh it
[00:11:02] was around the eth grade that I had
[00:11:04] figured out an algorithm for for
[00:11:06] squaring numbers that's just on my own I
[00:11:08] said oh this is I noticed a pattern I
[00:11:11] said wow you could use this pattern to
[00:11:13] help you square numbers quickly and as
[00:11:15] luck would have it a few weeks later in
[00:11:17] our math in our algebra class the
[00:11:19] teacher left an answer on the board as
[00:11:21] 1008 squared and being the kid that I
[00:11:26] was I blurt it out well that's 11,6 4
[00:11:30] and she said wow that's right how did
[00:11:32] you do that and I showed her I said well
[00:11:34] I went down 8 to 100 up 8 to 116
[00:11:37] multipli them together to get 11,600
[00:11:39] added the square of eight which is 64 to
[00:11:42] get
[00:11:42] 11,664 that's amazing yeah and she said
[00:11:46] and and she was very smart algebra
[00:11:48] teacher and she recognized the algebra
[00:11:50] that was underneath what was going on
[00:11:52] though I had not done it with algebra um
[00:11:55] I don't know if that's to my credit or
[00:11:56] to my detriment I just did it by look at
[00:11:59] lots and lots of examples and seeing
[00:12:00] that it always worked um and and also
[00:12:03] being interested in the numbers I mean
[00:12:05] you were probably playing around with
[00:12:07] stuff on your own and just seeing
[00:12:10] patterns and and things like that right
[00:12:12] I think most people were exposed to the
[00:12:14] beautiful patterns of mathematics they'd
[00:12:16] be just as intrigued you know uh that
[00:12:18] there's really great beautiful stuff out
[00:12:21] there um and uh but it was it was a
[00:12:24] turning point in the sense that it was
[00:12:27] nobody from my middle school had seen it
[00:12:29] apparently no one from my high school
[00:12:30] had seen this before so it gave me a
[00:12:33] sense of wow I just figured out
[00:12:35] something new and wouldn't it be
[00:12:39] um uh great I mean like I mean it gave
[00:12:43] me the the satisfaction of having
[00:12:46] figured out something on my own and um
[00:12:49] the think thinking well if I could do
[00:12:52] these problems what if I practiced it
[00:12:54] further and did bigger ones and faster
[00:12:56] ones that was also tied in with
[00:12:59] um I had a little bit of an incentive
[00:13:01] because uh I was also a magician I mean
[00:13:05] I I I grew up in a very theatrical
[00:13:07] family and um a lot of nerdy kids get
[00:13:11] into magic it's it gives them a little
[00:13:13] bit of a social acceptability unless
[00:13:16] they go overboard like I kind of did and
[00:13:19] um uh but I would do magic shows for
[00:13:22] kids parties throughout the east side of
[00:13:24] Cleveland Ohio um and uh as I started
[00:13:29] doing shows for older audiences my my
[00:13:32] father suggested I put some of the my
[00:13:34] number stuff into the act because he
[00:13:36] thought it was more impressive than the
[00:13:38] the fake mind reading stuff that I was
[00:13:39] learning about and he said and and to my
[00:13:43] surprise it got the biggest reaction of
[00:13:44] the show yeah so that was a a moment
[00:13:48] this was around the end of high school I
[00:13:50] said wow if people like that imagine if
[00:13:52] I practice it more and got you know did
[00:13:54] bigger problems and such and uh so in
[00:13:57] college I started Ed to put together a
[00:13:59] little bit of a nightclub act um I went
[00:14:02] to Carnegie melon University in
[00:14:04] Pittsburgh and um and it got a lot of
[00:14:07] attention and sort of took off from
[00:14:09] there very cool and and so how long so
[00:14:12] I've looked I've watched as I said a lot
[00:14:14] of your talks and you have a a formula
[00:14:16] right like it's it's it seems like
[00:14:18] you've done it like you said I mean 70
[00:14:20] times a year but when when did you like
[00:14:22] develop that actual
[00:14:25] show uh like to to finish with the five
[00:14:29] digit Square to do the you know I I
[00:14:32] think now
[00:14:36] when I I the so it it began with doing
[00:14:41] doing some calculations in the middle of
[00:14:44] a what you might have called a mentalism
[00:14:47] show a me you know mental magic kind of
[00:14:49] show which included things like memory
[00:14:52] and and you know sort of your pseudo
[00:14:56] psychic kinds of tricks and and
[00:14:59] um uh but early on I met with some
[00:15:05] people from the
[00:15:08] um uh the critical thinking Community
[00:15:11] particularly uh James Randy the magician
[00:15:14] um who sort of labeled psychic Enemy
[00:15:18] Number One I mean basically felt that
[00:15:20] there were people there spreading lots
[00:15:22] of false information and the public too
[00:15:25] much belief in pseudo science and
[00:15:27] basically saying you know art you don't
[00:15:30] need this other stuff you should just do
[00:15:32] the stuff that's legitimate the stuff
[00:15:34] that you could
[00:15:35] explain um and so it would I would say
[00:15:40] it was around the my first year of
[00:15:42] college that I started put together a
[00:15:45] this mathemagics show there was a
[00:15:47] nightclub in Pittsburgh called the Dove
[00:15:50] and rabbit that had magicians as
[00:15:53] entertainment uh and uh I performed
[00:15:58] there once every month or two um and the
[00:16:02] ACT started to develop a little bit of
[00:16:04] Polish I would do talks in some of the
[00:16:07] psychology classrooms at Carnegie melon
[00:16:10] they had a strong program in cognitive
[00:16:13] psychology and I would explain things
[00:16:16] just you know it was just really an ex a
[00:16:19] a show and tell
[00:16:22] um
[00:16:24] uh
[00:16:26] and and I prefer per formed at some
[00:16:29] magicians conventions um there was the
[00:16:32] International Brotherhood of magicians
[00:16:34] annual convention there was a uh a
[00:16:38] competition for magicians under 21 that
[00:16:40] was held in at Abbott's magic get
[00:16:43] together in Colon Michigan I finished
[00:16:45] third place that year before two other
[00:16:48] really good magicians so I was very
[00:16:50] happy with that um and so it was very
[00:16:53] gradually developed when I finally moved
[00:16:55] out to California in
[00:16:57] 1989 uh to be a professor of mathematics
[00:17:00] at Harvey mud College um there was the
[00:17:04] Magic Castle less than 50 miles away and
[00:17:08] to any any teenage magician that was the
[00:17:12] mecca that was the that was the symbol
[00:17:15] of you know great magic I mean the best
[00:17:18] magicians in the world perform there it
[00:17:20] was exciting just to be able to go there
[00:17:22] but to be able to perform would say that
[00:17:24] you've made it so I auditioned there my
[00:17:28] first year of teaching I was 28 years
[00:17:31] old or so and um uh and it went really
[00:17:37] well I mean got a standing ovation even
[00:17:40] I was you know really thrilled and uh so
[00:17:43] they said yes we'd love to have you
[00:17:44] perform so from that year on about one
[00:17:47] or two weeks out of the year I'd perform
[00:17:49] at the at this magic castle and the
[00:17:51] advantage of performing there is you're
[00:17:53] doing three shows a night for seven
[00:17:55] straight nights so you're act really
[00:17:58] really has a chance to coales and
[00:18:01] converge to the good material so your
[00:18:04] patter becomes very natural your if you
[00:18:07] say something funny in one show you can
[00:18:09] try it out in the next show and the next
[00:18:11] one and then it sticks in there whereas
[00:18:13] if you're just doing a show every two
[00:18:15] weeks you might have said something
[00:18:17] funny but forget to say it the next time
[00:18:19] or maybe it really wasn't that funny and
[00:18:21] you you have time to you can mold it
[00:18:23] very
[00:18:25] nicely so the Magic Castle uh was in in
[00:18:29] particular there was this room called
[00:18:30] The Parlor of preed digitation and my
[00:18:33] act really had a chance to grow up there
[00:18:36] um and and again for about 10 years I
[00:18:39] was mainly doing shows for schools but
[00:18:43] then after the Ted Talk 2008 or so uh it
[00:18:48] changed a bit sure yeah interesting can
[00:18:51] we talk a little bit about uh some of
[00:18:53] your squaring Powers um so cuz I I love
[00:18:57] watching and and I'm such a nerd that I
[00:19:00] actually um when you do the five-digit
[00:19:02] stuff I've watched so many of them I
[00:19:03] actually take notes of how you say it
[00:19:05] because I'm I'm just always curious what
[00:19:06] you're saying out loud you know um and
[00:19:09] you are really hearing 90% of what's in
[00:19:12] my head I'm not holding some people ask
[00:19:14] me now you're not really doing it that
[00:19:16] way are you I said oh my gosh it would
[00:19:18] be much harder to be doing it one way
[00:19:20] while pretending to do it another way
[00:19:22] that I I can't multitask like that yeah
[00:19:27] so the the two digit squares let's start
[00:19:29] there are those are those at this point
[00:19:33] not not memorized but are you just so
[00:19:35] familiar with them that they're they are
[00:19:37] unintentionally memorized I you know
[00:19:41] been squaring two-digit numbers since I
[00:19:43] was I don't know 13 so for well over
[00:19:46] half my life I'm um I've been squaring
[00:19:50] two-digit numbers so I just know them in
[00:19:52] the same way that you might know that 13
[00:19:55] squar is 169 even though you weren't
[00:19:58] forced to learn that in school you've
[00:20:00] just heard it enough times you know
[00:20:02] you're a computer scientist so you
[00:20:04] probably know 16 squared or 32 squared
[00:20:07] or 64 squared just because it shows up a
[00:20:10] lot in your work um so uh in in that
[00:20:15] same way and when you square a
[00:20:17] three-digit number you do the two-digit
[00:20:19] squares as a sub problem so those have
[00:20:21] been they're there you know really
[00:20:23] reinforced so um yes I I I'll I freely
[00:20:28] admit that the two-digit squares are now
[00:20:31] practically memorized I think every now
[00:20:33] and then maybe if I'm tired I still find
[00:20:36] myself you know doing the calculation
[00:20:39] and um to check it but they're they're
[00:20:42] for all intents and purposes memorized
[00:20:45] three-digit squares on the other hand
[00:20:47] though I'm sure I've squared every one
[00:20:49] of them a few times in my life
[00:20:52] um except for a dozen of them I don't
[00:20:55] have them memorized but
[00:20:58] they're
[00:21:00] probably familiar enough that if I give
[00:21:03] the wrong answer I might detect that
[00:21:07] something seems wrong right not that I
[00:21:09] you know I mean let me give you an
[00:21:11] example if I see a two-digit square if
[00:21:15] if um if if I see an address and it's
[00:21:21] 4624 Main Street I'll see that 4624 and
[00:21:25] go oh that's 68 squared okay okay yeah
[00:21:28] but I wouldn't have that recognition
[00:21:31] with any of the three digigit squares I
[00:21:33] wouldn't you know I wouldn't see oh look
[00:21:36] 12,996 isn't that 114 squared no I
[00:21:39] wouldn't I wouldn't I don't have that
[00:21:42] kind of familiarity whereas all of the
[00:21:44] two-digit squares I know in the same way
[00:21:48] that you might know all 50 capitals you
[00:21:51] know oh Montgomery isn't that the
[00:21:52] capital of Alabama you know it's that
[00:21:55] sort of thing so um so no I really am
[00:21:58] calculating the three-digit squares and
[00:22:02] I mean I'll walk through it with you if
[00:22:03] you want
[00:22:05] um one thing that's helpful is that I do
[00:22:08] all of my calculations from left to
[00:22:11] right to right and that's the opposite
[00:22:13] of how we do it on paper right and by
[00:22:15] doing it left to right I can say the
[00:22:18] answer while I'm still calculating the
[00:22:21] rest of the answer which was a was my
[00:22:25] initial incentive as a showoff kid do it
[00:22:28] left to right I can say my answer you
[00:22:30] know start to say it they think you got
[00:22:32] the whole answer whereas you just got
[00:22:33] the beginning of it but in fact
[00:22:35] cognitively it makes sense it's how you
[00:22:37] you read numbers left to right you
[00:22:38] pronounce them left to right with uh
[00:22:41] practice you can calculate left to right
[00:22:43] um and it's the more important numbers
[00:22:46] are on the left anyway more important to
[00:22:48] know that your number is a little over
[00:22:50] 120,000 than to know that it ends in six
[00:22:53] yeah so yeah uh yeah so that's uh that's
[00:22:57] another good reason to work uh left to
[00:23:00] right but sure let's I mean one we'll
[00:23:02] we'll I'll I'll talk through two digigit
[00:23:04] three digigit four digigit squares with
[00:23:06] you whatever you'd like yeah cuz I'm
[00:23:07] sure some of the listeners would love to
[00:23:09] see your speed and then kind of
[00:23:11] understand what's going on in your head
[00:23:12] can I ask you a few two dig two digit
[00:23:14] squares yeah well just do one because I
[00:23:16] as I said I know those automatically but
[00:23:18] then then we'll do some three digits and
[00:23:20] so on guys two digit Square all right so
[00:23:21] Random let's say 77
[00:23:25] 5929 okay and did that one just come to
[00:23:28] you you know I think it kind of I think
[00:23:31] I start the calculation and then I kind
[00:23:33] of slide into the answer if you know
[00:23:35] what I mean it's like that those those
[00:23:38] neural pathways are so well worn that I
[00:23:41] think you know there's very little
[00:23:43] friction you know what I'm saying um so
[00:23:48] uh and and and like I said if I saw
[00:23:51] 5929 um as an address or as part of a
[00:23:55] confirmation number or something yeah uh
[00:23:57] or phone number I would recognize that
[00:23:59] as 77 squared so got it um let's do some
[00:24:04] three-digit numbers cuz those I'm really
[00:24:05] calculating okay so let's try uh
[00:24:10] 356 okay that would be
[00:24:14] 12673 wow that's crazy and I and I don't
[00:24:17] have that one memorized I really was
[00:24:19] calculating it um and I and and because
[00:24:24] the first part of my calculation
[00:24:26] involves 400 *
[00:24:28] 312 where I'll tell you why later but
[00:24:31] you know I can start to say the
[00:24:33] 120 I mean I know what when I do four
[00:24:37] time 312 and you could do you can do
[00:24:40] four time 312 right left to right it's
[00:24:43] 1,48 yeah so I start with
[00:24:47] 24,800 I know at that point that the
[00:24:50] answer is either going to be 125,000 or
[00:24:53] 126,000 and something yeah right so I
[00:24:56] have enough time as I start this say
[00:24:59] 120 I I see it's going to be 6,000 and
[00:25:02] then 736 I mean I'm yeah you know I am
[00:25:07] taking a second or two but it because I
[00:25:10] start to say the answer right away
[00:25:12] people go it sounds instant like in it
[00:25:14] sounds instantaneous um so what am I
[00:25:17] doing yeah let's let's break it down
[00:25:19] let's let's walk through this so 356 all
[00:25:22] right but I'm I I'll back up by first
[00:25:24] doing 44 squared which is actually part
[00:25:27] of this calculation so let me start by
[00:25:29] explaining a two-digit square and then
[00:25:31] I'll do theit so let's say I want to
[00:25:33] square the number 44 okay um just 19 is
[00:25:37] it 1936 it is 1936 that's the one I just
[00:25:40] know instantly because it's almost like
[00:25:42] a year you know it's very funny it is
[00:25:44] the year my mother was born and all her
[00:25:47] life her favorite number was four her
[00:25:50] email address even has a 44 in it oh wow
[00:25:53] and and and only recently did I make the
[00:25:56] connection of the 44 in the 1936 I mean
[00:26:00] completely random for her too but uh
[00:26:04] that's pretty funny so 44 so what do I
[00:26:06] do I go down four to 40 yep I balance it
[00:26:11] by going up four to 48 so you find the
[00:26:14] nearest 10 basically nearest multiple of
[00:26:16] 10 I always do that for my two-digit
[00:26:19] squares so 44 the nearest easy number is
[00:26:21] 40 I go down 4 to 40 I go up 4 to 48 now
[00:26:26] I do 40 * 48 and that's 4 * 48 with a
[00:26:30] friendly zero attached now to do 4 * 48
[00:26:34] we do it left to right 4 * 40
[00:26:38] [Music]
[00:26:40] is60 4 * 8 is
[00:26:43] 32 add those from left to right now
[00:26:46] think about it 160 + 32
[00:26:51] is92 92 attach the zero because we
[00:26:54] really multiplying by 40 to get 1920 now
[00:26:58] you could stop there and you'd have a
[00:26:59] great estimate to get it exactly though
[00:27:02] all you have to add is the square of the
[00:27:04] number you went up and down and you went
[00:27:06] up and down four four squared is 16 so
[00:27:10] 1920 + 16 is,
[00:27:14] 1936 got it yeah I'll do one more
[00:27:16] example for your audience it'll be
[00:27:18] easier for them to follow let's say
[00:27:20] let's take a big number like 97 yeah
[00:27:23] this time the nearest easy number would
[00:27:25] be 100 so we'll go up three to 100 we go
[00:27:30] down three to what to 94 94 right
[00:27:34] because I want 9 I went up three I have
[00:27:36] to go down three so 100 time 94 is
[00:27:39] simply 9400 you could start to say that
[00:27:42] answer right now
[00:27:44] 9,400 and what do you add to that the
[00:27:47] square of three because you went up and
[00:27:49] down three square of three is nine and
[00:27:51] there's your answer
[00:27:55] 9,49 nice okay now let's bring this up
[00:27:59] to three-digit squares so for two
[00:28:02] digigit squares I round to the nearest
[00:28:04] 10 for three digigit squares I round to
[00:28:08] the nearest 100 yeah so when you give me
[00:28:12] 356 I round that up to 400 I go up 44 to
[00:28:19] 400 I go down
[00:28:22] 44 to
[00:28:24] 312 now I'll give you a little Pro Pro
[00:28:27] tip here I don't actually do the
[00:28:30] subtraction I don't actually do 356
[00:28:33] minus 44 to get 32 what I actually do is
[00:28:37] I double the number you gave me 356 yeah
[00:28:41] double it at
[00:28:42] 712 and the numbers I'm going to
[00:28:44] multiply are going to have the same
[00:28:47] total as the or as the as double the
[00:28:50] original number that kind of makes sense
[00:28:52] right because if we went up 44 and down
[00:28:55] 44 they're going to have the same total
[00:28:57] as twice 356 that's true yeah
[00:29:00] interesting and and it's easier for me
[00:29:03] to just double the 356 to get 712 in
[00:29:07] fact I only really have to double the 56
[00:29:09] to get 112 and to know that if one of my
[00:29:13] numbers is 400 the other has to be
[00:29:17] 312 in order for that total to be
[00:29:21] 712 got it so I actually don't do
[00:29:24] subtraction which is neat right so I
[00:29:26] mean to do that that I was going to ask
[00:29:28] is like that's hard for some people to
[00:29:30] do very fast the subtraction part you
[00:29:32] know but if I said double 56 and it's
[00:29:35] 112 now you know the number is
[00:29:39] 312 that's cool that's a nice yeah it's
[00:29:42] gonna it's always going to start with
[00:29:45] the same first digit as you you know
[00:29:48] like if you say 300 and something then
[00:29:50] I'm either going to go down 300 to
[00:29:52] Something in the high 300s or I'm going
[00:29:54] to go up to 400 times something in the
[00:29:56] low 300s so you know you know when you
[00:29:59] say 800 and blah blah blah I'm going to
[00:30:01] multiply something by something that's
[00:30:03] in the 800s and I can figure out the the
[00:30:07] the last two digits just by doubling
[00:30:09] your number so if your number ended in
[00:30:11] 42 then I double that to get 84 if your
[00:30:15] number was 84 ended an 84 I double that
[00:30:18] to get 168 I'm going to multiply it by
[00:30:21] something ending in 68 interesting
[00:30:24] that's clever that's really good yeah so
[00:30:26] that's a that it saves second or so in
[00:30:28] the calculation and and makes and I
[00:30:31] don't have to I don't need the 44 if you
[00:30:33] were squaring 356 I don't need that 44
[00:30:36] until much later so you know why why get
[00:30:39] get it involved just now so you say 356
[00:30:42] so I go I I double it to get 712 I do
[00:30:46] 400 time 312 now 4 * 312 is 1248 so
[00:30:51] that's
[00:30:53] 124,00 quickly I do the square of 44 cuz
[00:30:57] that's that's one that and and there too
[00:30:59] when you say 356 I know the complement
[00:31:02] of 56 is 44 in other words if I gave if
[00:31:05] if I if I owed you 56 cents and I gave
[00:31:08] you a dollar you'd give me 44 cents
[00:31:10] change back right that's the complement
[00:31:12] of 56 so um so I have 1248 plus the
[00:31:17] square of 44 which I know is
[00:31:20] 1,936 so now I can start to say
[00:31:25] 126,000 while I add the 800 and the 936
[00:31:29] to get the 736 for the rest of the
[00:31:32] answer that's awesome that's give me
[00:31:34] another number I'll do it um do you want
[00:31:36] me to you want me to think out loud
[00:31:38] while I do it or you want me to just say
[00:31:39] the answer no let's let's let's say it
[00:31:40] out loud uh is that cool yeah all right
[00:31:43] let's say uh
[00:31:46] 578 okay 600 * 556 is 333,000 plus 484
[00:31:50] is
[00:31:53] 33484 that's awes I feel like it would
[00:31:55] have been faster you hadn't said any of
[00:31:56] that abs abely yeah that's why I asked
[00:31:58] if you wanted the um because I can only
[00:32:00] speak so fast without sputtering so um
[00:32:04] that but but I slowed down but I gave
[00:32:06] you the steps that I really was doing
[00:32:08] here give me an another I just this is
[00:32:09] fun yeah yeah uh 213 200 226 45200 + 169
[00:32:15] is
[00:32:16] 45369 yeah I'm going to give you an easy
[00:32:19] one uh 9.95 990,000 and 25 yeah right I
[00:32:24] went up five you could do that I got up
[00:32:25] five to a th000 down five to 990 990
[00:32:28] time 1,000 is 990,000 5 squ yeah that's
[00:32:31] 5 yeah that's awesome and now so I've
[00:32:35] seen you do the four I've seen you do
[00:32:36] the five have you ever tried like more
[00:32:39] well when I was so when I was in college
[00:32:43] um I I I remember still I was in a um my
[00:32:48] uh spring semester of my first year I
[00:32:51] was taking a class in cognitive
[00:32:53] psychology because naturally I was very
[00:32:54] interested in that and um
[00:32:58] uh we had a teacher uh Professor Marcel
[00:33:01] just who
[00:33:03] was he one day in his topic was he was
[00:33:07] talking about he says to understand the
[00:33:09] brain it's it's good to understand
[00:33:10] people sort of at the extremes and he
[00:33:13] talked about people who did Lightning
[00:33:15] Fast calculations and and then he said
[00:33:18] now there are some tricks for doing
[00:33:20] certain easy kinds of problems and he
[00:33:22] demonstrated a couple of these tricks
[00:33:24] like taking the fifth root of a
[00:33:27] okay perfect fifth power you know and um
[00:33:31] and he said now I know I've got a lot of
[00:33:33] math and Engineering types in this
[00:33:36] audience does anyone else here know any
[00:33:38] tricks and I suspected he knew about me
[00:33:41] but I I said um I decided oh what the
[00:33:44] hell so I raised my hand and I I I then
[00:33:47] took over the classroom for 10 minutes
[00:33:49] doing my nightclub act that I was just
[00:33:52] developing and um and you know he was
[00:33:56] impressed of course and now when you
[00:33:58] take when you do a psychology class at
[00:34:00] almost any college uh campus you are you
[00:34:04] become as part of your class requirement
[00:34:07] you have to participate in some
[00:34:08] psychology experiments that's where the
[00:34:11] professors and grad students get their
[00:34:14] volunteers and I talked to him
[00:34:16] afterwards I said you know I'm willing
[00:34:18] to do these experiments but if there's a
[00:34:20] professor here who'd like to you know
[00:34:22] learn about my cognitive processes I'd
[00:34:25] be happy to and he says you know I think
[00:34:26] we've got just the person and he
[00:34:28] introduced me to a fellow named William
[00:34:30] Chase okay and Bill Chase um was famous
[00:34:35] in the psychology Community um for doing
[00:34:39] an experiment with another psychologist
[00:34:41] named herb Simon and it was about the
[00:34:44] memory of Chess positions okay yeah and
[00:34:48] right so you you know this that is when
[00:34:51] when when when showing random chess
[00:34:54] positions to Masters versus novices the
[00:34:58] Masters could memorize it in a few
[00:35:00] seconds you know novices would not be
[00:35:03] able to a hard time to do it but when
[00:35:06] they but when the chess player the
[00:35:08] Masters were shown not random chess
[00:35:11] positions but the board filled with
[00:35:14] pieces put at random nonsensical would
[00:35:17] never arise in any game they were just
[00:35:20] as bad as the novices yeah which showed
[00:35:22] that the Chess Masters had some
[00:35:24] structure to their you know that that
[00:35:27] they were able to chunk things and say
[00:35:29] ah I see a fianchettoed bishop over here
[00:35:33] castled on the queen side and uh doubled
[00:35:36] pawns over there etc etc I used to play
[00:35:39] so um they um you know so it would be
[00:35:42] easier for them to to make sense of the
[00:35:44] whole they would see the story there
[00:35:46] anyway so he was interested in skilled
[00:35:49] memory he he also had done an experiment
[00:35:53] and you you should look up this paper
[00:35:55] given your interested memory
[00:35:57] um on the uh that that showed two had
[00:36:01] two students who were able to expand
[00:36:05] their digit recall from seven digits to
[00:36:09] ultimately about a 100 digits I think I
[00:36:11] know I think it's I think it's talked
[00:36:13] about in Josh for's book actually it
[00:36:15] might be by Chase and Erikson and
[00:36:16] Erikson is the same guy who honors
[00:36:19] Ericson who who's the expert on
[00:36:21] expertise okay right the 10,000 hours
[00:36:24] guy he was a postto at Carnegie melon
[00:36:28] with working with Bill Chase when I was
[00:36:31] a When I Was An undergraduate there so I
[00:36:34] actually did a little bit of work with
[00:36:36] them so there there's his paper by Chase
[00:36:38] and Ericson uh talks about digit span
[00:36:42] and he and and it it concerns two
[00:36:45] Runners that's right yeah long distance
[00:36:47] Runners who um first was with one
[00:36:51] student then a couple years later this
[00:36:52] other student but what what the what
[00:36:54] they' come up with was thinking of the
[00:36:56] numbers as they were called out as
[00:37:00] um uh running times like if the first
[00:37:04] four digits was
[00:37:06] 3562 they'd say oh
[00:37:09] 356.00 would be an excellent mile time
[00:37:12] right you know 3 minutes 56.2 seconds
[00:37:15] and and then for a while they plateaued
[00:37:18] at about 28 digits because they would be
[00:37:20] memorizing like seven running times yeah
[00:37:23] and then at some point they turned a
[00:37:25] corner and had a whole track meet you
[00:37:28] know with many you know a super
[00:37:31] structure of that allowed them to
[00:37:34] memorize things and it it sort of um
[00:37:37] contradicted the classic result by
[00:37:39] Miller that there were seven plus or
[00:37:41] minus two digits that we could
[00:37:44] memorize um so they were interested in
[00:37:47] my memory because they said look anyone
[00:37:49] can multiply four digigit numbers on
[00:37:51] paper right why aren't but why can't we
[00:37:54] do it in the head we run out of memory
[00:37:56] so what what's he doing and they tested
[00:37:58] my memory like if they gave
[00:38:00] me um you know they called out 10
[00:38:03] vegetable fruit names I was at no better
[00:38:06] at reciting those 10 names back than
[00:38:10] anybody else yeah but if um with numbers
[00:38:14] and I could get phonetics involved well
[00:38:17] then becomes much easier um so but my my
[00:38:21] my my working memory was no was nothing
[00:38:24] special and even now I would say you
[00:38:26] know maybe I can hold 8 to 10 digits at
[00:38:29] a time in the calculation but I'm using
[00:38:34] I'm saying my answer partly to get it
[00:38:36] out of my memory and into yours right
[00:38:39] right um and when I do a sub calculation
[00:38:43] that number is usually immediately put
[00:38:45] into the next calculation as I try not
[00:38:49] to store numbers put them aside and do a
[00:38:51] separate calculation and if that
[00:38:53] separate calculation is going to take
[00:38:55] literally more than a few seconds
[00:38:57] then I have to code that stored result
[00:39:00] into a word so I don't forget it but
[00:39:03] ideally I start saying my answer so I
[00:39:06] can forget things right so um anyway so
[00:39:09] I I forgive me for going off on all
[00:39:11] these T fascinating PhD here at work but
[00:39:14] um uh so I got to meet and work with
[00:39:18] Professor uh Chase oh by the way if you
[00:39:20] ever look up that paper by Jas and
[00:39:23] Erikson they compare these two run ERS
[00:39:27] who were initialed SF and DD their names
[00:39:30] were Steve falloon and Dario donatelli
[00:39:33] and then they they actually have a
[00:39:35] comparison with a college student memory
[00:39:40] expert named ab and that was me that was
[00:39:42] you okay I am AB
[00:39:45] in um I'm in the acknowledgements thanks
[00:39:48] for you know to so you might people
[00:39:50] might have inferred that but I'm I'm
[00:39:52] coming out to say I am AB you are AB
[00:39:55] make it known and and and I would use
[00:39:57] phonetics to memorize digit spans and I
[00:40:01] didn't wasn't as quick or as fast as
[00:40:04] they were but I was pretty pretty
[00:40:07] competitive so um uh so there it is uh
[00:40:11] anyway so I worked with Bill Chase for
[00:40:15] uh my three or four years at Carnegie
[00:40:18] melon and um in the Pro then this goes
[00:40:21] back to your original question of have I
[00:40:23] gone beyond the five digits squares so
[00:40:26] when I started I was squaring
[00:40:28] three-digit numbers fast I was just
[00:40:31] starting to square four-digit numbers I
[00:40:33] was just putting that into my
[00:40:36] act and I really thought that
[00:40:38] multiplying two different three-digit
[00:40:41] numbers was out of my range
[00:40:44] okay
[00:40:46] um
[00:40:47] and but while I was working with him and
[00:40:50] I understood my processes better and I
[00:40:53] use those pneumonics more frequently the
[00:40:55] phonetic code by the time I finished
[00:40:58] College I was able to multiply two
[00:41:02] different six digigit numbers together
[00:41:06] wow now sometimes it would be shown to
[00:41:08] me on paper so I wouldn't have to
[00:41:10] remember the problem sometimes they'd
[00:41:12] say okay here's the six-digit problem
[00:41:15] and I the first thing I'd have to do
[00:41:17] would be to
[00:41:18] encode the the 12 digits I'd have to get
[00:41:21] four three-digit
[00:41:23] words you know so the first six-digit
[00:41:26] number okay
[00:41:27] 824 okay that's finer okay and then you
[00:41:31] know 329 that's ManUp okay finer man up
[00:41:35] times you know so it would take me 30
[00:41:37] seconds maybe even just to encode the
[00:41:40] problem yeah and and um and and those
[00:41:45] would take me five to 10 minutes I mean
[00:41:48] squaring would be much much easier
[00:41:50] because what do you do you would do the
[00:41:52] three you take the three chunks and do
[00:41:55] those two those two and then the cross
[00:41:57] exactly that's exactly what I'm doing
[00:41:59] and and when I'm doing if I do a pair of
[00:42:02] five-digit numbers and sometimes you may
[00:42:05] have caught some video footage I've
[00:42:06] occasionally multiplied two different
[00:42:09] five-digit numbers I haven't seen I'll
[00:42:12] only do that if the first five-digit
[00:42:14] number is really friendly you know like
[00:42:17] if the first two digits were you know 24
[00:42:21] or 12 or something and the three-digit
[00:42:23] number if it was 996 I say okay that's
[00:42:26] 1,000 minus 4 that'll be an easy thing
[00:42:28] to multiply or it's it's 324 which I can
[00:42:32] Factor as 9 * 6times six you know I mean
[00:42:36] if if the number's friendly enough and
[00:42:38] I'm feeling confident enough I'll
[00:42:41] actually multiply different five-digit
[00:42:43] numbers but I still like to have the
[00:42:45] number in front of me so a lot less to
[00:42:49] remember yeah
[00:42:51] um uh so anyway the point is I and I
[00:42:53] would get the answer right about 50 % of
[00:42:56] the time so on the first time so if I
[00:42:58] was doing a two different six-digit
[00:43:00] numbers it took me 5 to 10 minutes and I
[00:43:03] got it right about half the time um if
[00:43:06] it was if I could see the problem it
[00:43:09] would take me less time my accuracy
[00:43:11] would go up you know um but yeah so
[00:43:15] there's somewhere out there tons of data
[00:43:17] Professor Chase passed away about a year
[00:43:20] or two after I had finished gra uh my
[00:43:24] bachelor's degree tragically so did the
[00:43:27] SF Steve falloon he um he had picked up
[00:43:32] some kind of blood disease and it might
[00:43:34] have been AIDS it was the early 80s that
[00:43:37] came through like his running shoot is
[00:43:40] he he I think he had M must have had
[00:43:43] some blood transfusion and I'll bet some
[00:43:45] and it was tainted with something this
[00:43:47] was and and he he had to have
[00:43:49] transfusions for a couple years and then
[00:43:51] he passed away uh Dario donatelli still
[00:43:54] he may be the track coach Carnegie melon
[00:43:57] still I think he's stayed there um uh
[00:44:00] but Professor Chase he passed away uh
[00:44:03] running on the track um you know he must
[00:44:07] have been late 40s early 50s and um uh
[00:44:12] had a heart attack he had no prior heart
[00:44:14] condition but he he had a heart attack
[00:44:17] and they found him the next day so um uh
[00:44:21] and that that ended that research I
[00:44:23] think but interesting yeah but that's
[00:44:26] that's fascinating the six digits Wow
[00:44:28] have you ever thought about competing in
[00:44:31] the mental calculation World
[00:44:33] Cups well I haven't thought I mean it's
[00:44:36] always been Europe have you looked about
[00:44:39] the into them a little bit only in that
[00:44:41] I I I've I've noticed it and I've gotten
[00:44:43] invitations each year to come
[00:44:46] out it it's it's always been over the
[00:44:50] summer in Europe sometimes it would I it
[00:44:53] wouldn't um it would cost me to come out
[00:44:57] there it's not like they'd be paying my
[00:44:58] my travel and compensating me in any way
[00:45:02] and I you know for for me the mental
[00:45:04] calculation believe it or not has always
[00:45:06] really been a hobby okay and I'm sure
[00:45:09] you know if I wanted to be at Peak
[00:45:11] Performance like to be Peak Performance
[00:45:13] of anything literally anything because
[00:45:17] you know if you're not put giving it
[00:45:19] 150% someone else is if you really want
[00:45:21] to be top of the top you have to do that
[00:45:25] and
[00:45:26] um I'm I'm interested in so many other
[00:45:29] things and let me get that off on the
[00:45:31] record I you know I love mental
[00:45:33] calculation but I like you know pure
[00:45:36] mathematics combinatorics playing back
[00:45:39] Amon going to the theater writing song
[00:45:41] lyrics spending time with my wife and
[00:45:43] two daughters I mean I've got a very you
[00:45:47] know it's I'm I'm I'm I'm sure there are
[00:45:50] thousands of people out there who can
[00:45:52] calculate raw calculation faster than
[00:45:55] than me um but at least I there aren't
[00:45:59] too many that have created an
[00:46:01] entertaining um show about it and I
[00:46:04] think many of them are introverted and
[00:46:06] not the kind that like to go up on stage
[00:46:09] there is the I know that the calculation
[00:46:11] cup is in Las Vegas this year yeah
[00:46:14] contacted by one of the organizers Scott
[00:46:17] flans Scott yeah and he asked if I'd be
[00:46:20] willing to come out for that and barring
[00:46:24] some kind of conflict and depending on
[00:46:26] my teaching schedule uh I will try to
[00:46:29] make it even if only to do a um a uh a
[00:46:34] session a Q&A like what we're doing here
[00:46:36] I'd love to get you know if you're there
[00:46:38] and I'm there and you want to interview
[00:46:40] me in front of a panel or in front of an
[00:46:43] audience like we're doing now that would
[00:46:44] be wonderful you know yeah yeah oh that
[00:46:46] would be great I'll be there I'm going
[00:46:48] to do the memory side of things but I
[00:46:50] was gonna maybe try and do the math
[00:46:52] stuff just for fun why not yeah uh
[00:46:55] that's and and and if if I had gone you
[00:46:58] know if if I had read Joshua foer's book
[00:47:01] when I was in high school there's no
[00:47:03] doubt in my mind I would be trying to
[00:47:06] learn the dec of card memorization the
[00:47:09] whole you know subject action object I
[00:47:13] think it's a brilliant idea yeah that I
[00:47:16] think with you know with just a little
[00:47:19] bit of in investment of effort you know
[00:47:22] getting your images and actions for all
[00:47:25] 52 cards times three you know would be
[00:47:29] fun and you know combine that with a
[00:47:30] Memory Palace I think that would be a
[00:47:33] fun thing to do um but I I think that
[00:47:38] ship has sailed for me I mean if I
[00:47:40] really wanted to I would but I too many
[00:47:42] other things I'm I enjoy doing right now
[00:47:45] yeah that's what it happens is you know
[00:47:47] you're good at one thing but eventually
[00:47:49] someone gets better than you and it's
[00:47:51] you the time you could you could solve
[00:47:54] set a world record for solving the rub
[00:47:55] Rubik's Cube somebody someday will break
[00:47:58] it yeah you know okay live with it
[00:48:00] that's
[00:48:01] fine that's awesome so we can wrap up
[00:48:04] soon I I've had you for a long time I
[00:48:06] feel really honored um oh this been
[00:48:07] great fun yeah that's good but tell me
[00:48:09] about your your new book um thank you um
[00:48:13] so
[00:48:14] so it m so my first book was really
[00:48:18] getting people excited about a rithmetic
[00:48:20] you know mental and arithmetic and
[00:48:22] otherwise um and my second book is
[00:48:25] really what goes beyond arithmetic so
[00:48:28] you know the the math that we see in
[00:48:31] your in school in Middle School in high
[00:48:34] school whether it be algebra geometry
[00:48:36] trigonometry calculus Pi Infinity
[00:48:40] Fibonacci numbers you know the some of
[00:48:44] that's important math and some of it's
[00:48:46] just beautiful math and I I feel that um
[00:48:50] especially nowadays with all this
[00:48:51] emphasis on testing a lot of the fun
[00:48:54] stuff has just been cut out of the
[00:48:56] picture so this was my attempt at
[00:49:00] teaching math to the masses in what I
[00:49:02] think is a
[00:49:04] fun uh magical way so it's called The
[00:49:07] Magic of math solving for x and figuring
[00:49:10] out why which very proud of the subtitle
[00:49:14] thank you and um and you know I want
[00:49:18] people to to to see there's more to math
[00:49:21] than just slogging through equations and
[00:49:24] yet I teach you introduce you to all the
[00:49:27] important stuff but I want to fill it
[00:49:29] with the fun stuff as well so that's
[00:49:31] been um and to and I'm very pleasantly
[00:49:35] surprised it's gotten off to a very
[00:49:37] strong start it made the New York Times
[00:49:40] bestseller list for education in
[00:49:42] September the month that came out it's
[00:49:44] uh it'll come out in paperback in the
[00:49:47] fall of uh 200 uh 16 and um you know I'm
[00:49:54] I'm hopeful that
[00:49:56] uh I mean my first book still continues
[00:49:58] to sell well and I think it will outlive
[00:50:01] me um I hope this other book does as
[00:50:04] well but we'll see let's good yeah I
[00:50:06] have it downloaded on my Kindle I'm
[00:50:07] gonna good get into it I have to finish
[00:50:10] a couple other books
[00:50:11] but but anyways thank you so much for uh
[00:50:14] taking an hour out of your day to speak
[00:50:16] to me um it's so exciting to talk to you
[00:50:19] I mean I I read your book way back when
[00:50:22] and I here I am with you well it's a
[00:50:24] it's a it's delightful to know that my
[00:50:27] my my book my my work my ideas you know
[00:50:31] continue to live on and uh get people
[00:50:35] like yourself and your listeners to um
[00:50:39] you know enjoy life in a new way so
[00:50:42] there you go well good um I'll I'll
[00:50:44] share links to your book and and your
[00:50:46] website in in the description below and
[00:50:49] you know you seem like a very open
[00:50:51] person to reach out to if anybody's
[00:50:53] interested absolutely I I if we if we
[00:50:55] make it to if I make it to Vegas in
[00:50:56] October I'll I'll be in touch and we'll
[00:50:59] we'll get together what we've done I
[00:51:01] assume was was that entirely an audio
[00:51:03] podcast or was that a video podcast no
[00:51:05] we'll do it's video as well oh okay good
[00:51:08] so I I talked as if it were video but
[00:51:10] then you said podcast so I thought oh
[00:51:11] maybe I split them up so it'll be
[00:51:13] podcast as well oh great great app all
[00:51:15] right Nelson wonderful talking with you
[00:51:17] and uh let me know when you put it up
[00:51:20] perfect I will take care byebye
[00:51:24] bye

[00:00:17] your software to improve your memory so
[00:00:20] let's dive deep inside my brain to find
[00:00:22] out how it all
[00:00:23] [Music]
[00:00:26] works hi you've made it welcome to my
[00:00:30] brain let's learn how to remember a list
[00:00:32] of things the key to remembering things
[00:00:34] is to make them Unforgettable turn them
[00:00:36] into pictures that are bizarre gross
[00:00:39] funny anything memorable and different
[00:00:42] let's pick 10 random words from a
[00:00:46] magazine uh milk
[00:00:50] Sun uh hamburgers
[00:00:53] apples sock
[00:00:56] crib book corn
[00:01:01] chicken and uh
[00:01:04] bomb if I were to take that list away
[00:01:06] would you remember
[00:01:08] it maybe the first three or four but
[00:01:10] without a memory upgrade chances are
[00:01:13] you've already forgotten the last few to
[00:01:15] remember all 10 words link all of your
[00:01:17] images into one crazy imaginative story
[00:01:20] that connects them all together this is
[00:01:23] milk not very memorable though let's try
[00:01:26] that
[00:01:28] again
[00:01:30] [Music]
[00:01:39] [Music]
[00:01:41] son hamburgers
[00:01:44] yum apples no no no Angry
[00:01:50] apples hold on you can do
[00:01:53] better much better socks oops
[00:01:58] crib sorry sry about
[00:02:05] that
[00:02:10] corn chicken get out of here
[00:02:14] chicken
[00:02:18] seriously
[00:02:22] bomb done so our story goes I milk a cow
[00:02:26] by pumping its tail and then the Sun
[00:02:28] comes out and Cooks the cow cow until it
[00:02:30] bursts into hamburgers clouds cover the
[00:02:32] sun and it starts raining apples angry
[00:02:35] apples then I throw a disgusting sock
[00:02:37] into a baby's crib the baby hits me on
[00:02:39] the back of the head with a book which
[00:02:41] lands on the floor corn grows out of it
[00:02:43] chicken walks out and starts eating the
[00:02:45] corn chew it away then a bomb blows up
[00:02:47] the chicken Unforgettable even when the
[00:02:50] words are
[00:02:51] gone anybody can have an amazing memory
[00:02:54] after all we've all got basically the
[00:02:56] same Hardware now as you can see a
[00:02:58] simple upgrade of your software can make
[00:03:00] all the difference in the world I'm

=== Nelson Dellis' MIND SHOW - David Leibovitch // Musical Prodigy ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMj9L8DdEqU

[00:00:06] [Music]
[00:00:15] thank you everybody for joining us we
[00:00:17] have a very special guest one of my best
[00:00:19] friends David David liovic uh he's
[00:00:23] French we grew up together went to same
[00:00:26] high school went to college together
[00:00:28] studied physics together a lot of nerdy
[00:00:30] things together and um a lot of you
[00:00:34] probably every one of you who's
[00:00:35] listening or watching doesn't know who
[00:00:37] he is but um he's on the show because he
[00:00:39] has the skill we like to call it a
[00:00:42] superpower sometimes um that he can he
[00:00:45] has Perfect Pitch right um so I wanted
[00:00:49] to ask him a bunch of questions about it
[00:00:51] I've always found it fascinating um you
[00:00:53] know he's able to tell what note is what
[00:00:56] that's what Perfect Pitch is um but
[00:00:59] we'll talk more about that later David
[00:01:01] how you doing good thanks for having me
[00:01:04] Nelson this is weird I usually interview
[00:01:06] people that are like I don't know that
[00:01:09] well and then here you are I'm honored
[00:01:11] this is this is great thanks for coming
[00:01:14] on here I mean part of the the show that
[00:01:17] I'm doing you know I like having people
[00:01:19] that are famous for what they do but
[00:01:22] also kind of like regular you're not
[00:01:24] regular but like people who do everyday
[00:01:27] work and aren't known for their skill
[00:01:29] but have these skill
[00:01:30] anyways um so I guess to start off cuz I
[00:01:34] know you but nobody out there knows you
[00:01:36] tell me like a little bit of your
[00:01:37] background like where you're from what
[00:01:39] you studied when this skill came around
[00:01:44] sure um so uh as you know I grew up in
[00:01:48] France um studied music studied the
[00:01:52] violin since I was four years old um and
[00:01:56] uh studied music theory also from a very
[00:01:59] young age uhhuh um a lot of sulage we
[00:02:03] call suage in France what is that like
[00:02:06] music theory and some singing and um a
[00:02:10] big part of that is uh we do musical
[00:02:14] dictations okay and so the instructor
[00:02:18] instru the instructor plays a uh piece
[00:02:21] of music and then you have to be able to
[00:02:23] write it down just by ear what the notes
[00:02:26] are right yeah right right right what
[00:02:27] the notes are and then it can be one
[00:02:30] voice can be multiple voices
[00:02:32] cans and so that's only I trained for
[00:02:34] yeah and um that was obviously a big
[00:02:38] part
[00:02:39] of you what what contributed to me
[00:02:42] exactly yeah uh but for your listeners I
[00:02:45] don't want your listeners know what
[00:02:45] perfect [ __ ] is yeah so yeah please
[00:02:48] explain I mean I said it in the quick
[00:02:50] version but there's probably a little
[00:02:51] more to it so go ahead well I mean I'm
[00:02:53] no exper in it basically I mean from
[00:02:56] what I understand it's it's a little bit
[00:02:58] like being able to recognize
[00:03:01] colors so but music exactly so you know
[00:03:05] from a very young age you're taught that
[00:03:07] certain frequency of light is you know
[00:03:10] red other frequency of light is blue
[00:03:12] exactly and so it's the same thing
[00:03:15] you're you're just kind of get used to
[00:03:17] putting a label on certain frequencies
[00:03:19] of sound right so you hear you know what
[00:03:23] someone on the on the on the piano might
[00:03:25] press as a middle C and you recognize
[00:03:29] from the sound even without looking at
[00:03:31] the person it jumps out on me I don't
[00:03:33] have to like think about it I just I
[00:03:35] actually hear the name of the note in
[00:03:37] French which is so it's like you
[00:03:41] know I don't hear
[00:03:43] ABCD ABCD FG but I hear so you hear you
[00:03:47] hear a voice in your head that says hey
[00:03:50] David the answer is it's basically a
[00:03:54] voice yeah that's crazy I mean I can't
[00:03:56] put
[00:03:57] a I mean it doesn't sound like a person
[00:04:00] but it sounds like almost like a voice
[00:04:02] somebody saying the the name that's
[00:04:04] interesting okay so I mean I guess we
[00:04:07] can because just to test you um not that
[00:04:10] I don't believe you but just so people
[00:04:13] can um believe this and we can get
[00:04:15] started and go deeper into this I have
[00:04:17] this little melodica it's like a
[00:04:19] harmonica keyboard make sure we're not
[00:04:20] faking this yeah yeah okay so I'm just
[00:04:22] going to play a couple notes single
[00:04:24] notes and you just tell me what they are
[00:04:26] yeah I'm sure you don't have to train
[00:04:28] you don't have to warm up for this do
[00:04:29] you no so like that's so like there's
[00:04:31] like perfect [ __ ] where you don't have
[00:04:33] to uh you know calibrate your yeah
[00:04:36] hearing and then there's like relative
[00:04:38] pitch oh yeah that that's a little bit I
[00:04:40] think easier to train for and uh for
[00:04:43] that people have to um have recently
[00:04:47] heard a note that they know the name of
[00:04:51] like a reference point yeah a reference
[00:04:53] point so that right and then like in you
[00:04:55] know within the next couple hours they
[00:04:56] can tell you what notes being played
[00:04:59] yeah based off of that so I would play
[00:05:01] like a c I'd say this is a c they would
[00:05:04] hear the C and then from that point they
[00:05:07] can say oh like this is a little higher
[00:05:09] that's probably an e and so on
[00:05:11] interesting and and I think for for
[00:05:13] perfect [ __ ] I think for absolute for
[00:05:16] relative pitch anybody can train for it
[00:05:19] and I think for perfect pitch or what's
[00:05:20] also called absolute pitch there may be
[00:05:23] some genetic predispositions that you
[00:05:25] think so well from what I read online I
[00:05:28] don't really know yeah uh but there
[00:05:30] there may be some genetic
[00:05:32] predispositions that make it easier for
[00:05:33] you to yeah to do this interesting all
[00:05:36] right we'll go into that but here here
[00:05:37] we go all
[00:05:39] right all right it's a g it is a g in
[00:05:43] fact all
[00:05:45] right that's an A flat yeah all
[00:05:50] right it's a d
[00:05:54] yeah F but I hear like so what I what I
[00:05:58] hear is I hear like f you know like I
[00:06:02] hear with the voice yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:06:05] so okay so the voice in your head isn't
[00:06:07] just saying the word but it's actually
[00:06:09] saying it at that pitch yeah it's
[00:06:12] like is it a man or a woman is it you
[00:06:15] who is it uh I don't know who it is okay
[00:06:18] okay but that's funny I mean if it's a
[00:06:23] really high pitch note it's probably
[00:06:24] some kind of woman and if it's low it's
[00:06:26] a dude I would think so yeah yeah all
[00:06:28] right uh can I play two notes at the
[00:06:30] same time sure all right I haven't done
[00:06:33] this in a while but we'll
[00:06:37] try that's F sharp and a yeah nice uh
[00:06:41] let me try another
[00:06:46] one I have to translate to English but
[00:06:49] it's like D and E flat yeah yeah yeah
[00:06:53] that's awesome all right I'm going to do
[00:06:54] three oh God all right let's try let's
[00:06:58] try
[00:07:04] c e g yeah that was a c chord yeah all
[00:07:08] right let's try
[00:07:12] this that's a that's G B flat c yeah
[00:07:18] awesome one thing I love
[00:07:20] about you and and when we we grew up you
[00:07:23] told me this is like I don't know if I
[00:07:26] exaggerated this over the years but like
[00:07:28] if you heard like a song like Mary had a
[00:07:32] little lamb right and you it doesn't
[00:07:35] finish or it ends on the wrong note like
[00:07:38] it's really troubling for you right like
[00:07:41] yeah it's annoying let me see if I can
[00:07:44] do it more having to
[00:07:52] all that hurts right it does
[00:07:57] hurt anyway so okay so that that's
[00:08:00] that's amazing um so I play guitar right
[00:08:03] or not as much as I used to but I can I
[00:08:07] I think some I have a very
[00:08:09] minuscule um uh relative pitch because a
[00:08:13] lot of especially rock is is based
[00:08:15] around e since that's the low chord so a
[00:08:19] lot of songs I can just kind of hear I
[00:08:22] know that's an e it feels like an e and
[00:08:24] then I can kind of figure out where the
[00:08:26] notes lie after that not like I can't
[00:08:29] shout him out but I can kind of figure
[00:08:30] him out real quick but uh having it
[00:08:33] absolute um is crazy so
[00:08:37] you I've I've heard that too that it's
[00:08:40] it's genetic um or or partly genetic but
[00:08:43] I mean could you you can't argue I mean
[00:08:45] it seems like you had a very rigorous
[00:08:48] musical upbringing yeah right I did and
[00:08:53] that's definitely a big part of it yeah
[00:08:54] I mean because part of it part of the
[00:08:57] training was to actually sing
[00:09:00] saying the name of the note that you're
[00:09:01] singing yeah so so you you played violin
[00:09:05] no nothing
[00:09:06] else uh well I play a little bit of
[00:09:08] piano here and there but no no rigors
[00:09:11] okay which I guess violin is also a good
[00:09:13] instrument to practice on because it's
[00:09:15] not like piano you press a note and
[00:09:16] there it is you really have to find the
[00:09:19] hair of that specific uh pitch if you
[00:09:22] want it otherwise it's flat it's sharp
[00:09:24] sounds exactly exactly you have to be
[00:09:26] able to adjust your intonation
[00:09:30] yeah yeah yeah okay so what age did you
[00:09:34] start anything
[00:09:35] musical
[00:09:37] um I don't know exactly uh I was about 4
[00:09:42] 4 and a half when I started the violin
[00:09:44] okay but I you know I was exposed to
[00:09:46] music before that sure sure are your
[00:09:49] parents musical yeah my dad my mom paid
[00:09:53] the piano and my dad played the violin
[00:09:55] so he's the one who taught me for the
[00:09:56] first couple years okay and um when you
[00:10:01] so did they they encouraged you to start
[00:10:03] playing right it wasn't a personal
[00:10:05] choice
[00:10:06] right I mean it's hard to know what
[00:10:10] personal choices are at that age I guess
[00:10:12] I guess yeah right right but I mean I I
[00:10:14] was made to play piano and I I think I
[00:10:16] liked it the first year but then
[00:10:17] afterwards practice for me was like you
[00:10:20] have to claw my it was like clawing my
[00:10:23] eyes out it was it was you couldn't get
[00:10:25] me to do it and you're not going to get
[00:10:27] better that way so you must have enjoyed
[00:10:29] on some level yeah yeah I mean I I went
[00:10:31] through phases I think there were some
[00:10:33] phases where I I was kind of made to
[00:10:36] practice because I I wanted to do other
[00:10:38] things but I mean I really enjoyed it
[00:10:41] all
[00:10:41] throughout yeah yeah yeah yeah and then
[00:10:44] so
[00:10:45] how I mean did you have a when you
[00:10:47] started doing this at four years old was
[00:10:49] it obvious that you had a talent for it
[00:10:53] or it's just something that came you
[00:10:55] know with all the practice hours that
[00:10:57] came with it I think other people go
[00:10:59] through the kind of training that I went
[00:11:01] through and don't end up having Perfect
[00:11:04] Pitch okay really good version of
[00:11:07] absolute of a relative pitch I see a
[00:11:09] really good ability to relate one to the
[00:11:12] other yeah but so I think I think
[00:11:17] there's that's why I think there's maybe
[00:11:18] a little bit of genetic
[00:11:20] component yeah yeah definitely um so
[00:11:23] that that was a big factor it's not just
[00:11:26] being able to tell what the note is it's
[00:11:27] also I hear a piece of music I can tell
[00:11:30] what the key is you know like what scale
[00:11:32] oh yeah is being used like if I hear
[00:11:36] violin conero I can tell that it's you
[00:11:39] know in C major GM whatever yeah that's
[00:11:42] crazy and have you um have you ever met
[00:11:44] anybody else with this skill like in
[00:11:46] regular day life where you're like oh I
[00:11:50] I have that too you know uh I met one
[00:11:53] person it was actually in the physics F
[00:11:56] okay in in college yeah really who
[00:12:00] do you remember
[00:12:01] Carl Carl no I don't know uh he maybe he
[00:12:05] came in
[00:12:07] later think okay oh anyway yeah but so
[00:12:10] he had absolute pitch just like
[00:12:13] you yeah you're a little
[00:12:16] better I don't know it was a little
[00:12:18] different but he he had some kind of
[00:12:21] absolute [ __ ] yeah interesting okay
[00:12:23] that's funny um when did you first um
[00:12:28] actually realize that you had this skill
[00:12:30] or was it just always obvious uh it's
[00:12:33] just it I don't you know maybe it was I
[00:12:37] was maybe s years old or 8 years old
[00:12:40] when it started becoming obvious that
[00:12:43] that I had this but I mean the
[00:12:44] realization isn't like uh like Peter
[00:12:47] Parker Spider-Man where he's suddenly
[00:12:48] like oh my God if I put my hand against
[00:12:50] this wall I can actually climb up it
[00:12:53] it's more like X-Men that it's kind of a
[00:12:55] taboo when you're growing up and okay
[00:12:58] you kind of like keep it bottled in but
[00:13:00] you know you can do it exactly that's
[00:13:03] interesting that's so cool I would love
[00:13:05] to have that skill it seems like a not
[00:13:08] pointless I mean if you're a musician
[00:13:10] it's not pointless at all but if you're
[00:13:12] otherwise it's kind of is but it's it's
[00:13:14] it's I think a cool thing to be able to
[00:13:16] point out oh this is that note this is
[00:13:17] that that's is sharp this is flat but
[00:13:20] from what I understand is that it
[00:13:21] actually can be a a bit of a burden
[00:13:24] sometimes right like it can be really
[00:13:26] troubling cuz you hear these that voice
[00:13:29] in your head is always playing for music
[00:13:31] right right so if I play music you just
[00:13:34] can't help hearing that and translating
[00:13:37] those those notes that musical Beauty to
[00:13:40] words and and and letters I don't know
[00:13:43] what it's like to listen to a piece of
[00:13:46] music without hearing those voices in my
[00:13:49] head that's so sad I'm sorry it is so
[00:13:53] because okay so I hear one of my the
[00:13:55] most beautiful like I used to play cello
[00:13:58] a little bit
[00:13:59] um so I love this piece by c s uh the
[00:14:04] the swan do you know that one he has a
[00:14:07] whole he has a whole it's like all the
[00:14:09] animals right the Carnival of the
[00:14:10] animals there's even a violin one I play
[00:14:14] this but it's how is it it's like this
[00:14:16] yeah um you know what I'm talking about
[00:14:20] yeah I I know the of the piece before I
[00:14:23] don't remember what it sound but anyways
[00:14:24] it's like one of these pieces it's
[00:14:26] usually a cello and a piano and and it
[00:14:29] just is
[00:14:30] really ah it hits these notes and you
[00:14:33] almost could cry in the if you're in the
[00:14:35] right mood you know but like I sit there
[00:14:38] and I just like absorb it you know like
[00:14:40] and when people go to concertos and
[00:14:43] operas that's what they do you know it
[00:14:44] gets in them it it makes them emotional
[00:14:46] but can you feel that same thing or is
[00:14:49] this oh sure yeah okay okay absolutely
[00:14:53] right so it doesn't take away from
[00:14:55] enjoying music I see okay uh yeah to its
[00:15:00] full extent getting shivers down your
[00:15:02] spine okay listening to a piece of music
[00:15:04] yeah you I still get all those things
[00:15:07] okay that's good um the the it was
[00:15:11] interesting you were telling me the
[00:15:12] other day about rock music though I'd
[00:15:14] love for you to share that story again
[00:15:16] oh right
[00:15:17] so yeah you know when I was growing up I
[00:15:20] was basically listening to classical
[00:15:21] music yeah uh some you know pop songs
[00:15:25] but I was mostly focused on classical um
[00:15:29] and so yeah I moved to the US when I was
[00:15:31] you know 14 years old went to high
[00:15:33] school in the US and uh so one of the
[00:15:36] things that I started listening to in
[00:15:37] high school was kind of new rock yeah
[00:15:41] basically '90s Rock maybe like early
[00:15:44] 2000 and so what like ACDC Metallica
[00:15:50] Nana radio head stuff like that very
[00:15:53] like grungy distorted crunchy stuff
[00:15:57] exactly and so part of the appeal was
[00:15:59] exactly that that it was a lot of it was
[00:16:01] distorted was screechy it was so like
[00:16:04] there were sounds that were coming out
[00:16:06] more as noise than than notes yeah or
[00:16:09] like there were between two notes so I
[00:16:12] was able to like hear that
[00:16:15] without the label right right right so
[00:16:18] you were almost like they put blinders
[00:16:21] on you and you could actually I was
[00:16:23] Escaping The Perfect Pitch world and
[00:16:26] enjoying music without labels that's
[00:16:29] crazy so that much that must actually
[00:16:31] have made the music even more like
[00:16:33] pleasing to you right or like Curious
[00:16:36] yeah yeah yeah I think I think it did
[00:16:40] yeah that's so
[00:16:42] cool that was part of the
[00:16:45] appeal
[00:16:47] um one thing that I wanted to see if you
[00:16:50] could if you remembered is
[00:16:52] um do you remember when I was trying to
[00:16:56] uh train myself to recognize the the
[00:16:59] frequency of a phone dial tone yes oh
[00:17:03] yeah that's right and I never got around
[00:17:05] to doing it so like on a phone you've
[00:17:07] got you know 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 and zero
[00:17:10] and so each row corresponds to a certain
[00:17:14] frequency and then each column on the on
[00:17:16] the dial pad is another
[00:17:19] frequency and so then like basically
[00:17:22] each so you could tell what phone number
[00:17:24] was being dialed exactly I could do it
[00:17:27] because the thing like those frequencies
[00:17:29] didn't they were like between notes so I
[00:17:32] couldn't I wasn't getting a label oh
[00:17:35] yeah it was like a specific cfcg it was
[00:17:38] like between two notes so it was harder
[00:17:41] it was like Out Of Tune yeah yeah I'm
[00:17:43] curious if it's still uh oh here's my
[00:17:46] phone hold on I don't know if the
[00:17:48] iPhones these days I think if you turn
[00:17:50] on
[00:17:52] uh my text here all right let's see
[00:17:56] um that's not very
[00:18:00] loud that's the same sound
[00:18:05] right there you go that's a cool yeah I
[00:18:08] remember when you were doing that that
[00:18:09] seem so crazy so you would try to be
[00:18:11] able to like listen to someone dial a
[00:18:13] phone number and you'd be like ah 305 so
[00:18:16] I think what you just dialed was like
[00:18:18] right
[00:18:20] column uh right right left right
[00:18:25] center left Center
[00:18:30] oh yeah I wow yeah yeah yeah but I
[00:18:33] couldn't hear the other note oh I see
[00:18:36] the the actual so you know which row it
[00:18:38] is yeah so I I did a 3 three I put two
[00:18:42] threes back in 330 five so right right
[00:18:46] middle middle uh 6 six right right left
[00:18:50] seven yeah that's pretty
[00:18:54] good um so that's fascinating I those
[00:18:58] little stories are really funny one of
[00:19:00] the the best memories whenever I tell
[00:19:02] people you have this skill I jump to
[00:19:04] this memory um because we took physics
[00:19:07] together and we had this one teacher who
[00:19:09] I loved but uh he could be a bit boring
[00:19:13] and long- winded and you know we'd find
[00:19:15] ourselves like kind of messing around
[00:19:17] remember
[00:19:19] mesu I was going to say we won't say his
[00:19:21] name yeah okay I'll beat that out um but
[00:19:24] anyway so we'd be sitting there we'd be
[00:19:27] doing whatever things I'd be
[00:19:28] writing numers down drawing and you'd be
[00:19:30] doing whatever but I remember you move
[00:19:33] the chair you know these little desk
[00:19:34] chairs um that you have in college and
[00:19:37] it like rubbed against the floor and uh
[00:19:40] I remember you pausing and just being
[00:19:41] like ah that was a I don't know what the
[00:19:44] note was like a f SHP or something um
[00:19:47] and then it's just like you hear the
[00:19:49] noises um just regular notes that happen
[00:19:53] in everyday life whether it's like the
[00:19:54] hit of a glass um or a moving of a chair
[00:19:58] or exactly which is fascinating because
[00:20:00] I would never notice what yeah it's not
[00:20:03] just instruments it's like any sound
[00:20:05] that happens to be a a single frequency
[00:20:07] or mainly a single frequency yeah yeah
[00:20:09] yeah and I remember trying to understand
[00:20:11] the difference between like what's noise
[00:20:15] and what's actually a note because if I
[00:20:17] scratch a keyboard I mean a Blackboard
[00:20:20] you know to me that's just noise or if I
[00:20:22] rub against the floor that's just noise
[00:20:24] but sometimes buried in there or
[00:20:27] actually the whole thing is a note right
[00:20:29] or a mix of
[00:20:31] notes right yeah so like what makes a
[00:20:33] note is that there's a predominant
[00:20:37] frequency okay at a single okay so it's
[00:20:41] not yeah okay
[00:20:43] yeah it's almost like
[00:20:45] a not a wave packet but the superos
[00:20:49] noise is like a superp position of of a
[00:20:52] bunch of frequencies yeah and it's just
[00:20:54] very chaotic so everything is noise but
[00:20:58] there are specific noises that gather
[00:21:02] together in this frequency right if you
[00:21:05] if there's some predominant frequency
[00:21:07] that's louder than the others then then
[00:21:10] you'll you'll hear the noises in not but
[00:21:12] it it's crazy to think like why would me
[00:21:14] pressing on this
[00:21:16] Center thing while blowing into it
[00:21:19] creates that whereas if I scratch on the
[00:21:21] Blackboard it doesn't you know like who
[00:21:24] decides
[00:21:26] that I mean you know like for the
[00:21:28] keyboard I guess it's some it seems to
[00:21:31] be electronic right or no actually no no
[00:21:34] it's just air yeah I don't know how that
[00:21:36] thing works but uh but I'm talking from
[00:21:38] like a very meta version like oh right
[00:21:42] right right
[00:21:44] right mystery you don't have to I know
[00:21:46] you don't have the answer that's fine I
[00:21:48] don't know I mean you know there are
[00:21:50] like natural frequency certain objects
[00:21:51] have natural
[00:21:53] frequencies where like a certain
[00:21:55] frequency will kind of resonate better
[00:21:57] than the others yeah right that yeah but
[00:22:01] I don't think that answers your question
[00:22:03] no but it's just a thing to think about
[00:22:05] I guess and kind of stare into space and
[00:22:08] wonder um okay next question is uh do
[00:22:11] you so take me all right I have some
[00:22:13] musical background um you know I can't
[00:22:17] do what you do um but I know music um
[00:22:21] could you teach me this like if you took
[00:22:23] me under your wing and we trained
[00:22:26] however much necessary
[00:22:28] could you coach me to have this skill
[00:22:30] what do you
[00:22:33] think I think uh that it that may depend
[00:22:38] on maybe some genetic factors I don't
[00:22:41] know right okay uh but assuming that
[00:22:45] that's not a
[00:22:46] problem uh I think so from what I read
[00:22:48] it's easier at a young age yeah okay
[00:22:52] just
[00:22:52] like you know I think different cultures
[00:22:55] have different labels for different
[00:22:56] colors right cultures put two colors
[00:23:00] together and call that one color or they
[00:23:03] have they see five different colors in
[00:23:05] what we call blue or sure okay right so
[00:23:08] it it'd be a little bit like
[00:23:10] retraining the way you almost the way
[00:23:13] you see colors yeah yeah or training you
[00:23:16] to to be able to have a wider palette of
[00:23:21] colors that you right so where you used
[00:23:24] to know blue now you got to be able to
[00:23:26] like disseminate between 10 different
[00:23:29] Blues now suddenly it's SP out into this
[00:23:32] wider range of colors I think that if
[00:23:35] you know every day or almost every day
[00:23:37] you you try to do you know at first you
[00:23:40] do a
[00:23:41] simple uh you try to recognize you know
[00:23:43] you listen to like a for example the not
[00:23:46] a and then you just listen to it every
[00:23:49] day and and every time uh you get back
[00:23:53] to it the next day you you try to sing
[00:23:56] an a without this to it first yeah
[00:24:00] eventually you'll get better at it and
[00:24:03] right that's the training part yeah and
[00:24:05] then you can start adding more notes got
[00:24:08] it yeah I I guess it comes down to like
[00:24:10] how much you want it as well like people
[00:24:12] always ask me about the memory thing and
[00:24:15] I don't think there's much genetic there
[00:24:17] um but you know people say like can you
[00:24:19] teach me I'm like yeah sure I really
[00:24:21] think that anybody can do what I can do
[00:24:23] but no not everybody's going to be like
[00:24:26] the champion right nobody's going to be
[00:24:28] the best setting records and stuff like
[00:24:29] that and what's the difference it's
[00:24:31] because I mean you you were committed
[00:24:33] 100% I wanted it right like even though
[00:24:36] people come to me asking and they want
[00:24:38] it it's a different kind of want you
[00:24:40] know like yeah to sit there and and
[00:24:42] train yourself and for it to consume you
[00:24:45] and be all that you think about as much
[00:24:47] as you want it it may it may not
[00:24:49] manifest itself within you the same way
[00:24:51] as it did for me um and you won't get to
[00:24:54] that place you'll get good but not David
[00:24:59] style I mean it was a huge commitment
[00:25:01] cuz growing up I mean I was practicing
[00:25:03] every day I had you know weekly I had a
[00:25:05] violin lessine and then I had a music
[00:25:08] theory basically yeah Lon uh so it was
[00:25:11] really just part of who I was growing up
[00:25:14] yeah wait does your father or mother
[00:25:16] have perfect pitch too I don't think so
[00:25:19] okay uh I think my dad maybe a little
[00:25:23] bit but it's he didn't go through the
[00:25:26] same rigorous
[00:25:28] yeah is he a good violinist are you are
[00:25:30] you guys comparable or are you better uh
[00:25:32] no I mean he was really good uh he he
[00:25:35] kind of stopped playing before I was
[00:25:37] born you know and then he kind of got
[00:25:38] back into it with me yeah but you know
[00:25:41] he he was very good when he was younger
[00:25:44] now here's another question can you be a
[00:25:45] very very good professional musician and
[00:25:49] not have this
[00:25:51] skill I think so yeah really yeah I
[00:25:55] think so I mean I I know musicians who
[00:25:59] just have really good relative [ __ ] Rel
[00:26:02] L of my teachers my U violin teachers
[00:26:05] didn't have perfect pitch wow but they
[00:26:08] had really good relative pitch
[00:26:10] interesting that's crazy so yeah no
[00:26:13] definitely it's not a a must I give it's
[00:26:16] a bonus but it's not a must yeah yeah
[00:26:19] okay interesting yeah one of my you know
[00:26:21] that guitarist belli lran from the he
[00:26:25] does like gypsy jazz stuff so he grew up
[00:26:28] like um uh with the gypsies right in in
[00:26:31] Belgium and uh he is it's incredible the
[00:26:36] kind of solos he comes up with and the
[00:26:38] chords and and everything is just so
[00:26:41] interesting all the time he improvises
[00:26:42] so amazingly and the interesting about
[00:26:44] him is he doesn't know the names any of
[00:26:46] the notes uh he was never shown that he
[00:26:48] had to learn just by ear from everybody
[00:26:50] else playing around him and um you know
[00:26:53] if you ask him like what's he playing he
[00:26:56] can't tell you but he can like figure
[00:26:58] out the most complex interesting
[00:27:00] overlaying and patterns that match and
[00:27:03] you know oppose these these core
[00:27:05] progressions it's crazy you know that's
[00:27:08] amazing I mean from my experience it's
[00:27:12] it's pretty easy for me to listen to a
[00:27:14] song and then just play it on the piano
[00:27:17] or viol or whatever but improvisation
[00:27:20] has always been a problem for me oh
[00:27:22] that's interesting okay and maybe it has
[00:27:24] to do with maybe it has to do with
[00:27:27] perfect actually it probably has to do
[00:27:28] with the fact that I just wasn't it
[00:27:30] wasn't part of what I was doing when I
[00:27:32] was playing VI too yeah I mean violin is
[00:27:34] you were playing like very right
[00:27:38] composed pieces and you followed along
[00:27:40] and that was it right you play you learn
[00:27:42] that and then you improvise the feelings
[00:27:45] and the the emotion of those that set of
[00:27:47] notes right yeah exactly and but I think
[00:27:51] part of it may also be that I'm I just
[00:27:54] I'm always thinking about the name of
[00:27:55] the notes I'm playing yeah and maybe
[00:27:57] it's
[00:27:58] slowing me down or that's interesting
[00:28:01] yeah cuz you see some like jazz or or
[00:28:05] Rock soloists uh doing a crazy solo and
[00:28:08] it's just like they look like they lose
[00:28:10] themselves and they just feel it you
[00:28:12] know it's like they probably don't even
[00:28:13] know they just it's just a feeling
[00:28:16] whereas you yeah you'd be thinking like
[00:28:18] okay what's next is it you know D me you
[00:28:20] know like I can imagine that totally
[00:28:23] removes the the quality of an improvised
[00:28:25] solo you know right
[00:28:28] interesting that's so funny
[00:28:32] um what
[00:28:37] else yeah so I would love to play like a
[00:28:40] couple songs just random songs and for
[00:28:43] you to tell me like what key it's in or
[00:28:46] something okay sure cuz I remember there
[00:28:48] was a couple instances where I'd show
[00:28:50] you like a song I liked or whatever and
[00:28:53] you'd be like um oh I can't listen to
[00:28:56] this it's actually a little
[00:28:58] sharp right oh right like if like the
[00:29:01] instrument is completely like tuned yeah
[00:29:03] they're tuned wrong or I don't notice it
[00:29:06] Mo most every ear won't notice it but
[00:29:08] you are like that is a slight sharp uh
[00:29:13] every's tuned up which is like Mary had
[00:29:15] a little lamb like if it's kind of the
[00:29:17] wrong notes or it's like slightly off
[00:29:20] that just drives you mad right yeah and
[00:29:23] also if if it's like a well-known song
[00:29:26] that's you know that has a key and
[00:29:28] you're playing in a different key that
[00:29:30] usually also bothers me oh I see yeah
[00:29:33] yeah cuz you're used to hearing it the
[00:29:34] one way and then suddenly it's like yeah
[00:29:36] it's like
[00:29:38] transposed so do you know off the top of
[00:29:40] your head any songs that um are famous
[00:29:45] but are like horribly Out Of
[00:29:49] Tune I'm trying to
[00:29:54] think yeah I mean you know there's some
[00:29:58] just there are some rock songs that you
[00:30:01] know where like the solos are just off
[00:30:04] but I still love the songs yeah yeah
[00:30:06] yeah and sometimes it actually sounds
[00:30:09] there because it's a little bit Out Of
[00:30:11] Tune I see yeah that's part of the charm
[00:30:13] of the song right yeah yeah yeah
[00:30:16] interesting hold on I'm trying to load a
[00:30:17] song here um let's see I'll use
[00:30:22] this do you have any like interesting
[00:30:25] stories that you remember that
[00:30:27] the perfect pitch kind of comes into
[00:30:29] play uh so
[00:30:33] uh yeah
[00:30:36] so we were in the physics lab so we used
[00:30:39] to work in this physics cos cosmology
[00:30:41] astrophysics lab right at un yeah we had
[00:30:46] this lab uh it was probably the most
[00:30:47] prolific experimental lab in in the
[00:30:49] University of Miami physics department
[00:30:52] that's what it felt like and one half
[00:30:54] was uh this teacher Professor Gallia who
[00:30:57] was doing he had like a what do you call
[00:31:00] it
[00:31:01] um a fridge basically a device that went
[00:31:05] down to close to absolute zero and the
[00:31:08] idea was that it could detect x-rays in
[00:31:10] space that was our side and the other
[00:31:12] half was Dr Gerson and what did he do he
[00:31:15] had a mirror cosmology so we we analyzed
[00:31:17] data from we detected and analyzed data
[00:31:20] from the cosmic microwave Cosmic
[00:31:23] microwave background yeah uh so
[00:31:26] different Google that if you don't know
[00:31:28] what that is it's interesting I'm
[00:31:30] telling the listeners to Google a m
[00:31:31] Cosmic microwave background yes
[00:31:34] CNB it's really cool it's like a picture
[00:31:37] of the
[00:31:38] universe I think 300,000 years after the
[00:31:42] big bang because there was a u that's
[00:31:45] when there was an expansion of of space
[00:31:49] yeah and time I don't know if I remember
[00:31:52] this correctly but basically the light
[00:31:55] from uh from that moment is still
[00:31:57] reaching us
[00:31:58] today at a at a frequency that was red
[00:32:01] shifted to uh millimet waves and
[00:32:06] microwaves and that's what the what he
[00:32:09] was looking for is this this sound right
[00:32:12] quotequote actually that that was one of
[00:32:14] the one of the ideas yeah but uh I mean
[00:32:17] most of it was just analyzing the the
[00:32:20] data itself yeah yeah yeah all right so
[00:32:22] there so there we were in those labs
[00:32:24] what's the memory you have uh so we had
[00:32:27] this uh you know we had all these
[00:32:29] computers and these uh all these
[00:32:32] different instruments electronic
[00:32:33] equipment yeah and some of them had a
[00:32:37] fans you know like oh like vation fans
[00:32:41] you know like a computer has a fan MH
[00:32:43] and uh you know one of them was making a
[00:32:46] noise and it wasn't I think it was some
[00:32:49] kind of like F I think so I thought
[00:32:52] maybe I could determine what the the
[00:32:55] frequency like the rotation
[00:32:58] the fan from knowing what not it made
[00:33:01] that's awesome and I think it wor the
[00:33:04] maap worked out I think it had like
[00:33:06] six six um you I was a fan of six uh
[00:33:10] what do you call those things uh uh
[00:33:12] blades six blades there yeah and so you
[00:33:16] I had to divide it by six or multiply by
[00:33:18] six or whatever and I think it it worked
[00:33:19] out that's funny maybe I just made it
[00:33:21] work out yeah yeah did you do you know
[00:33:24] like all the the notes and their number
[00:33:27] frequency in
[00:33:29] hertz I know I only know a okay yeah the
[00:33:33] a that I'm used to is 440 440 yeah so
[00:33:37] well could you figure out relatively
[00:33:41] yeah okay well I mean I have to
[00:33:42] calculated it but I forget what the
[00:33:45] formula is but it's I think it's
[00:33:46] something like
[00:33:48] four * 2 to the n/ 12 or something like
[00:33:52] that and N is the number of half tones
[00:33:55] away from okay okay from that note from
[00:33:58] a okay right I think that's what it is
[00:34:01] but I I don't remember okay so you just
[00:34:02] need to know is you said it was two to
[00:34:05] the n two to the like n over 12 cuz
[00:34:08] there are 12 half steps in a scale okay
[00:34:11] so that's tricky then yeah you can't do
[00:34:14] that in your no no um we had a guest on
[00:34:18] here who can do powers really fast like
[00:34:21] to give him a two-digit number and you
[00:34:22] can he can square it Cube it take it to
[00:34:25] the 12th power and he knows the answer
[00:34:26] immediately oh my God but if it's going
[00:34:28] to be a a fraction I don't know if he
[00:34:30] can do
[00:34:32] that yeah maybe uh we could team up and
[00:34:36] yeah together you walk around together
[00:34:38] be like this is an A and he'd be like
[00:34:41] doing the math until you that would be
[00:34:44] awesome yeah no in in the physics lab we
[00:34:46] did so many things I was telling you
[00:34:48] that like to me those years are were so
[00:34:51] transformative so we studied physics as
[00:34:53] our majors and um it just going to that
[00:34:57] lab you know I had to do some work I I
[00:34:59] was working on this uh this fridge as I
[00:35:02] mentioned but like we would do a lot of
[00:35:04] kind of stupid but looking back actually
[00:35:06] kind of interesting stuff I mean we
[00:35:07] built like little robots autonomous
[00:35:10] robots that's when I learned the Rubik's
[00:35:12] Cube like we had competitions between us
[00:35:15] yeah um we started doing this stupid
[00:35:17] French English language right where we
[00:35:19] would uh try to figure out how to say um
[00:35:23] with French words English phrases
[00:35:27] that makes any sense um it was really
[00:35:30] cool and I remember it just I read so
[00:35:33] many interesting math books and science
[00:35:36] books and just like I think without
[00:35:37] those years I don't know if I'd be where
[00:35:39] I am today I mean it was just like a
[00:35:41] very exploratory time and uh I don't
[00:35:45] know do you feel that same way yeah
[00:35:47] absolutely I mean I think we were all
[00:35:50] very at first just kind of nerds you
[00:35:54] know just interested in science and you
[00:35:56] physics and then we just really got into
[00:35:58] it we got into math and we got into
[00:36:01] physics and and we all had that same
[00:36:04] interest yeah and
[00:36:06] so even though you know even when we
[00:36:08] weren't doing the work we were supposed
[00:36:10] to be doing in the lab we were still
[00:36:12] talking about physics and math right
[00:36:14] right right yeah and more you know
[00:36:15] related things yeah I would I it it bugs
[00:36:18] me sometimes now because I remember back
[00:36:20] then I could probably explain almost
[00:36:23] anything like how it worked how this why
[00:36:26] this is happen happening in the world
[00:36:27] but now it's like I don't even know like
[00:36:31] for example I was in Miami the other day
[00:36:34] and my car we had two cars my mom's car
[00:36:36] was under the Kula saac is that what you
[00:36:39] call it the like the see I probably knew
[00:36:42] what that was called the the awning
[00:36:44] right of our house whatever and then the
[00:36:45] other the other car car was yeah sure I
[00:36:49] think Kack is something else anyways and
[00:36:51] then my car was outside and you know
[00:36:53] Miami is very humid so my car outside
[00:36:57] was like covered in in condensation
[00:37:00] right in the morning whereas her car my
[00:37:02] mom's car was dry but it was still they
[00:37:05] were still in open air but her car was
[00:37:08] just happened to be covered kind of
[00:37:11] protected but it didn't rain right right
[00:37:14] so I I was like I know I I knew I'd be
[00:37:16] able to to to explain this oh yeah
[00:37:18] totally and now I'm like okay so where
[00:37:20] was it warmer why does that matter and
[00:37:23] yeah
[00:37:24] exactly it's a shame I was think like
[00:37:26] when I'm older I'm going to go back and
[00:37:28] and and redo my degree in physics you
[00:37:30] know right right yeah I feel like I knew
[00:37:32] a lot more back then yeah damn anyways
[00:37:37] okay before we go uh I'm going to play a
[00:37:39] couple songs and I just want you to tell
[00:37:40] me like what key it's in sure as fast as
[00:37:44] you can it may not be obvious but here
[00:37:45] we goes the first
[00:37:50] one good time I feel
[00:37:55] aive
[00:37:56] [Music]
[00:37:58] do not
[00:38:01] right it keeps changing a
[00:38:05] [Music]
[00:38:07] okay it really keeps changing I think
[00:38:10] when the when it starts you'll figure it
[00:38:12] out
[00:38:13] [Music]
[00:38:14] okay it's a great song I love this
[00:38:19] [Applause]
[00:38:20] [Music]
[00:38:24] song what do you think
[00:38:29] uh F major okay I I don't know so you
[00:38:32] tell me Oh I thought you were like
[00:38:33] quizzing me no I don't know so I'm
[00:38:37] pretty sure it's F major okay but I
[00:38:39] guess a lot of these rock songs aren't
[00:38:41] very like well they modulate from yeah
[00:38:45] yeah all right let's try something a
[00:38:46] little more uh
[00:38:50] um what do you call it classical
[00:38:55] sure
[00:39:05] all right that's E Yeah e ma yeah that's
[00:39:10] true actually no well now it's changing
[00:39:13] to
[00:39:14] [Music]
[00:39:16] a that's
[00:39:17] a yeah a
[00:39:20] minor but yeah I think I got I gave you
[00:39:23] the piece where you kind of had changed
[00:39:24] a little bit
[00:39:27] that's awesome man all right and then
[00:39:29] one
[00:39:37] more no sorry that was an ad hold on
[00:39:40] yeah like
[00:39:42] well that was a noise what is your
[00:39:45] favorite instrument to
[00:39:48] hear I would
[00:39:51] think uh I can't answer
[00:39:55] that I'm I so many great instruments out
[00:39:58] there I just
[00:40:00] can't I mean like I get into like I I
[00:40:03] start learning a classical guitar a
[00:40:05] couple years ago oh that's right so I
[00:40:07] was really into that so like I thought
[00:40:09] it was the greatest instrument in the
[00:40:13] world you just go from one to the
[00:40:16] other all right this
[00:40:21] song well it
[00:40:25] starts
[00:40:32] trying to think if
[00:40:35] it's yeah it's basically E minor okay
[00:40:38] well so what I mean I'm I'm not as
[00:40:41] knowledgeable in this but like what
[00:40:42] makes a song take hold of a key right
[00:40:45] cuz that song I mean he's just playing a
[00:40:48] riff over and over again probably based
[00:40:50] around E Yeah but does that necessarily
[00:40:54] mean that the song is an e
[00:40:57] no I mean so there different scales the
[00:41:00] two more the most common ones at least
[00:41:03] in uh High scho music or like the major
[00:41:06] key and then the minor key yeah but then
[00:41:09] there are other modes that you can use
[00:41:11] and sometimes songs use like weird modes
[00:41:14] that I'm not used to okay and that's
[00:41:18] definitely one of
[00:41:19] them maybe a little bit but I'm pretty
[00:41:21] sure it was basically E major or E minor
[00:41:24] okay cool man well that was uh that's
[00:41:27] fun to listen to and to talk about um
[00:41:30] I'm sure our listeners will enjoy that
[00:41:32] um as you said great yeah I don't think
[00:41:35] it's a very common skill that you see or
[00:41:38] people I don't think like if they have
[00:41:40] the skill they necessarily get to use it
[00:41:41] or share it so to talk about it I think
[00:41:43] is kind of a cool yeah no I mean
[00:41:45] experience absolutely because yeah it's
[00:41:47] part of me it's part of who I am and uh
[00:41:50] yeah it's great to be able to talk about
[00:41:51] it yeah what do you do now you're a a
[00:41:53] patent lawyer right yeah I'm a patent
[00:41:55] attorney
[00:41:56] from Prodigy Music kid to physicist to
[00:42:02] lawyer exactly well the patn law uses
[00:42:05] like I have to use my physics that's
[00:42:06] true Science Background yeah Science
[00:42:09] Background
[00:42:10] yeah awesome man well thanks for having
[00:42:13] uh thanks for being on the show and uh
[00:42:16] let's hang out soon absolutely best Lu
[00:42:19] to you all right take
[00:42:25] care

=== Nelson Dellis' MIND SHOW - Ben Pridmore // 3x World Memory Champion ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ataKCHHLlc0

[00:00:08] [Music]
[00:00:35] welcome everyone this is Nelson delis us
[00:00:37] memory champ with Ben pmore uh
[00:00:41] three-time US World memory Champion yes
[00:00:45] and uh one of the legends of memory
[00:00:47] Sports and I have the privilege to talk
[00:00:49] to him today and ask him a bunch of
[00:00:51] questions um which I hope he answers and
[00:00:55] uh Ben how you doing I'm doing good
[00:00:58] thanks we've spent the last oh 20
[00:01:00] minutes or so trying to get Skype to
[00:01:02] work this is how technical I am there
[00:01:04] you go I turned off my I turned off my
[00:01:06] internet connection while I was trying
[00:01:07] to plug a lamp in to light the room up a
[00:01:09] bit so okay but we're working now it
[00:01:12] looks very nice very nice setting where
[00:01:15] where are you uh you're in England Darby
[00:01:18] I'm in England yeah belper just outside
[00:01:20] Derby okay is that where you where did
[00:01:22] you grow up I grew up in Boston not the
[00:01:26] American Boston the real Boston the one
[00:01:27] in
[00:01:28] England all the American viewers are
[00:01:30] like what there's a Boston before
[00:01:34] Boston um so what's up what's what's new
[00:01:37] what what what have you been doing today
[00:01:40] what did you do today today I went to
[00:01:42] work which is a horrible thing to have
[00:01:43] to say but oh no I've just started a new
[00:01:46] job which is quite cool I play back with
[00:01:47] numbers all day but it's important to
[00:01:49] have something like that to do so you
[00:01:51] know it pays me money so I can go to
[00:01:53] memory competitions and things that's
[00:01:55] true so your background is in accounting
[00:01:57] is that right that's right yes I'm a
[00:01:59] financial analyst
[00:02:00] okay well I would I would trust you with
[00:02:02] numbers so that's a nice
[00:02:05] thing do you tell people do people that
[00:02:07] your job know what you do unfortunately
[00:02:11] I've just started a new job with people
[00:02:13] who knew all about me they researched me
[00:02:14] they found my videos on the internet and
[00:02:16] everything so I go in there with the
[00:02:18] reputation of being a genius it's
[00:02:20] terrible that's interesting that's
[00:02:22] that's that's not a bad thing um so I
[00:02:26] have so many questions for you I never
[00:02:28] really get the time to sit down with you
[00:02:30] and and chat and hear about um just
[00:02:34] memory Sports from your mind but I
[00:02:36] followed your blog for years and you
[00:02:39] know when I got into the sport in say
[00:02:41] 2009 you were that was your your Prime I
[00:02:45] think right that was pretty much my
[00:02:48] golden age yeah 2008 2009 I was
[00:02:51] completely on top of the world yeah but
[00:02:53] you've been in the sport for when did
[00:02:55] you start uh my first competition was
[00:02:58] 2000 the world Championship that year
[00:03:01] okay and how did you do I came 16th out
[00:03:05] of 20 competitors which was actually
[00:03:07] quite good because I knew nothing about
[00:03:09] memory techniques or anything like that
[00:03:11] when I went along I went to the
[00:03:13] competition basically just cuz I was in
[00:03:15] the area I had a couple of days to spare
[00:03:17] I wanted to see what it was like I
[00:03:19] didn't actually believe there was such a
[00:03:20] thing as memory techniques yeah I'd
[00:03:22] heard people talk about the major system
[00:03:24] and things I assumed it was something
[00:03:25] people had made up to sell books so I
[00:03:28] went in there and repeating to myself
[00:03:30] and assuming that was what everybody
[00:03:32] else did it was only by talking to some
[00:03:34] of the other competitors they started to
[00:03:36] convince me perhaps there is actually
[00:03:37] something in this whole mental
[00:03:39] techniques thing so I sat down and fided
[00:03:41] and I've been addicted ever since that's
[00:03:44] cool and then so that competition in
[00:03:45] 2000 who was the winner was it was it um
[00:03:48] it was Dominic Dominic O'Brien he was
[00:03:51] unquestionably the best in the world
[00:03:53] back in those days Andy Bell came second
[00:03:55] he was the closest Challenger that was
[00:03:57] like maybe the first rival right those
[00:04:00] two guys yeah they they were Arch Rivals
[00:04:02] back since so the mid90s I think when
[00:04:06] Andy first came along in 95 or something
[00:04:09] Dominic of course was the champion right
[00:04:11] from the start in 91 he'd won it
[00:04:13] comfortably by Miles every time Andy won
[00:04:16] one year when Dominic wasn't there but
[00:04:18] otherwise Dominic was pretty much
[00:04:20] Unstoppable okay so Andy won it once
[00:04:22] right just once Andy won it in 98 when
[00:04:25] Dominic wasn't there then he finally got
[00:04:28] his act together in 2002 and he blew
[00:04:30] everyone away and he won that year and
[00:04:32] also the next year after that okay okay
[00:04:35] interesting yeah we had him at the the
[00:04:37] the extreme championships a few years
[00:04:39] ago and I I'd seen a couple videos but
[00:04:42] he to most for the most part seemed like
[00:04:44] an enigma like you know I didn't really
[00:04:46] know much about him but he's a cool guy
[00:04:48] he's a real character back in 2000 when
[00:04:50] I first met him he he was he had long
[00:04:53] hair in a ponytail he was really stylish
[00:04:55] and you know the other competitors were
[00:04:58] all wearing business suits some things
[00:05:00] in those days because it was a very
[00:05:01] Swanky kind of Posh competition Andy of
[00:05:04] course would be wearing jeans and a
[00:05:05] t-shirt he was he was the rock and roll
[00:05:07] World memory Champion that's how he
[00:05:08] described himself very cool and so like
[00:05:12] when you went in there what kind of was
[00:05:14] it the same 10 disciplines I think there
[00:05:16] was poetry as well right there was
[00:05:18] poetry there was no um abstract there
[00:05:20] was no um oh let me think what's the
[00:05:22] word historic dates there were just nine
[00:05:24] disciplines then historic dates came in
[00:05:26] a couple of years later I think and so
[00:05:29] they had ract images too there were no
[00:05:31] abstract images no it was just nine
[00:05:33] disciplines there had been images which
[00:05:36] was photos being projected on a screen
[00:05:37] with an oldfashioned slide projector but
[00:05:39] they couldn't get the technology to work
[00:05:41] apparently so they dropped that a few
[00:05:42] years previously interesting okay and
[00:05:45] then page it really was yeah and then
[00:05:47] the spoken numbers was two digit two
[00:05:50] seconds every digit SP spoken numbers
[00:05:53] was two seconds yeah one every two
[00:05:55] seconds Gunter Gunter Casten did a
[00:05:59] perfect 400 that year in the year 2000
[00:06:02] that's why they had to increase it to
[00:06:03] one every second it become too easy
[00:06:06] that's crazy and then the Poetry how did
[00:06:08] they score that do you remember was it
[00:06:10] one point for every was a very
[00:06:13] complicated scoring system I think it
[00:06:15] was one point for a word plus one point
[00:06:18] for a capital letter and one point for
[00:06:22] some kind of something to do with
[00:06:23] punctuation I think okay that's similar
[00:06:26] I think to the US way you get a point
[00:06:28] for every little nuance and then it's
[00:06:31] per row so if you miss some tiny little
[00:06:33] thing in a row you just get zero for the
[00:06:34] row and you can yeah I think that's how
[00:06:36] it worked okay the problem is that they
[00:06:38] were translating it into different
[00:06:40] languages into German which meant
[00:06:42] that we had situation where something
[00:06:46] that was four points worth in English
[00:06:47] was also translated to Four Points in
[00:06:49] German even though it was one simple
[00:06:51] word so it didn't make any sense and it
[00:06:54] it was unfair plus the Poetry was Tony
[00:06:56] pizan's own poetry which is
[00:06:59] fantastically weird
[00:07:02] and he famous many things but I don't
[00:07:05] think he's ever going to be famous for
[00:07:06] his poetry I would assume that those
[00:07:08] poems were largely about himself
[00:07:12] maybe not really they were um abstract
[00:07:16] and unusual things like the line what
[00:07:20] kind of butterflies grow from trains oh
[00:07:22] jeez okay
[00:07:24] yeah actually the poem in 2000 to give
[00:07:27] him credit was actually rather good it
[00:07:29] was I still remember part of it now it
[00:07:31] was our old clock or something like that
[00:07:33] it was it was a traditional sort of
[00:07:35] English Okay talking about your
[00:07:36] childhood kind of thing about a clock
[00:07:38] and telling time and that kind of thing
[00:07:40] it was it was rather a good poem
[00:07:41] actually okay stuff isn't but that one
[00:07:44] was actually I really like that one and
[00:07:47] I got the top score in the poem that
[00:07:48] year which really really what got me
[00:07:50] hooked to start with yeah just for a few
[00:07:52] years actually I had a reputation as
[00:07:54] being the one who was good at poems good
[00:07:56] at poems competitions then the likes of
[00:07:59] as plel came along and who blew
[00:08:01] everybody away with poetry scars and I
[00:08:03] never quite recovered from that there
[00:08:05] was just that brief time when I was the
[00:08:07] one who was good at poetry and if I
[00:08:08] could learn how to do numbers and cards
[00:08:10] and things I might go on to do something
[00:08:11] good yeah and then so when did you start
[00:08:15] training so I'm guessing after that
[00:08:16] competition you were probably really
[00:08:18] pumped and then started learning some of
[00:08:20] this stuff yeah yeah actually it was the
[00:08:23] night of the first day of the
[00:08:24] competition the world championship was a
[00:08:26] two-day thing in those days after the
[00:08:28] first day of competition I went I bought
[00:08:30] one of Tony Ban's books I learned about
[00:08:32] the major system I drew up a list of
[00:08:34] images for memorizing cards I sat down
[00:08:36] and practiced it that night wow and so
[00:08:38] that was the that was the day I started
[00:08:40] practicing got it so then how did you
[00:08:42] perform in so there was a point where
[00:08:45] you started doing your your Ben system
[00:08:47] stuff right what what year was that that
[00:08:50] was 2003 okay okay so pretty soon after
[00:08:54] yeah it's early in 2003 I sat down and
[00:08:58] worked out it started out just being a
[00:09:00] thousand digigit system as opposed to
[00:09:02] the hundred that I used to do and then I
[00:09:04] decided I'd expand it a bit I'd bring in
[00:09:07] an image for every two cards and for
[00:09:09] every 10 binary digits as well and make
[00:09:11] some kind of Master System it was sort
[00:09:12] of a strange moment of inspiration that
[00:09:14] I got there and I sat down and worked on
[00:09:16] that for about six months and did I'm
[00:09:19] always curious I mean because now you
[00:09:21] know there's the two the two card system
[00:09:23] and and three-digit system for numbers
[00:09:25] is pretty standard um back then though
[00:09:29] was anybody talking about it was anybody
[00:09:31] trying it and failing did anyone have a
[00:09:34] system like that at all I don't recall
[00:09:36] anyone ever mentioning the possibility
[00:09:38] of a two card system until I decided to
[00:09:40] do it I'm sure somebody had had the idea
[00:09:43] before I'd never heard anyone try it
[00:09:45] before I I was sort I was it was it was
[00:09:48] new it was exciting I know nowadays
[00:09:50] people take it for granted everybody
[00:09:52] does it but back then when I said I was
[00:09:54] having an image for every two cards
[00:09:55] everyone was some Blown Away by even the
[00:09:58] possibility of it I mean that must be a
[00:10:00] cool thing for you to feel like you
[00:10:03] created an you had an idea that nobody
[00:10:06] in the world in the entire world had
[00:10:08] thought about right and it is quite cool
[00:10:11] yes I
[00:10:12] mean looking at it in perspective I'm
[00:10:14] just sort of a step along the way to the
[00:10:16] wonderful things that people are doing
[00:10:17] memory nowadays but it was really it was
[00:10:20] good to be sort of that step to be a
[00:10:23] Pioneer in that kind of way I liked it
[00:10:25] yeah I mean I used to complain at first
[00:10:27] when people started calling it The Ben
[00:10:28] system I said that's a stupid name I
[00:10:31] hate it don't do that but then people
[00:10:32] stopped saying it and I realized I
[00:10:34] actually did quite like it so ever since
[00:10:36] then I've encouraged people to say the
[00:10:37] Ben system yeah no I mean I've I've
[00:10:40] spent so many hours sitting down
[00:10:42] convincing myself that I'm going to come
[00:10:44] up with the next Ben system something
[00:10:46] that nobody's thought of before but it's
[00:10:49] it's tough man and I have nothing to
[00:10:51] show for it so I think that's really
[00:10:53] cool it's like a cool thing to to
[00:10:57] own it gets tough and tougher as people
[00:11:00] get better and better yeah you have to
[00:11:02] really go mad with systems nowadays to
[00:11:04] do something new and exciting I know
[00:11:06] what are your thoughts on on the this
[00:11:08] Shadow system that um Alex and Lance and
[00:11:12] yanas kind of use I'll be brutally
[00:11:14] honest with you I don't understand it
[00:11:16] I've tried to understand what Lance is
[00:11:18] talking about when he goes on about his
[00:11:20] shadow system I've read the things he's
[00:11:21] posted on the internet at Len I still
[00:11:23] can't quite get it to click in my mind
[00:11:25] what on Earth I going on about yeah the
[00:11:27] Lan's explanation is a bit tricky but
[00:11:30] Alex explains it pretty well I mean the
[00:11:31] idea is just using variable images per
[00:11:34] location so it it changes a
[00:11:37] lot it's an interesting idea I I mean if
[00:11:40] it works for you do it that's what I've
[00:11:42] always said to people the thing about
[00:11:43] memory techniques as I've said over and
[00:11:45] over again in the last 15 years it's
[00:11:47] different people's brains work
[00:11:49] differently you know if you can come up
[00:11:50] with something that's good for you then
[00:11:52] that's great but that doesn't
[00:11:53] necessarily mean anybody else is going
[00:11:55] to ever be able to do it right yeah that
[00:11:58] that's exactly it and even even if you
[00:12:00] you may be doing something simpler than
[00:12:02] what's out there and it may be the thing
[00:12:04] that sets you a world record it's it's
[00:12:06] really what is your comfort and what you
[00:12:08] practice the most you know yeah
[00:12:09] absolutely there's people out there who
[00:12:11] still use very simple systems and do
[00:12:13] amazing things with them yeah yeah
[00:12:15] because the thing is with these larger
[00:12:17] systems right you have to spend more
[00:12:18] time learning them and and be because
[00:12:21] they need to be natural it can't be like
[00:12:23] you're trying to figure out what this
[00:12:24] represents it needs to be instant the
[00:12:26] exactly Yeah the more there are the
[00:12:28] harder that is to get it instant right
[00:12:31] yeah it's just it's practice you know
[00:12:33] there there's still nobody found a way
[00:12:34] around sitting down and practicing no
[00:12:36] nobody's going to win the World
[00:12:37] Championship without sitting and I do
[00:12:39] get asked questions quite a lot still by
[00:12:41] beginners they they think I've got some
[00:12:43] secret method I can teach it to them and
[00:12:45] snap just like that they can memorize a
[00:12:47] 5,000 digigit number without any effort
[00:12:50] unfortunately no it takes work yeah
[00:12:53] that's true so I I mean I I'm fascinated
[00:12:56] by the history stuff and you've been
[00:12:57] around long enough to know all these
[00:12:59] stories I hope you don't mind talking
[00:13:00] about it um I always love to talk about
[00:13:03] history I am the old man of memory
[00:13:04] competitions nowadays so when if we get
[00:13:06] together in a pub after a competition or
[00:13:09] you know in a cafe during lunch break I
[00:13:11] always go on and on about the olden days
[00:13:12] of memory competitions I think that's my
[00:13:14] role in these things nowadays yeah you
[00:13:16] should you should consider writing a
[00:13:17] book about just the history of the sport
[00:13:20] have you thought about that to be honest
[00:13:22] I've got to stop saying to be brutally
[00:13:24] honest that's like one of my stock
[00:13:25] phrases I say it even when it doesn't
[00:13:26] mean anything it sounds good in America
[00:13:28] we never hear
[00:13:29] again I've just realized I'm saying it
[00:13:32] anyway as I was about to say a few years
[00:13:35] ago I decided to sit down and write a
[00:13:36] book it was going to be called Naughty
[00:13:38] memories as in n o u g HT y a complete
[00:13:41] history of memory competition in the
[00:13:43] 2000s in the naughties but I never got
[00:13:45] really past the first chapter one day
[00:13:48] I'll sit down and finish it maybe but
[00:13:50] that was a golden age of memory
[00:13:51] competitions and it needs a proper book
[00:13:53] about it I agree yeah I would read that
[00:13:55] I would buy that um so what else so then
[00:13:58] after so then you started working on the
[00:14:00] system the Ben system in 2003 but did
[00:14:04] you use it immediately and did you see a
[00:14:06] dip in your score or did you wait a
[00:14:07] little bit and then yeah I started using
[00:14:09] it immediately I didn't want to carry on
[00:14:11] using the old system at the same time as
[00:14:13] I was working on the new one I just
[00:14:15] wanted to get get the new one in my head
[00:14:17] as quickly as possible and yeah my
[00:14:18] scores especially in things like speed
[00:14:20] cards went downhill fast and you know it
[00:14:23] gradually picked back up again once I
[00:14:25] got more familiar with the images with
[00:14:26] the system got it it actually quite a
[00:14:29] long time before speed cards I was able
[00:14:31] to get back to the level I was before
[00:14:33] yeah using the new system with the
[00:14:35] longer ones it worked a lot better with
[00:14:37] the hour long disciplines which I
[00:14:39] practiced a lot in those days I was 10
[00:14:42] 10 years ago 10 12 years ago I was mad
[00:14:44] at practicing I spending every waking
[00:14:46] hour practicing I never quite got back
[00:14:48] to that level after I won the World
[00:14:50] Championship the first time in 2004 but
[00:14:52] before that I was really dedicated to
[00:14:55] getting things clicking in my head it's
[00:14:57] tough when you win I haven't to me too
[00:14:59] like it's hard to keep that going you
[00:15:01] can maybe do it a couple more years but
[00:15:03] then it's never the same yeah I think it
[00:15:05] happens to everybody I mean after I won
[00:15:07] in 2004 my motivation went flat
[00:15:09] completely I sort of struggled my way
[00:15:11] back eventually it took me a couple of
[00:15:13] years I got back up to the top levels
[00:15:15] just because I was still finding it
[00:15:16] exciting but since really 2008 I won a
[00:15:20] again the next year 2009 but I was
[00:15:22] basically coasting on the work I'd done
[00:15:24] previously I hadn't improved at all I
[00:15:26] was lucky to get through and win again
[00:15:28] and since then I've just never been able
[00:15:29] to sit down with the dedication I have
[00:15:31] and get back into it which is quite sad
[00:15:34] but it's still fun to watch the amazing
[00:15:36] things other people are doing so wildly
[00:15:38] surpassing anything I ever achieved in
[00:15:40] the past but is let me talk about that
[00:15:42] for a second because I'm experiencing a
[00:15:44] similar thing like really badly it's
[00:15:47] hard it's it's hard to accept the fact
[00:15:50] that you used to be able to sit down and
[00:15:52] motivate yourself um and here you are
[00:15:56] you know you and I were wiser we're
[00:15:58] older we have championships under our
[00:16:00] belt you think we know that we can do it
[00:16:03] we've done it but there's just something
[00:16:05] you can't I I don't know what it is it's
[00:16:07] exactly if I could pinpoint it you know
[00:16:10] that could be a great breakthrough and I
[00:16:11] could do something about it all I can
[00:16:13] say is that you know it affects
[00:16:14] everybody Dominic O'Brien said to me you
[00:16:17] know he he just can't motivate himself
[00:16:19] to sit down and work on these things
[00:16:21] anymore I'm sure it's the same for
[00:16:23] everybody else who's won the World
[00:16:24] Championship or the US Championship or
[00:16:26] anything in the past it gets to you in
[00:16:28] the end yeah yeah yeah um so then after
[00:16:31] you started using the and seeing good
[00:16:33] results from your system was was it you
[00:16:35] and Andy were you guys the two then
[00:16:38] because I guess Dominic had bowed out a
[00:16:40] little bit Dominic had bowed out a
[00:16:42] little bit Yeah it I mean when Andy won
[00:16:45] it so spectacularly in 2002 I think
[00:16:48] everybody said oh Dominic's had it he's
[00:16:50] passed his best 2003 the world
[00:16:53] championship that year it was in
[00:16:54] Malaysia it was in November I think it
[00:16:56] was it's still one of my absolute all
[00:16:59] time favorite memory competitions I Lov
[00:17:01] it is that the one that there's a a
[00:17:03] documentary about from thec no I don't
[00:17:06] think they made a documentary that year
[00:17:08] okay I'm thinking about the one with Ed
[00:17:09] cook running in the mountains no that
[00:17:12] was later that was 2007 I see
[00:17:14] 2003 there was Dominic and Andy there
[00:17:17] was Gunter who was always close there
[00:17:20] there was Dr Yip from Malaysia Yip Sweet
[00:17:22] Tree he was a he was one of the big
[00:17:24] names in those days that was the
[00:17:25] dictionary guy right he could that's the
[00:17:27] one yeah he memorized the Oxford English
[00:17:29] dictionary he actually didn't come to
[00:17:31] the world championship that year which
[00:17:32] is strange because it was basically in
[00:17:34] his hometown but he always said he only
[00:17:36] came to these competitions because he
[00:17:38] brought his little students along he'd
[00:17:39] have sort of hordes of young Malaysians
[00:17:41] following after him so he said felt he
[00:17:44] didn't need to come to this one but he
[00:17:45] always did so well but there was also
[00:17:48] Yan foran who was Danish German he was a
[00:17:51] great guy he was a lot of fun to hang
[00:17:53] out with he's a comedian in his real
[00:17:55] life so he was always a you know life
[00:17:57] and soul of the party and there was the
[00:17:59] newcomers there was me and there was
[00:18:01] Asel okay from Austria so there were the
[00:18:04] six of us so we're all fighting it out
[00:18:06] all the way through this competition
[00:18:08] Andy won it in the end ASD came second I
[00:18:10] came third but the whole epic struggle
[00:18:14] between it yeah it was it was like the
[00:18:16] beginning of a new era of competition I
[00:18:19] can imagine yeah and was Ed cook there
[00:18:21] yet or not not yet no Ed Ed had competed
[00:18:24] for the first time in 2003 at the uh
[00:18:26] mind Sports Olympiad competition got it
[00:18:29] and actually he did come to the world
[00:18:30] championship I'm I'm I was wrong there
[00:18:32] yeah he Ed was there that year yeah he
[00:18:34] was just beginning got it and then so
[00:18:37] when did you finally win was it 06 I won
[00:18:40] the next year4 four okay
[00:18:43] nice single-handedly or was it like
[00:18:47] close no I I I won by absolute miles in
[00:18:50] 2004 it's uh gun was gun hadn't been
[00:18:54] training he was he was well off form
[00:18:56] back that year I think he came ninth in
[00:18:57] the end he was a long way off the pace
[00:18:59] it was me against ASD basically Andy
[00:19:01] sort of had been going off on his own
[00:19:04] organizing his own competitions falling
[00:19:06] out with the organizers and he turned up
[00:19:08] to the world championship after all but
[00:19:10] he hadn't been training at all so he
[00:19:11] wasn't really in the running either it
[00:19:13] was basically me against asid and I won
[00:19:16] it pretty clearly by a fair distance in
[00:19:18] the end nice and so the actually I
[00:19:20] remember Andy talking about that with me
[00:19:22] when he came to the xmt that he tried to
[00:19:24] do a competition similar in in the sense
[00:19:27] that it was like different than the
[00:19:29] World Championships yeah were you there
[00:19:31] did you go to it I went to it yes okay
[00:19:34] the M World Cup it was in Germany um and
[00:19:38] what was the the Prem like how did it
[00:19:39] work do you
[00:19:42] remember I think you broke up a bit
[00:19:44] there what were you asking oh just how
[00:19:46] did it go like what was the how did it
[00:19:48] work it was it was um the idea about it
[00:19:53] was that it would all be numbers and
[00:19:54] cards there wouldn't be anything like
[00:19:56] words or names and faces and things it
[00:19:58] would all be the kind of things that you
[00:19:59] do with memory systems there were longer
[00:20:02] recall times so that you weren't sort of
[00:20:04] struggling to recall in a fixed time you
[00:20:07] basically had as long as you could
[00:20:08] possibly need and so it it was all about
[00:20:11] that and there he was going to do if
[00:20:14] he'd gone on and done more competitions
[00:20:16] there would been speed things like 50
[00:20:18] digits as quickly as possible cool on a
[00:20:20] computer I think the plan was but uh he
[00:20:23] never got that far but the competition
[00:20:25] itself there were only about half a
[00:20:26] dozen of us took part in it maybe more I
[00:20:29] think it was about 10 in fact but it was
[00:20:32] it was exciting it was a lot of fun it
[00:20:34] was it was me against Jan fman we were
[00:20:36] the the end main competitors and I won
[00:20:38] it in the end oh nice okay cool and then
[00:20:43] so I want to see this memory of yours in
[00:20:47] 2009 when you went to the United States
[00:20:50] do you remember that I think so yes so
[00:20:54] that's when I first met you do you
[00:20:56] remember that or no
[00:20:58] honest I'm saying it
[00:21:01] again no I don't I don't actually
[00:21:03] remember that it's funny you sent me a
[00:21:05] Facebook message saying to arrange this
[00:21:08] interview and I noticed that the first
[00:21:09] thing you sent me was in 2009 saying
[00:21:12] hello I met you at the world me at the
[00:21:14] US memory championships oh man I gotta
[00:21:17] look at that about rud gam the uh mental
[00:21:20] calculation guy yeah I can't see that I
[00:21:22] ever replied I'm sure I must have done
[00:21:24] but there's no reply on Facebook perhaps
[00:21:26] I sent you an email or something or
[00:21:27] perhaps I forgot about it I do that
[00:21:29] that's so funny that's cool yeah I don't
[00:21:32] actually remember the competition at all
[00:21:33] in 2009 I know I went to the US
[00:21:35] championships two maybe three times
[00:21:37] because I like to just go along and
[00:21:39] watch it I was certainly there in uh the
[00:21:41] Year Josh fur won it was that
[00:21:44] 2006 seven six six I think six maybe
[00:21:48] even five I think he was there in 2005
[00:21:51] yeah that's right was there and then he
[00:21:53] won was there that time as well yeah
[00:21:56] nice but yeah I mean I remember a whole
[00:21:59] lot either but I do remember after the
[00:22:01] competition I wanted to speak to you we
[00:22:03] sat down I think it was me Brad zpp and
[00:22:06] maybe a third guy and you were sitting
[00:22:08] in a chair across from us and I was like
[00:22:10] show me how you do the cards and you
[00:22:11] literally picked up a deck and went
[00:22:14] through six or 12 cards and put it down
[00:22:18] and you just started saying like Ace of
[00:22:19] Diamonds two of Hearts whatever and I
[00:22:21] remember that moment I walked from that
[00:22:24] Union Square in in kind of downtown New
[00:22:27] York I walked to my friends where I was
[00:22:29] staying which was in Upper East Side I
[00:22:31] walked maybe
[00:22:33] almost uh 80 Blocks just talking to my
[00:22:36] friends on the phone like I met this guy
[00:22:39] you know I I didn't do too well in the
[00:22:40] competition but I remember that moment
[00:22:42] just being the moment where I was hooked
[00:22:44] to this thing and I I oh that's amazing
[00:22:46] yeah so thanks thanks for remembering
[00:22:51] it um so let's let's talk about what's
[00:22:55] next I mean you're working I know you're
[00:22:57] probably one of the few or the only
[00:23:01] memory person who gets the coolest
[00:23:04] projects uh like people com and approach
[00:23:06] you you did a music video for DJ Shadow
[00:23:09] which is my favorite you did something
[00:23:11] cool with the the bilbow mus Museum yeah
[00:23:15] yep what else
[00:23:17] um I I get strange offers like this just
[00:23:21] every now and then I I think those two
[00:23:23] you've just mentioned are actually the
[00:23:24] coolest ones I've ever done the music
[00:23:26] video and the uh ghim Museum and Bill
[00:23:28] Bell yeah just cuz they had you know
[00:23:31] puppets and animations and things going
[00:23:33] on in the background I think I think
[00:23:35] it's has to do with just you have such a
[00:23:38] you're just a character overall in ter
[00:23:40] your accent is interesting your your
[00:23:43] your background is interesting you're
[00:23:44] into comics and cartoons your images are
[00:23:46] funny um yeah they must be super drawn
[00:23:50] to
[00:23:51] that I guess so but uh actually I think
[00:23:54] my voice is horrible this is why I hate
[00:23:56] doing you know phone interview views and
[00:23:58] things cu the only thing you can hear is
[00:24:00] my Dreadful voice americ always like it
[00:24:03] they think oh wow G whiz he's got an
[00:24:06] accent exactly
[00:24:08] yeah um so wait I'd love to know more
[00:24:11] about the DJ Shadow thing I think we've
[00:24:13] talked about it a little bit but I'm a
[00:24:14] huge fan of DJ Shadow and um freck
[00:24:17] what's her name uh little
[00:24:19] dragon um so they filmed that how many
[00:24:22] takes did it
[00:24:24] take I honestly lost count they did a
[00:24:27] lot of takes cuz obviously the thing was
[00:24:28] one single continuous T all continuous
[00:24:31] yeah it was wonderful but it took a lot
[00:24:33] of tries and the problem first of all
[00:24:36] was the mechanical hummingbird that
[00:24:37] started off it was meant to fly by
[00:24:39] itself you it starts with a guy holding
[00:24:41] it and fly fizzing it around it's meant
[00:24:43] to be a remote control thing that would
[00:24:45] they would flight around in a circle and
[00:24:46] then into the snake's mouth they spent
[00:24:48] basically all morning trying to get it
[00:24:50] and it just wouldn't work so they gave
[00:24:52] upon that in the end and then after that
[00:24:54] they did maybe a dozen takes over the
[00:24:57] course of a day I was spending the whole
[00:24:59] thing squatting down inside this
[00:25:00] cardboard case yeah I didn't get to see
[00:25:03] any of the exciting things that were
[00:25:05] happening so for those who don't know
[00:25:07] the the Ben did a music video for um
[00:25:11] basically he's memorized a deck of cards
[00:25:13] and the music video is a live
[00:25:15] reenactment of what he's visualizing so
[00:25:17] there's a big hummingbird and it's in
[00:25:20] all these different rooms and it goes
[00:25:21] into a snake playing a boomerang uh a
[00:25:24] what do you call it a Tamp tambourine
[00:25:27] etc etc it's it's really cool and um at
[00:25:30] the end Ben jumps out of a cake and kind
[00:25:32] of recites the whole
[00:25:36] story it's funny after all of these
[00:25:38] takes they used one of the earliest ones
[00:25:40] in the final production oh yeah yeah I
[00:25:42] think they like that best because the
[00:25:44] cake just collapses slightly right at
[00:25:45] the end that's a funny part it was a
[00:25:48] perfect ending the video is just
[00:25:50] Sensational I loved it so much it's good
[00:25:53] I I will watch it just for fun every you
[00:25:55] know few months or something just cuz
[00:25:57] it's a it's it's a good song and it's a
[00:25:59] good video and it is also a perfect
[00:26:01] illustration of what really does happen
[00:26:03] in Our Minds when we're doing these
[00:26:05] things we try to explain it but that is
[00:26:06] the only time people have really been
[00:26:08] able to put it into a visual form that
[00:26:10] they can show was yeah now did you ever
[00:26:13] meet any of the artists no I didn't I
[00:26:16] just met the directors they DJ Shadow
[00:26:18] sent a guy along from America someone
[00:26:20] from his production team or something
[00:26:22] like that but he wasn't there himself
[00:26:24] and neither were little dragon and who
[00:26:27] was the person who's idea was it I mean
[00:26:29] did DJ Shadow know about this and he was
[00:26:31] like we got to get Ben no it was the two
[00:26:34] directors um you and Jones moris and
[00:26:36] Casey Redmond they came up with the idea
[00:26:38] I don't know how they'd heard about me
[00:26:39] they they'd sort of stumbled across it
[00:26:41] on the internet somewhere and decided
[00:26:42] they it would make a great music video
[00:26:45] and then they basically hked the idea
[00:26:46] around all the artists they could find
[00:26:48] in the world and for some reason DJ
[00:26:50] Shadow said yeah okay let's do it
[00:26:52] interesting and then the deck of cards
[00:26:55] you actually memorize or the the image
[00:26:57] is did did you decide on those or was it
[00:27:01] an actual Shuffle deck of cards actual
[00:27:03] random shuffle deck okay we did four
[00:27:06] decks I think on the day okay we refed
[00:27:08] the memorizing bit a week and a half
[00:27:11] earlier and I went through and described
[00:27:13] the images and they picked the one they
[00:27:15] like best and they had I think it was
[00:27:17] literally 10 days to go through and
[00:27:19] arrange costumes and props and
[00:27:21] everything yeah and are all the images
[00:27:24] accurate to you or are they somewhat
[00:27:27] made more generic and L I changed a lot
[00:27:29] of them I mean a lot of them were like
[00:27:32] copyrighted characters fiction the
[00:27:34] street fighter yeah I just simplifies
[00:27:37] things a bit you know yeah yeah but it
[00:27:40] it still came out very close in in the
[00:27:43] video to what actually happens in my
[00:27:45] mind got it and where did they film that
[00:27:48] was that like an abandoned
[00:27:50] Mall yeah it was an abandoned clothes
[00:27:53] shop I think in a shopping center in
[00:27:56] Wales we around the the old store rooms
[00:27:59] and there it's there's escalators
[00:28:02] there's yeah colored lights and things
[00:28:04] it all looked very good yeah I love it
[00:28:06] it's good that's cool so so then what's
[00:28:09] what's up with you now what where what's
[00:28:11] your plan right so you're working you
[00:28:14] didn't you didn't make it to the the
[00:28:16] championship last uh I could come to the
[00:28:18] world championship last year I just
[00:28:20] haven't got any money I still
[00:28:22] haven't it's so far I know it's such a
[00:28:24] lot of it's a lot of money these days to
[00:28:26] get out there it is but But I me I can't
[00:28:28] complain I've just come back from a week
[00:28:30] and a half in China paid for a buy a TV
[00:28:32] show oh that's right the brain the Super
[00:28:34] Brain yeah the brain not only did I have
[00:28:37] the week in Nan Jing um filming this
[00:28:39] thing the brain they also paid for me to
[00:28:40] go up to visit my brother in Harbin in
[00:28:43] Northeast China for three days as well
[00:28:45] how cool that's which was awesome and
[00:28:47] you know but I'm still waiting for them
[00:28:49] to pay me the fee for that show because
[00:28:52] that I'm sort of flat broke at the
[00:28:53] moment but when I get that I'll be in
[00:28:55] one of my rare phases where I've got
[00:28:56] just a little bit of money so you know
[00:28:59] I'll put a bit of that aside I'll make
[00:29:00] my way to the extreme memory tournament
[00:29:02] this year there you go yeah so you're
[00:29:04] play memoriad in November in Las Vegas
[00:29:07] yeah I'm excited Las Vegas it's my
[00:29:09] favorite place to go on holiday I've not
[00:29:11] been there for a good few years now and
[00:29:12] I can't wait to go there again for a
[00:29:14] memory competition yet right in in under
[00:29:17] the context of a memory competition
[00:29:19] Vegas doesn't get any cooler you know
[00:29:22] that's right um so you are planning to
[00:29:26] be at the xmt
[00:29:28] provided you qualify which I think you
[00:29:30] will I don't know I we're we're four
[00:29:34] weeks out of five into the qualification
[00:29:36] at the moment I did unexpectedly badly
[00:29:39] in images and then unexpectedly badly in
[00:29:41] numbers as well I'm in 12th Place I
[00:29:44] really need to get a solid words
[00:29:46] performance just to scrape onto the wire
[00:29:48] here so fingers crossed yeah I don't
[00:29:51] qualify I think I might come along and
[00:29:53] watch the xmt anyway but I'd much rather
[00:29:56] be there as a competitor yeah yeah yeah
[00:29:58] we'd love to have you again um and then
[00:30:01] so then the memoriad and then hopefully
[00:30:04] are you g to try to go to the uh the
[00:30:05] World Championships I think it's in
[00:30:07] Singapore yeah it's planned for
[00:30:09] Singapore at the moment but frankly I
[00:30:11] don't think they've ever managed to
[00:30:12] settle a proper location for it before
[00:30:15] May at the earliest so we'll just have
[00:30:17] to see where it turns out to be but one
[00:30:19] way or another I'd like to go along yeah
[00:30:21] yeah I'm I'm not in training for it
[00:30:23] unfortunately I haven't been for a long
[00:30:25] long time but okay it's really when it
[00:30:28] comes to World Championships nowadays
[00:30:29] it's about going along having fun
[00:30:31] memorizing what I can still remember how
[00:30:33] to memorize and just hanging out with
[00:30:35] all of the competitors yeah that's the
[00:30:36] best part honestly there's so many
[00:30:38] interesting people and it's nice to see
[00:30:40] those same faces every year you know
[00:30:42] yeah and this whole new generations
[00:30:44] coming along now there's new I've not
[00:30:45] been to that many memory competition
[00:30:47] just lately I'm feeling a bit out of
[00:30:48] touch with all the new Young bugs coming
[00:30:51] along with it yeah yeah yeah but it's
[00:30:53] funny that the competitions in Singapore
[00:30:55] I got on the bus to go back to the
[00:30:58] airport and Tony buzan came on board and
[00:31:01] all the Chinese people there were like
[00:31:02] worshiping him and I said Tony do we
[00:31:05] know where the competition is next year
[00:31:07] and he was he looked at me like he was
[00:31:09] like in his in his way that he does and
[00:31:12] he said where else would it be like he
[00:31:15] was offended that I asked and I was like
[00:31:16] oh so it's in China again he's like of
[00:31:18] course and then he left you know he
[00:31:22] flipped his scarf or whatever and left
[00:31:24] and then and then he that in Singapore
[00:31:26] so I don't know he always says that yeah
[00:31:30] yeah every year at the world memory
[00:31:31] championships ever since I've been going
[00:31:33] to them they've always said it'll be
[00:31:34] same place next year yeah
[00:31:37] true that's funny um so let's I want to
[00:31:42] talk about the the super brain or the
[00:31:44] brain show how was that again who was
[00:31:46] there was Jame patter James Patterson
[00:31:48] there again James Patterson was there
[00:31:50] but he wasn't one of the British team he
[00:31:51] had one of he brought one of his
[00:31:53] students a young boy called um Henry
[00:31:56] okay I had to struggle and think of the
[00:31:58] name there his dad's called Mark the
[00:32:00] boy's called Henry I think I would think
[00:32:02] you of Mark Henry the big weightlifting
[00:32:04] wrestler yeah yeah yeah ICI to remember
[00:32:07] which one's Mark and which one's Henry
[00:32:08] but yeah young boy called Henry and we
[00:32:10] also had Marlo Knight who's like top Bri
[00:32:13] competitor at the moment and Robert
[00:32:15] Fountain who's one of the top British
[00:32:17] mental calculators he was there in last
[00:32:19] year as well and what was your task this
[00:32:21] year can you tell me or my task this
[00:32:23] year was really cool it was diffusing
[00:32:25] bombs we had that's cool
[00:32:28] 100 explosive devices marked with four
[00:32:31] different colored tapes and half of them
[00:32:33] you have to cut the blue wire to diffuse
[00:32:35] it half of them you have to cut the red
[00:32:36] wire oh no so we had to memorize which
[00:32:38] ones were which and then they laid them
[00:32:40] all out in a random sequence and my
[00:32:42] opponent started at one end I started at
[00:32:44] the other we had to race along the line
[00:32:46] cutting wires that's met in the middle
[00:32:48] and whoever got the most right was the
[00:32:50] winner that's cool I that's kind of like
[00:32:52] a binary task then yeah uh it's more of
[00:32:55] a uh just a basic number thing really
[00:32:59] there were 10 different colors of tapes
[00:33:00] so it
[00:33:01] was got it was me just memorizing 100
[00:33:05] different numbers you know of just 50
[00:33:07] actually because you just had to
[00:33:08] remember the blue ones and know that any
[00:33:10] one you didn't recognize was red say
[00:33:12] yeah okay and then did you win I lost I
[00:33:17] know you
[00:33:20] exploded blown up yes got it it's a it's
[00:33:23] a shame because we did two trial runs of
[00:33:25] it beforehand and I won both the trials
[00:33:27] in the rehear but he beat me on the
[00:33:28] night when it
[00:33:30] counted that's good yeah that's that's
[00:33:33] what happened to me I had five trials
[00:33:35] and I had to memorize that maze thing
[00:33:37] and then finally the last one you know I
[00:33:40] won I think three out of the five and
[00:33:41] then we did the real one on the show and
[00:33:43] I
[00:33:44] lost hey these things happen as I was I
[00:33:46] kept saying to everybody there I didn't
[00:33:48] actually care whether we win or not
[00:33:50] we're just going there to have fun and
[00:33:52] compete but the Chinese TV people saying
[00:33:54] no no you have to be fierce you have to
[00:33:56] be go team Britain we will push our
[00:33:58] Chinese enemies yeah so we did all that
[00:34:01] for the Camas but it was all about just
[00:34:03] having fun my opponent um young Chinese
[00:34:06] man called um suching Bo or something
[00:34:09] very similar to that but he was all the
[00:34:12] time saying I can't believe I'm meeting
[00:34:13] Ben fitmore the great
[00:34:15] Legend and of course he beat me hands
[00:34:18] down in the end so just go show never
[00:34:20] meet your Legends that's funny yeah do
[00:34:23] you um so I forgot what I was going to
[00:34:26] say um
[00:34:28] I guess before that the touching on what
[00:34:31] I said at the beginning like in terms of
[00:34:33] like how that person reacted to you you
[00:34:36] have this thing about you I don't know
[00:34:38] what it is I guess it's because you've
[00:34:39] been around so long or but I don't know
[00:34:42] Dominic's been in that way and I don't
[00:34:44] think he gets the same Fanfare as you do
[00:34:46] like you're known kind of by anybody who
[00:34:48] gets into the sport and it's it's a
[00:34:51] weird thing but it it must you must love
[00:34:53] it right it's great I H yeah it's good I
[00:34:57] I blame the personally it could be the
[00:34:58] Hat that's right it's because I'm the
[00:35:00] one with the hat that's how I became
[00:35:02] well known at the started memory
[00:35:03] competitions it's it's a sort of
[00:35:05] distinctive icon that's true that people
[00:35:07] can fixate on if if like me you can't
[00:35:09] remember people's faces you can always
[00:35:11] remember the hat and so that's how I
[00:35:12] become so memorable and your t-shirts
[00:35:15] right and the t-shirts yes I'm wearing
[00:35:17] obviously an extreme memory tournament
[00:35:19] t-shirt tonight but as I think you said
[00:35:22] in your blog brilliantly who else is
[00:35:24] going to go along to the competition
[00:35:25] wearing t-shirts saying things like I'm
[00:35:27] you Jaan I am from space I see that my
[00:35:31] t-shirts are much looked forward to by
[00:35:33] people yeah yeah my um on there's a
[00:35:36] documentary a friend did about my thing
[00:35:38] and you it was mostly covering 2012
[00:35:41] World Championships and every time they
[00:35:43] show this just a a shot of you wearing
[00:35:45] the I'm big in Japan or like um what's
[00:35:49] the other one
[00:35:51] the what do you have you have I'm big in
[00:35:53] Japan or was there I need I am from
[00:35:55] space I'm from space that's the one yeah
[00:35:58] everybody would laugh it was it was
[00:35:59] really
[00:36:01] good um quickly what's compared to
[00:36:03] Sheldon Cooper which I think is very
[00:36:05] flattering but he has a great range of
[00:36:07] t-shirts as well that's from The Big
[00:36:09] Bang Theory yeah Big Bang Theory yes
[00:36:10] yeah yeah uh what's your all-time
[00:36:14] favorite memory Championship
[00:36:19] memory oh gosh there's so much to choose
[00:36:21] from as I said World Championship 2003
[00:36:24] was a great one 2007 2008 were also
[00:36:28] fantastic those were the two years it
[00:36:30] was in um Bahrain I think it was okay we
[00:36:33] had a lot of fun at those ones that's
[00:36:35] the 2010 World Championship in China was
[00:36:37] also a great time for all of us that was
[00:36:41] there's been so many competitions it's
[00:36:43] hard to yeah you've been how many how
[00:36:45] many have you done would you say sorry
[00:36:48] how many have you competed in would you
[00:36:49] say I have no
[00:36:52] idea I don't keep count of I never know
[00:36:54] these the person you have to ask is bis
[00:36:56] Conrad yeah yeah he knows because he
[00:36:59] always knows these things and whenever
[00:37:00] at a competition someone comes up to me
[00:37:02] and says um what's the standard for this
[00:37:05] or what's the world record for this or
[00:37:06] what happened in I say I don't know go
[00:37:08] and ask bis he always knows these things
[00:37:10] so yeah yeah but I think I've competed
[00:37:13] in more memory competitions than anyone
[00:37:15] except Boris that's the record I have
[00:37:17] now but I don't remember the one number
[00:37:19] it is we'll find it out I'll look on the
[00:37:22] stats page um couple more questions and
[00:37:26] I'll let you go this one one do you have
[00:37:29] any ideas for getting faster at speed
[00:37:35] cards
[00:37:37] well personally you don't have to share
[00:37:39] them I'm just where curious if you have
[00:37:41] an idea and you maybe want to play with
[00:37:43] it I wish I did um really all I can do
[00:37:47] is I know if I get properly in practice
[00:37:49] if I'm doing speed cards on a regular
[00:37:51] basis I'm around the 22nd kind of Mark
[00:37:54] and that's as fast as I think I can get
[00:37:56] but you know well my only idea when it
[00:37:59] comes to these things nowadays is to
[00:38:01] keep practicing keep getting a little
[00:38:02] bit better I know a lot of people are
[00:38:04] get becoming stupendously Fast Very
[00:38:07] quickly yeah do you it's funny I always
[00:38:10] say that once one person has set a
[00:38:12] benchmark once somebody's done a pack of
[00:38:14] cards in 40 seconds or 30 seconds or
[00:38:17] something everybody else can get to that
[00:38:18] point so much more quickly because now
[00:38:20] they know it's possible it's crazy I've
[00:38:22] seen this all over the years and now
[00:38:24] we're getting down to 17 seconds or
[00:38:25] something yeah but the thing is I was
[00:38:27] talking about this at the championship
[00:38:29] uh you what you just said is exactly on
[00:38:31] point but there's an added thing is that
[00:38:33] people who have been in the game for a
[00:38:35] while it doesn't make it easier for us
[00:38:37] to get to that point necessarily it's
[00:38:40] easier for the new people to start and
[00:38:42] get to that point we're so ingrained in
[00:38:45] our ways and the mindset of like I can
[00:38:47] do a deck of cards in 25 seconds 25
[00:38:49] seconds 25 seconds that to suddenly say
[00:38:52] oh now I can do it in 18 seconds it's
[00:38:54] like uh I don't know I know it's it's
[00:38:58] I'd love to know a way to get around
[00:38:59] that you know I thought of going and
[00:39:01] seeing a hypnotist and having sort of
[00:39:03] bra something like that but um I'm I'm
[00:39:07] too skeptical about hypnotism now
[00:39:09] because I don't believe that properly
[00:39:10] exists either but you know perhaps one
[00:39:12] of these days someone will convince me
[00:39:14] someone will come up swing a watch in
[00:39:15] front of my face you are feeling sleepy
[00:39:17] and then bang just like that I can
[00:39:19] memorize a pack of cards in 15 seconds
[00:39:21] yeah yeah damn we got to find that guy
[00:39:24] to do it to us last question is there a
[00:39:27] back hiding within that hat is it coming
[00:39:31] back is Ben pmore going to be a world
[00:39:33] champion again I would love to be world
[00:39:35] champion again I'm turning 40 this year
[00:39:38] I'm getting old you know I would like to
[00:39:40] be able to prove that you don't that
[00:39:42] your brain doesn't actually die out as
[00:39:44] you get old and I think it was Phil Ash
[00:39:46] said to me I won the World Championship
[00:39:48] in my 20s in my 30s I could be the first
[00:39:50] person ever to win it in my 40s as well
[00:39:53] you know a whole sort of three decades
[00:39:55] so that is a target but I need to
[00:39:58] overcome the whole motivation thing and
[00:40:00] the whole everybody being better than me
[00:40:02] thing that's a pretty big thing I have
[00:40:03] to
[00:40:04] overcome I can find a way to do it I
[00:40:06] will try to be world champion again all
[00:40:09] right well I'm rooting for you I would
[00:40:11] love to see you back on top it would be
[00:40:12] a very cool story and it would be the
[00:40:14] awesome ending to your
[00:40:17] book
[00:40:18] right I don't like the idea of reaching
[00:40:20] the ending you know end of part one of
[00:40:23] the book maybe and then we go on to
[00:40:24] greater things and then when up 97 and
[00:40:26] winning the world championship for the
[00:40:28] 93rd time it'll be held once a year
[00:40:31] obviously by that point yeah you know
[00:40:33] then that be the end of the book win
[00:40:35] once a decade then you're
[00:40:37] good well all right thank you for your
[00:40:39] time Ben it's been an honor I love
[00:40:41] hearing your stories I'm sure you have a
[00:40:43] million more um but I can't keep you for
[00:40:46] more than the time that I have here
[00:40:48] because people are going to stop
[00:40:49] listening but uh or maybe not me mble I
[00:40:52] hope some of it made some kind of sense
[00:40:53] to someone definitely yeah yeah yeah so
[00:40:56] we hope to see you at the XM
[00:40:57] and uh thank you again for your time Ben
[00:41:00] prore everyone thank you thank you

[00:00:09] all right now this one will be for the
[00:00:11] poster and the shirt and the squeezy
[00:00:13] brain in my direction uh
[00:00:20] [Applause]
[00:00:27] 066 sign by all the
[00:00:45] [Applause]
[00:00:58] editors
[00:01:11] okay so we will start with the surprise
[00:01:15] event which I'll explain there won't be
[00:01:17] a video for this oh there is a video
[00:01:19] never
[00:01:28] mind
[00:01:36] sorry hold
[00:01:58] on
[00:02:12] just plug your computer the
[00:02:28] HTMI
[00:02:58] for
[00:03:29] to
[00:03:39] you
[00:03:42] start welcome back to day three of the
[00:03:45] extreme memory tournament we have the
[00:03:47] third and fourth place finishers today
[00:03:49] that they're the first competitors and
[00:03:51] then we have first and second place
[00:03:53] right after that exactly been an
[00:03:55] incredible tournament some records were
[00:03:58] broken literally every record was some
[00:04:00] records there records all the records
[00:04:02] were broken and then they were broken
[00:04:04] again and again and again even on the
[00:04:06] second day we saw records being broken
[00:04:08] although that's kind of unusual people
[00:04:11] take it more secure on the second day
[00:04:13] because they on these uh in the final
[00:04:15] rounds when um they don't have so many
[00:04:18] matches anymore so nevertheless Katie
[00:04:21] broke her own words was it the words
[00:04:22] record I think in names she's incredible
[00:04:25] at that she has she doesn't even have a
[00:04:26] technique she just memorizes names it's
[00:04:28] incredible and then we have Lance he
[00:04:31] broke another record as well right yeah
[00:04:34] let's let's let's let's have a look at
[00:04:35] these Lance broke the images record he
[00:04:38] had a score of 30 in
[00:04:58] 13.91% I don't know I thought he did but
[00:05:01] doesn't really look you're no you're
[00:05:02] numbers you're numbers click on the
[00:05:03] names yeah no it was on names it's true
[00:05:05] yeah it's true yeah and then numbers we
[00:05:07] have Alex Mullen he crushed it score of
[00:05:10] 80 and
[00:05:12] 17.65 seconds yeah it's amazing so fast
[00:05:15] before that we had the previous world
[00:05:17] record was
[00:05:20] 21.1 and uh this is this is well 3
[00:05:24] seconds faster if you see it in percent
[00:05:26] which is quite a bit and let not forget
[00:05:28] the cards record which is the most
[00:05:31] popular discipline in memory Sports the
[00:05:34] speed cards right we don't call it speed
[00:05:36] cards here but nevertheless it's kind of
[00:05:38] the same discipline we have 52 cards an
[00:05:40] entire deck of poker cards and Alex
[00:05:43] Mullen from United States He memorized
[00:05:45] it in incredible
[00:05:47] 16.86 33 it's less than a second it's
[00:05:52] incredible yeah how do you do that less
[00:05:54] than a second yeah that would be 52
[00:05:56] seconds than
[00:05:57] otherwise um yeah he is memor in two
[00:05:59] cards at a time and um he well actually
[00:06:04] well he has this two card system but
[00:06:06] it's a crazy way how he does that I
[00:06:08] don't want to go too much into details
[00:06:10] but just just to quickly give you an
[00:06:11] idea he's like he looks at the cars and
[00:06:13] he Stacks them up on the location B if
[00:06:16] they follow the same color order and as
[00:06:18] soon as the color switches he goes to
[00:06:20] the next location so sometimes he has in
[00:06:23] in in a very crazy round he might have
[00:06:25] like eight eight images on one occasion
[00:06:28] which is
[00:06:30] very difficult to do but he handles it
[00:06:32] so so um so fantastic yeah it's very
[00:06:36] impressive um and then of course the
[00:06:38] images which in my opinion is the
[00:06:40] coolest discipline of the x andt is my
[00:06:42] favorite because it's it looks so
[00:06:43] gorgeous you have these photos that
[00:06:45] you're memorizing 30 pictures at a time
[00:06:48] um you have 60 seconds like in all these
[00:06:50] five disciplines and Lance crushed it
[00:06:52] with 13. 91 seconds I don't know the
[00:06:55] surprise events are my favorite the
[00:06:57] noises yesterday recalling that we must
[00:06:59] not forget about the surprise events
[00:07:01] they are fantastic I don't know how you
[00:07:02] create that kind of Memory Palace it's
[00:07:05] you there was a sound in a second and
[00:07:07] they kept going was was 20 sounds yeah I
[00:07:10] actually I didn't count them we said
[00:07:11] something like 25 you were playing some
[00:07:14] random sounds to me yeah yeah right we
[00:07:16] played around with a little bit with
[00:07:17] that but let's have a look at what's
[00:07:19] going on in the room because they
[00:07:20] already explaining the surprise event uh
[00:07:25] we haven't really had a look at it we
[00:07:26] have the explanation here so let's let's
[00:07:28] see what they do doing third place match
[00:07:30] is called maze memo and we can already
[00:07:34] see there in the background there on the
[00:07:36] screen that they have this they have
[00:07:40] these tiles and there seems to be a line
[00:07:43] so when they say maze memo I know expect
[00:07:46] that they have to memorize somehow there
[00:07:49] has more than that so let's let's read
[00:07:50] this let's read this to the to the um do
[00:07:52] you want to do that I like your German
[00:07:54] accent oh you like my German accent okay
[00:07:56] let's I will try not to use it over
[00:07:58] stretch with German accent okay um so
[00:08:01] competitor preparation time 2 minutes uh
[00:08:03] post announcement video rules will be
[00:08:05] explained the data is a path through a
[00:08:08] 20 times um times 20 20 * 20 grid um
[00:08:13] memo time is 1 minute recall time is 3
[00:08:15] minutes and then we have equipment is a
[00:08:19] maze shown on a projector we see that
[00:08:21] here on the live stream recall sheet
[00:08:24] this will basically just look the same
[00:08:26] as on a piece of paper and and then we
[00:08:29] have the rules after the explanation is
[00:08:31] over there will be 2 minutes of
[00:08:33] preparation time and then there will be
[00:08:35] a 30-second notification and then a
[00:08:37] 10-second Countdown the maze will be
[00:08:39] shown immediately afterwards on the
[00:08:41] projector for all competitors to see a
[00:08:43] one minute countdown will begin during
[00:08:46] memorization and then after that there
[00:08:47] will be a 20 by 20 grid displayed on
[00:08:50] screen with a path indicated in red
[00:08:52] through the boxes from one corner to the
[00:08:54] other bottom left box to the top right
[00:08:57] box and when the memorization has
[00:08:59] finished we will allow the competitors
[00:09:01] to turn over the recall sheet on our
[00:09:03] count which they will have 3 minutes to
[00:09:05] draw the maze path from memory the
[00:09:08] scoring so that will be done this will
[00:09:09] be a sudden death the winner is whoever
[00:09:12] got further in the Maze correctly a tie
[00:09:14] break is another round but with a maze
[00:09:17] of higher difficulty right so that that
[00:09:21] is pretty interesting although when I
[00:09:23] look at this from my experience is with
[00:09:26] memory techniques I I already have a a
[00:09:28] strategy for that when when I look at
[00:09:31] this example so let's see we have we see
[00:09:34] the first line there from the bottom
[00:09:36] from the bottom left going up 1 2 3 4 5
[00:09:39] 6 7 8 9 10 and then it's going to the
[00:09:42] right so I would probably memorize 10 on
[00:09:45] my first location and I would memorize
[00:09:47] an indication turning right and so I
[00:09:50] would have something like um like a
[00:09:52] flame or put it in ice or put it in
[00:09:54] jelly to indicate left or right jelly or
[00:09:58] yeah let's let's let's say say I put my
[00:10:00] location into a flame my second location
[00:10:02] now so I memorize 10 Flames Flames
[00:10:06] indicates right and then then I count 1
[00:10:08] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 here to the um so
[00:10:13] I would memorize now
[00:10:15] 11 and I would put um an indication for
[00:10:19] left now because now we're going to the
[00:10:21] left from that position and we could say
[00:10:23] let's put it in an ice block so my
[00:10:25] fourth location would then freeze into
[00:10:27] ice and then I count again da da da da
[00:10:30] so actually it's what I saw here that
[00:10:32] would be only
[00:10:33] like 10 10 images at least from this
[00:10:38] example I guess in the event it might be
[00:10:40] crazier with more left right cuz like at
[00:10:44] this kind of difficult it doesn't seem
[00:10:46] too hard seems like the last surprise
[00:10:48] event was a little bit harder right but
[00:10:50] I'm guessing it's going to be a little
[00:10:51] bit more difficult than what they're
[00:10:53] showing right now probably what we see
[00:10:55] here in the in the sample is a very
[00:10:57] simple variation and I I suspect I don't
[00:11:00] know I haven't we haven't seen that yet
[00:11:02] but when it starts it will look much
[00:11:05] more difficult with many left to right
[00:11:06] left right yeah and yeah also this
[00:11:10] sudden death is is pretty interesting
[00:11:12] you you're not allowed to make a mistake
[00:11:14] you make a mistake one mistake and then
[00:11:16] well when when it says sudden death that
[00:11:17] that means that as soon as you make a
[00:11:20] mistake you're out this we have to say
[00:11:22] so the final rounds it's best out of 10
[00:11:25] it's not best out of seven now so it's
[00:11:27] going to be a little bit longer oh look
[00:11:29] at these isn't it best out of nine is it
[00:11:31] best out of yeah that makes sense it's
[00:11:33] best out of nine cuz it's best out of 10
[00:11:34] you can't do that right so I think it's
[00:11:37] already started now didn't
[00:11:40] it this is this is already it can we get
[00:11:42] a confirmation here from our Tech Team
[00:11:44] this there
[00:11:46] already okay all right
[00:11:48] soor yeah so they're memorizing this is
[00:11:51] it and as you can
[00:11:52] see like we thought it looks way more
[00:11:55] complex than what we did before but
[00:11:57] still the the strategy that explained
[00:12:00] still works I guess actually I'm going
[00:12:02] to correct her us it's actually best out
[00:12:04] of seven for look look at this Nelson
[00:12:06] and Brett just jumped in they were
[00:12:07] blindfolded they couldn't see it yet and
[00:12:10] now now they took off the the blinds now
[00:12:12] they took off the blinds and they're
[00:12:14] starting to memorize now and yeah they
[00:12:18] have one minute for this so let's just
[00:12:20] enjoy the show there what they're doing
[00:12:22] by the way in the in the meantime before
[00:12:24] we started finnally everyone was
[00:12:26] watching the the European footb game
[00:12:29] Germany versus Slovakia on the big
[00:12:31] screen in that room for because of
[00:12:33] technical problems that we were still
[00:12:35] have not because of that but it's
[00:12:36] because we have seven Germans in this
[00:12:38] competition and we have seven Germans in
[00:12:39] the competition and everyone who was not
[00:12:41] from Germany was like what is that I saw
[00:12:43] the Mongolians they put their headphones
[00:12:45] on they don't care about that yeah they
[00:12:46] don't care about that at all what I mean
[00:12:49] while they're still memorizing how how
[00:12:51] you guys in the United States care about
[00:12:53] soccer is that a thing it's getting
[00:12:54] bigger now or is it still tiny thing
[00:12:56] it's I mean we play it in high school
[00:12:58] school and in middle school when we're
[00:13:00] growing up but it's really not a big
[00:13:02] professional sport for us right now but
[00:13:04] it's a fun sport to play isn't it it's a
[00:13:06] I loved playing it but yeah I don't
[00:13:09] think it's going to be as big as
[00:13:10] football basketball or baseball all
[00:13:11] right yeah it's number four in the
[00:13:14] ranking what of of the best games or
[00:13:17] what the top games but I'd rather watch
[00:13:19] Tennis than soccer American American
[00:13:21] football basketball baseball I guess
[00:13:24] that in that order exactly and then
[00:13:27] soccer yeah actually football's first
[00:13:29] basketball the baseball and then soccer
[00:13:32] right yeah why do they why do they call
[00:13:34] American football football they don't
[00:13:36] use their feet I don't know I it's
[00:13:38] stupid anyhow let's let's come back to
[00:13:40] Memories so they have finished
[00:13:41] memorizing him now we see CC writing
[00:13:44] down well not writing actually drawing
[00:13:47] they're drawing the the maze now on
[00:13:49] their um on their sheet of recall I feel
[00:13:53] like you need a ruler for this oh it
[00:13:56] doesn't really matter I guess if it if
[00:13:57] it looks a little bit Messi Messi yeah
[00:14:00] and of course
[00:14:03] um as long as as long as you don't leave
[00:14:05] these tiles and there I when I look at
[00:14:08] this recoil sheet that we have here in
[00:14:09] front of us it it looks good big enough
[00:14:11] shouldn't be too much of a problem let's
[00:14:14] see so yep 30 second notification then
[00:14:16] 10c
[00:14:18] countdown right and remember everyone to
[00:14:21] go to the extreme memory challenge.com
[00:14:23] once again extrem memory challenge.com
[00:14:24] it's a 5 to 10 minute
[00:14:27] survey please go to extreme memory
[00:14:29] challenge.com exactly we mentioned it a
[00:14:32] couple of times but this is this is our
[00:14:34] sponsor um Dart NeuroScience uh the
[00:14:37] other sponsor is Washington University
[00:14:40] and dart is doing this test where they
[00:14:42] have um this This brilliant software um
[00:14:47] that that will test the the person who
[00:14:50] does it on the website and they will ask
[00:14:53] you several things and we cannot go into
[00:14:55] the details there because that would
[00:14:56] ruin the test basically for everyone
[00:14:58] else but it's interesting and I think
[00:15:00] it's a tway it's a two day but it's only
[00:15:03] 5 minute test and they inform you a
[00:15:05] couple days later and it you can compare
[00:15:07] yourself to Nelson dallis the founder of
[00:15:09] extreme memory tournament four-time us
[00:15:11] memory Champion let's see if you're
[00:15:12] better than him exactly you will not get
[00:15:15] an exact result where you are but you
[00:15:17] will get something like you in a in a
[00:15:19] top percentage or in a middle percentage
[00:15:21] or a lower percentage or your average no
[00:15:23] I'm just and yeah and and if you are not
[00:15:26] having a good memory and the test tells
[00:15:28] you while you're on the lower end that
[00:15:29] doesn't that doesn't mean that uh all
[00:15:32] hope is lost because memory techniques
[00:15:34] clearly show us that everyone can pick
[00:15:36] up on that and everyone can improve
[00:15:38] double at least the memory in in no time
[00:15:41] yeah you I can show everyone how to use
[00:15:44] a couple of memory techniques and they
[00:15:45] can memorize a list of 10 20 30 items
[00:15:49] after after an hour easily and and
[00:15:52] double their memory with no effort you
[00:15:54] know what was great so I was having
[00:15:56] dinner last night in downtown San Diego
[00:15:59] and I'm sitting next to this couple and
[00:16:01] they ask me what I'm doing here and I'm
[00:16:03] hosting the extreme memory tournament
[00:16:04] and the guy's like oh my God I love that
[00:16:07] I saw it on TED Talk I need to come and
[00:16:09] they're coming today to watch it I just
[00:16:10] love hearing that oh really cool you
[00:16:12] know it's really spreading so he said he
[00:16:15] saw on TED Talk was someone mentioning
[00:16:17] someone was mentioning the techniques
[00:16:19] and mentioning you know memory
[00:16:20] tournaments yeah I've seen I've seen
[00:16:22] Yoshua 4 on on TED Talk the author of uh
[00:16:25] Moon walking with Einstein with his like
[00:16:27] the book that kicked it off in the
[00:16:29] United States and Beyond and I also saw
[00:16:33] Idris so guy from Sweden on a on a TED
[00:16:36] Talk I saw Boris who's here today Dr
[00:16:39] Boris Conrad he sits he sits now in the
[00:16:41] in the auditorium watching the our
[00:16:45] finalist um can we get a shot of people
[00:16:47] in the auditorium actually yeah do we
[00:16:48] have a camera that we can swing around
[00:16:51] and and show how this looks
[00:16:57] like
[00:17:08] other competitors that we had before so
[00:17:11] yeah that's that's pretty exciting let's
[00:17:13] come back to our comp third place uh
[00:17:18] Fighters what do you what do you call
[00:17:20] this the the third place the game for
[00:17:22] third place not that's not really a nice
[00:17:26] name third place match yeah someone told
[00:17:29] me to a friend of mine told me today his
[00:17:32] advice don't do a third place match why
[00:17:35] because people don't like that is that
[00:17:38] is that true I think it's interesting
[00:17:40] and cool and I really like the idea to
[00:17:41] see more of joh one person will win
[00:17:45] 7,500 the other person will win 5,000
[00:17:47] they they win they win a big prize cash
[00:17:49] exactly and we will and you can still
[00:17:51] break records yeah and we will establish
[00:17:53] who will be one to three yeah on on the
[00:17:56] letter basically at the end I'm really
[00:17:57] hoping CC gets third place well
[00:18:01] sheale she's from
[00:18:04] Mongolia it's true I mean so it's always
[00:18:07] too difficult for me to really be
[00:18:08] objective about these kind of things
[00:18:10] Johanna is such a good friend of mine I
[00:18:12] was I was there at his first memory
[00:18:14] champion no his first memory
[00:18:16] championship in 2004 in Berlin uh by
[00:18:18] then he was still able to walk actually
[00:18:20] he um he already had this he already had
[00:18:23] his disease this um um genetic disease
[00:18:26] that is shrinking away his
[00:18:29] vertical
[00:18:30] muscles uh you could already see that he
[00:18:33] had problems walking because he had to
[00:18:34] walk on his bone structure um because
[00:18:37] the muscles were already pretty pretty
[00:18:39] tough he had to go into the wheelchair I
[00:18:41] think when would that happen 2011 2011
[00:18:44] yeah that was there was the time when it
[00:18:46] got just too too difficult for him to
[00:18:48] walk he can still walk by the way he can
[00:18:50] still walk but it's very very dangerous
[00:18:53] for him because he when he when he falls
[00:18:55] then yeah and he has the strongest mind
[00:18:58] he has exactly he's the number one in
[00:19:01] the world on on the world rankings right
[00:19:04] and no one has ever done such an amazing
[00:19:06] thing with so many points in the
[00:19:08] traditional memory championships but
[00:19:09] here we see they are done now they are
[00:19:12] handing out the papers to bretts up who
[00:19:15] will now check the maze that they did
[00:19:17] there and we will see what they
[00:19:27] did
[00:19:57] now
[00:20:01] [Music]
[00:20:19] [Music]
[00:20:27] start
[00:20:40] so they made
[00:20:43] it made it to
[00:20:47] here so not
[00:20:50] bad johanis went a little further but
[00:20:52] this section was a little
[00:20:57] off
[00:20:58] okay so we will give you another 30
[00:21:00] second prep
[00:21:02] time this maze will be a bit harder than
[00:21:05] this
[00:21:07] one a bit harder that means more turns
[00:21:12] right so we will put the blindfolds on
[00:21:14] and give you a 30 second countdown and
[00:21:18] then remove them and show you the new
[00:21:19] one we gave you some extra worksheets if
[00:21:22] you want to start
[00:21:27] over
[00:21:42] okay CC okay okay 30 second Prem
[00:21:46] memorization Starts
[00:21:57] Now
[00:22:18] all right and we are back um we just saw
[00:22:21] that the competitors there for the third
[00:22:25] round johanes and CeCe are not going
[00:22:27] into to their second attempt and Nelson
[00:22:30] already said this one will be harder
[00:22:32] than the first one so it already
[00:22:36] looked sophisticated first one to say
[00:22:39] the least so now definitely to me when
[00:22:41] when he says it's harder then I suspect
[00:22:44] there will be a lot of lot of turns left
[00:22:46] and right I was just mentioning the max
[00:22:47] wow look at this this is a it's a little
[00:22:49] bit like binary code so you could say
[00:22:51] binary code what we also do in the
[00:22:53] traditional championships is left right
[00:22:55] left right left right or Z 010 1 but
[00:22:58] this is not quite it because you can
[00:23:00] also go straight ahead so it's more like
[00:23:02] a quantum computer who does Z ones and
[00:23:06] this third state uh that doesn't really
[00:23:09] help them at all this um this knowledge
[00:23:12] but yeah it's interesting looks actually
[00:23:14] quite beautiful what they did there this
[00:23:16] right now reminds me of a golf match
[00:23:18] just how quiet everyone is and you can't
[00:23:21] really talk you just need to watch
[00:23:26] exactly yeah and I also just want to
[00:23:29] lean back here and see and watch and
[00:23:31] enjoy the show there and now it's done
[00:23:32] if the 60 seconds they had to memorize
[00:23:35] this are over and they get into position
[00:23:39] to start drawing again get back to the
[00:23:42] drawing board
[00:23:43] basically taking the blindfolds away
[00:23:46] here we go yeah
[00:23:49] and Max already said he preferred the
[00:23:52] the sound event yeah that why is that
[00:23:55] just it's more exciting to me I mean I
[00:23:57] like like this this shows their skills
[00:23:59] but right I feel like it brings it more
[00:24:01] to life on screen it's true it has it
[00:24:04] has something
[00:24:05] more um for the audience I guess but on
[00:24:09] the other hand I really like this as
[00:24:10] well looks but you know what would have
[00:24:12] been really cool if they showed the
[00:24:13] person drawing it true at that time
[00:24:16] actually would be really cool if we
[00:24:17] could have if we could get the camera
[00:24:19] behind them and and but it would
[00:24:21] probably distract them so don't don't
[00:24:22] send in the camera team now to to go
[00:24:25] behind their backs that would be good
[00:24:27] but would be cool
[00:24:28] actually production crew yeah of course
[00:24:31] we have a really cool production crew I
[00:24:32] mean everything that is happening here
[00:24:34] with all this videos and the uh the
[00:24:36] cameras this the first year and they're
[00:24:38] doing a great job I remember how I did
[00:24:40] it in the first year I did
[00:24:41] Alone um with a Google Hangout stream I
[00:24:45] didn't I didn't have a cool cool host
[00:24:47] like you I didn't I didn't have a team I
[00:24:49] didn't have these cameras so I had to go
[00:24:51] with my iPad and I think I actually I
[00:24:54] had several cameras wired together on on
[00:24:57] the Google Hangouts you know like my
[00:24:59] phone my iPad and stuff like that it
[00:25:01] wasn't that bad but I had to talk all
[00:25:03] day alone and I now now one but not for
[00:25:07] you well and and it it didn't look as as
[00:25:11] cool as what we have here not even by
[00:25:13] far but it's also showing you that it
[00:25:15] keeps getting better and better every
[00:25:17] year right and also and the future is
[00:25:19] bright yeah exactly and also what we um
[00:25:21] another thing is that we have all this
[00:25:23] video material we are saving this we
[00:25:26] have it in high quality so everyone
[00:25:28] who's watching the live stream right now
[00:25:30] you will see this I think in um good
[00:25:33] quality it looks pretty cool great but
[00:25:36] um we have it in even better quality and
[00:25:38] we will cut and edit it later and throw
[00:25:40] out some short videos because what we
[00:25:42] are doing here 3 days all day long not
[00:25:45] everyone has the time to to follow that
[00:25:47] they have family they have life they
[00:25:49] have work I don't know so um we can some
[00:25:53] do some really cool material with what
[00:25:55] we did here on this weekend yeah and I'm
[00:25:57] not not going to go into detail about
[00:25:58] the future of xmt but there are some
[00:26:02] rumors and some pretty good things that
[00:26:04] might happen next year yes um yes the XM
[00:26:07] well um well we can throw some some bits
[00:26:11] into the room which say will be even
[00:26:13] better that and also not just that that
[00:26:16] that it will be better but it will also
[00:26:18] expand the xmt will expand and will not
[00:26:21] just say this one big event once a year
[00:26:25] there will be more you know what I was
[00:26:27] thinking about I'm switching topics but
[00:26:29] for the winner of the third place let's
[00:26:31] say if the Mongolians both win they
[00:26:33] can't celebrate with like you know the
[00:26:35] regular celebration where you have
[00:26:36] champagne they're both one's 15 the
[00:26:38] other one's like 17 years old well in
[00:26:39] Germany you could actually it's a 16
[00:26:42] actually uh Pui could could drink Pui
[00:26:45] yeah CC would have to wait a
[00:26:47] month yeah no I mean we can we can get
[00:26:52] some some some soda or something when
[00:26:55] they win I was also thinking about how
[00:26:57] difficult it is for some the Mongolians
[00:26:59] because they don't they're not the best
[00:27:01] at you know speaking English and well
[00:27:03] actually they're doing quite a good job
[00:27:04] I think CC speaks pretty decent English
[00:27:07] I don't know so much about Pui yeah Pui
[00:27:10] but he speaks also English but I think
[00:27:12] CCE speaks better English but despite I
[00:27:15] mean that's not really relevant for the
[00:27:18] for the competition as you see because
[00:27:20] no but when they're describing some
[00:27:22] things like the surprise event it's a
[00:27:23] little difficult sure that's true yeah
[00:27:26] that's actually true the surprise events
[00:27:27] might be a bit more difficult for them
[00:27:29] to to understand and interpret there but
[00:27:34] here we go so far she seems confident
[00:27:36] let's see let's see how the results are
[00:27:38] when they come in they are now waiting
[00:27:39] does I love their faces after
[00:27:42] yeah just looking down they don't know
[00:27:45] what to do well just wait everyone is
[00:27:48] now waiting CeCe is turning around come
[00:27:51] on guys results I want to see that I
[00:27:54] feel like yanas is a little scared she's
[00:27:57] a great competitor she is a great compe
[00:27:59] let me show you guys how far she went
[00:28:00] you went very
[00:28:15] far so CC made it all the
[00:28:19] way down
[00:28:22] here all
[00:28:25] this and I think she made the mistake
[00:28:34] here so CC goes up 1 Z and we'll
[00:28:38] continue
[00:28:39] with with the normal structure of
[00:28:47] events not that
[00:28:50] far you cares to share or
[00:28:56] not
[00:29:00] so johannas it will be your turn to
[00:29:02] choose what would you like
[00:29:04] cards we starting with
[00:29:12] [Music]
[00:29:16] cards it looks like CCE just won this
[00:29:19] event so it's one cc she's up above
[00:29:23] johanes all right this this is
[00:29:26] incredible I mean this is
[00:29:27] again the the the young competitors here
[00:29:31] are winning the surprise events was the
[00:29:33] same yesterday wasn't it that that she
[00:29:35] won that she won um her surprise events
[00:29:40] so and remember this is best out of
[00:29:41] seven so that's a very big win right
[00:29:43] there best out of nine I think or best
[00:29:45] of n is only for the final yeah yeah
[00:29:47] right so this match is still like we um
[00:29:49] saw
[00:29:51] yesterday all right
[00:29:54] um so now we come back to the
[00:29:57] traditional disciplines she's stapling
[00:29:59] on her uh exactly her her blinders and
[00:30:04] since CeCe won that surprise event it
[00:30:07] was now Johannes p and he seemed to have
[00:30:10] settled for cards
[00:30:12] interestingly that's isn't that his
[00:30:16] specialty no it's not his specialty he's
[00:30:18] good at it he he can he can easily do
[00:30:21] under 30 seconds she CeCe is very good
[00:30:23] at images I think he's I think he
[00:30:25] suspects her that cards is not really
[00:30:29] her strength so this is why he chose
[00:30:32] that in fact um we should have a we
[00:30:35] should have look actually what what cc
[00:30:37] is doing let let us pull up let us pull
[00:30:40] up her her card here on the XT life.com
[00:30:44] website when we click on the on CC's
[00:30:47] name then I'm doing that on my iPad
[00:30:50] which is super slow right now you're
[00:30:52] faster all right so so card's her
[00:30:55] highest is 38 seconds all right so this
[00:30:57] is clearly an indication why yanana
[00:31:00] picked that 38 seconds is a fantastic
[00:31:02] score right I mean try to do 38 seconds
[00:31:05] let's look at johanes right now cards he
[00:31:07] is 22.7 s seconds that's far above much
[00:31:12] better and he's ranked number two in
[00:31:14] cards so good choice by him here we go
[00:31:17] so she does a three card system he does
[00:31:19] two cards um memorization will end in 45
[00:31:23] seconds right cc is using a PA o system
[00:31:27] a so-called person action object system
[00:31:30] where she has 100 people 100 objects 100
[00:31:35] actions in her number system and for the
[00:31:37] cards she takes out of that system 52 of
[00:31:40] these images each of each of those rows
[00:31:42] and they put them into an into a row oh
[00:31:45] it it's getting really close right now
[00:31:47] yeah and she puts that that cluster ofo
[00:31:50] on one location Johan has finished in
[00:31:52] 36.5 s seconds not the fastest time he
[00:31:55] but he has the advantage
[00:31:57] slow for him so he might be pretty
[00:31:59] secure about this I think yeah it looks
[00:32:01] like he's won this event like always now
[00:32:04] cc is taking it taking it slow and goes
[00:32:07] for the entire 60 seconds by the way the
[00:32:09] more I see that the more I I wonder if
[00:32:12] that's actually the best approach for
[00:32:14] the xmt because now we have someone is
[00:32:17] going for a fast time or an intermediate
[00:32:19] fast time and the other one sees that he
[00:32:22] or she stopped before and then
[00:32:24] automatically goes for 60 seconds yeah
[00:32:26] but with this I think she needed a
[00:32:28] faster time because he always does great
[00:32:29] even if it's under 60 seconds he always
[00:32:31] gets 52 cards
[00:32:34] right but she's starting out strong he's
[00:32:36] starting from the top she's starting
[00:32:38] from the bottom but now we're here yeah
[00:32:41] well I mean the system of the xmt here
[00:32:44] really forces you logically to to do
[00:32:48] what I just said here right you the
[00:32:50] first one has a f faster time than you
[00:32:53] then it doesn't really make sense for
[00:32:54] you to stop it now or 5 seconds later
[00:32:56] just go for the entire time exactly you
[00:32:58] review it all um so do you think we
[00:33:02] should add points
[00:33:05] for how fast you do it
[00:33:09] too well maybe so you don't you can't
[00:33:11] always use the 60 seconds maybe it would
[00:33:13] be or maybe there's you can only use 60
[00:33:14] seconds a certain amount of times I like
[00:33:16] that thought maybe maybe you we have to
[00:33:19] look into that for the future to
[00:33:22] um give our athletes a a
[00:33:28] um yeah some motivation to actually not
[00:33:31] take it super super slow I mean 60
[00:33:33] seconds is still fast time right
[00:33:35] everyone who want who goes under 60
[00:33:37] seconds with a deck of cards will
[00:33:38] celebrate that event for the rest of
[00:33:40] their lives even if they can do it later
[00:33:43] much faster then but 60 seconds is
[00:33:45] really a huge milestone but yeah right
[00:33:48] nevertheless we as the as The Spectators
[00:33:51] here we of course we want to see Crazy
[00:33:53] Fast Times and it would be cool if both
[00:33:55] of them are always going for Fast Times
[00:33:58] despite the fact that one of them will
[00:34:00] be slightly faster but like we said
[00:34:02] every competitor is getting stronger and
[00:34:04] they're getting
[00:34:06] faster and it's going to have to get
[00:34:08] it's going to have to change well I'm
[00:34:11] sure I'm sure um Nelson and the look at
[00:34:14] that Johan just switched all the cards
[00:34:16] and now he he looks like he's going to
[00:34:18] get 52 right he's he looks confident
[00:34:21] there two more cards yeah that's that's
[00:34:24] a point for him and it puts him on tie
[00:34:27] one against that it's one one versus one
[00:34:31] or how do you say that one one it's one1
[00:34:32] it's one1 it's tied up one1 it's it's
[00:34:34] already W against who this Rush memory
[00:34:37] champ um Russ R Us memory champ this is
[00:34:40] on
[00:34:41] Twitter I support
[00:34:43] Germany um you are reading at Twitter
[00:34:47] Twitter feed right here I someone is
[00:34:49] supporting Germany at Russ memory champ
[00:34:52] it looks like one of the's it's a r I
[00:34:54] think it's I think it's a Russ Russian
[00:34:57] and also it says Russ memory so I guess
[00:34:59] it's um someone from Russia someone from
[00:35:02] Russia memory fan from Russia hello
[00:35:04] memory fan from Russia you're supporting
[00:35:05] the German team thank you very
[00:35:08] much um we are trying to be a little bit
[00:35:12] more objective here on the um on the
[00:35:14] commentator bench we are for both of
[00:35:16] them defitely both the best May the best
[00:35:19] win I don't know about you I'm for both
[00:35:21] of them but you're from Germany I yeah
[00:35:23] I'm from Germany but I'm also a
[00:35:25] professional here and I'm I'm happy with
[00:35:27] when CC wins she's she's great she
[00:35:29] earned it she's fantastic and the
[00:35:31] Mongolian team is so good I'm just
[00:35:33] looking for this to go to seven I want
[00:35:35] to see seven games and I already said it
[00:35:37] during the last two days I'm always for
[00:35:39] the underdog and Johannes is the top one
[00:35:41] in the world that makes him clearly not
[00:35:42] the underdog and um therefore it would
[00:35:45] be great when CC wins and it would be
[00:35:47] fantastic for her it would be fantastic
[00:35:49] for memory Sports for the Mongolian team
[00:35:51] so so many advantages why she should win
[00:35:54] but nevertheless May the best be win so
[00:35:56] let's follow what's going on here next
[00:35:58] match be images this was cce's pick I
[00:36:01] think she needs to get like we need to
[00:36:03] get her something instead of putting
[00:36:04] paper and the headphones on yeah let's
[00:36:07] let us let us talk with Ola karisa from
[00:36:11] Norway who was our competitor in the
[00:36:13] last two years yeah um he's also in the
[00:36:16] top rankings in the world he couldn't
[00:36:17] make it this year so he didn't even I
[00:36:19] think he didn't even try to qualify and
[00:36:21] he has this fantastic baseball cap with
[00:36:24] this en longed and en longed
[00:36:27] um blinders at the side looks pretty
[00:36:29] cool I feel like people are going to
[00:36:31] have they're going to be look fancy and
[00:36:33] stylish in the next tournaments actually
[00:36:35] it's a business idea when this sport is
[00:36:37] growing we can we should sell these kind
[00:36:40] of things we should we sell okay Max Max
[00:36:42] and me we will we will say all the
[00:36:45] memory Gadgets in the future we will
[00:36:47] come up with the coolest stuff and and
[00:36:50] goggles too and goggles right really
[00:36:52] cool goggles
[00:36:54] that that blink and I don't
[00:36:57] know with a projector on them now we go
[00:37:01] here's the memorization we're on
[00:37:03] images looks like there similar is
[00:37:06] slightly faster there but she might no
[00:37:10] no no no no he is he was faster he
[00:37:13] already he's already done yeah because
[00:37:15] our our visual from the page is lagging
[00:37:18] 10 seconds
[00:37:20] behind um oh look at this
[00:37:23] 18.53% n6 CCE couldn't really see him
[00:37:26] stop they normally they get this
[00:37:28] indication of a blue border around the
[00:37:30] screen but this was so close together
[00:37:32] that she didn't really see that in time
[00:37:34] she already stopped it or she might have
[00:37:36] because she um heard him or saw that she
[00:37:38] might have tapped it too it's a
[00:37:40] possibility of course but I think when
[00:37:42] it's so close together then she didn't
[00:37:45] see that and she she might even suspect
[00:37:50] that she she might be faster than him or
[00:37:52] she saw in the last second but her
[00:37:54] finger was already on the on the
[00:37:55] stopping button she couldn't pull back
[00:37:57] anymore Floria let's see if you have a
[00:37:59] good memory when's my
[00:38:02] birthday did you tell me that I told you
[00:38:05] this I have no idea it's
[00:38:08] tomorrow it's tomorrow yes when did you
[00:38:10] tell me that I told you every day I
[00:38:12] thought you were going to get me a
[00:38:13] present so read tomorrow you didn't tell
[00:38:15] me that every day I know you're lying
[00:38:18] but it is tomorrow it is tomorrow yeah
[00:38:20] that's cool thank you it is cool all
[00:38:23] right now they're in recall
[00:38:25] mode
[00:38:27] johannas is starting from the
[00:38:34] top and I'm just getting an information
[00:38:36] here from Kevin Schultz from Germany who
[00:38:38] is always correcting me when I say
[00:38:40] something wrong here in our live stream
[00:38:41] that's fantastic thank you Kevin Kevin
[00:38:43] you're the man Ola did the first four
[00:38:46] events of qualification he says and even
[00:38:48] with not doing the last event he would
[00:38:50] have qualified but he pulled
[00:38:53] out nevertheless for whatever reasons he
[00:38:56] couldn't do it he didn't want to do
[00:38:57] maybe he doesn't like San Diego no I
[00:38:59] don't think so he probably just had
[00:39:01] other reasons why he couldn't come look
[00:39:03] at them they're both uh doing very very
[00:39:06] well right
[00:39:09] now looks like Johannes is going to Edge
[00:39:12] her no no no CeCe done sorry CE done wow
[00:39:16] perfect recall for CeCe yanas is still
[00:39:18] working oh there's the first mistake
[00:39:20] coming in for him and that's completely
[00:39:22] off that's not that's not even images
[00:39:24] who are like switched those two but they
[00:39:27] are completely in the wrong position
[00:39:28] there look how strong CeCe is I mean
[00:39:30] she's not far off from the world record
[00:39:34] at
[00:39:55] 18.96% four other people with yeah but
[00:39:58] but really believe me when you are
[00:39:59] coming oh yanas just switched it in the
[00:40:02] last and Y in the last seconds there and
[00:40:05] he's not correct let's see he hopefully
[00:40:07] he doesn't change anything like
[00:40:09] yesterday when he did that he already
[00:40:11] had everything correct and then but he
[00:40:12] looks confident right now he doesn't
[00:40:14] look stressed well that doesn't
[00:40:16] necessarily mean that he will not switch
[00:40:19] it yep right so let's see what's
[00:40:21] happening in the next 1 minute and 45
[00:40:24] seconds here you know what I haven't
[00:40:25] noticed are they allowed to drink
[00:40:27] anything near the computers have a drink
[00:40:30] sure why shouldn't they
[00:40:31] because yeah and that could be a tactic
[00:40:35] is get out of are these computers their
[00:40:37] own computers or are they provided by
[00:40:38] the they're provided by xmt well I don't
[00:40:41] know but I I'm sure they they're allowed
[00:40:43] to drink because it's super important to
[00:40:45] to get your liquid by the way I should
[00:40:46] drink more water my wife was
[00:40:48] already asking me to this one did you
[00:40:51] drink enough water that's cute yeah she
[00:40:54] she cares about she always cares so much
[00:40:55] about is she watching right now um no I
[00:40:58] don't think so she's in Spain right now
[00:41:01] with our little baby girl and enjoying
[00:41:04] Madrid are you going to visit them we
[00:41:07] are um we are meeting in Berlin actually
[00:41:11] she's flying tomorrow to Berlin to meet
[00:41:13] look at you you world traveler yeah so
[00:41:16] it's Germany and then England again and
[00:41:18] then Costa Rica again it's you're a
[00:41:20] lucky man good times you're a lucky man
[00:41:23] all right oh we are on the screen again
[00:41:24] oh no you want to switched switches
[00:41:26] images well Johan is come on no he's
[00:41:30] going to win this event he's he's like
[00:41:31] getting into this uh making everything
[00:41:33] right and them getting it wrong again
[00:41:36] what I see you can't second guess
[00:41:37] yourself in this sport you can't exactly
[00:41:41] I usually see they're correct second
[00:41:43] guessing is incredibly dangerous here
[00:41:46] and and this is what I saw from my own
[00:41:48] experience in um in memorizing whenever
[00:41:50] you have um a hinge yeah
[00:41:55] intuitive IDE idea of what could be
[00:41:57] there even even though you're unsure
[00:42:00] just take it put it in there because be
[00:42:02] 90% of the cases at least in my own
[00:42:04] experience you're right let's look at
[00:42:06] him right now 4 seconds his reaction I
[00:42:09] mean this is really
[00:42:11] like yeah and he's doing the same
[00:42:14] movement he did yesterday again he's
[00:42:16] like knocking with his with his knuckles
[00:42:19] at his forehead a sorry that's a tough
[00:42:22] look at him look at him I mean he had a
[00:42:24] smirk on his face for a moment there
[00:42:26] he's just he just no man it's stupid
[00:42:29] what he did there maybe Cece's a little
[00:42:31] intimidating look at her intimidating
[00:42:34] just staring at him with no reaction
[00:42:36] didn't didn't PJ did something like that
[00:42:38] as well yester like like he he fist
[00:42:41] pumped at him he fist pumped at his
[00:42:42] opponent Alex Alex M twice he went two
[00:42:45] fist pumps right in his
[00:42:48] face Mongolians are show yeah I mean
[00:42:50] they they are Fierce they are Fierce
[00:42:53] that's the word I mean and I understand
[00:42:55] I I don't I don't really see that as as
[00:42:58] an offensive gesture they will shake
[00:43:01] hands afterwards and and they respect
[00:43:03] each other but in this moment they're
[00:43:05] fighting for a lot of money they're
[00:43:06] fighting for the fame of becoming um
[00:43:10] number three at the xmt you study a lot
[00:43:13] for the and there is there is of course
[00:43:16] some some some what do you call this
[00:43:19] when you do this psychological warfare
[00:43:21] at a a um at a sports event especially
[00:43:25] at a mind sports event and they do these
[00:43:27] kind of Mind Tricks in in chess as well
[00:43:30] somehow don't they yeah you psych them
[00:43:33] out yeah yeah you psych him
[00:43:36] out wow and this and this from such a
[00:43:38] young
[00:43:40] competitor she really has one the world
[00:43:43] this is actually actually is pretty cool
[00:43:45] she didn't even react to that one right
[00:43:47] there and maybe we over interpreted as
[00:43:49] well no I don't think so you don't think
[00:43:51] so that was that was on purpose like we
[00:43:54] saw it oh yeah okay
[00:43:56] all right I mean that's cool I can live
[00:43:59] I can live with that as as long as
[00:44:01] everything stays fair and and so on and
[00:44:04] it is it's cool no I like I like adding
[00:44:06] that to the tournament you don't always
[00:44:07] have to be nice to everyone I don't like
[00:44:09] that everyone's shaking hands hugging
[00:44:11] but on the other hand memory Sports is a
[00:44:13] very familiar sport a very friendly
[00:44:15] sport we we like each other each other
[00:44:18] it's it's not so much like in boxing for
[00:44:20] example when you really trash talk down
[00:44:22] the other one I will destroy him and
[00:44:24] he's ugly and stupid we will never do
[00:44:26] that here in memory spots and even even
[00:44:28] in the you never know you never know oh
[00:44:31] the speed it looks like they're tied up
[00:44:33] and Johan's just beat now she's going to
[00:44:37] review while we were while we were still
[00:44:38] talking here like always um they have
[00:44:40] already picked the next event it was
[00:44:42] numbers I think it was Johan's pick this
[00:44:44] time again and he did it in 29.2 seconds
[00:44:47] expected for his for his number pick
[00:44:50] here who um and johanes was the the
[00:44:54] world record holder in numbers is he is
[00:44:58] he still that actually there was a new
[00:45:00] record coming in I think it's not
[00:45:02] Johannes anymore nowan who is the
[00:45:04] current numbers record it's an Alex with
[00:45:07] 1765 right but nevertheless Johannes is
[00:45:10] still one of the top compar there great
[00:45:13] for the numbers
[00:45:15] and yeah he did it in under 30 seconds
[00:45:18] Alex took home let's say 10 grand in the
[00:45:22] tournament he did great uh well he he
[00:45:25] broke two records
[00:45:27] ,000 and then let's
[00:45:29] see how was the so I think distribution
[00:45:33] yeah so he took home $6,500 that's
[00:45:36] pretty good that's pretty good money
[00:45:38] yeah he basically took the same amount
[00:45:40] as a third place finisher whoever
[00:45:42] finishes here because both of these
[00:45:43] people did not break a record in this
[00:45:50] event all right so both have green on
[00:45:53] their screen although yanas had already
[00:45:55] in Omission there that means the image
[00:45:58] that didn't come right away to him but
[00:46:00] doesn't doesn't mean anything C no CC
[00:46:02] corrected
[00:46:04] herself she is one strong
[00:46:09] competitor look at her she just finished
[00:46:12] yeah so she's done perfect score there
[00:46:14] but only 60 seconds Johannes twice as
[00:46:17] fast he needs to get it together to get
[00:46:18] the point johanes get this to seven
[00:46:20] games come on yeah we we need a we need
[00:46:23] a long long run here otherwise this the
[00:46:26] xmt will be faster over than we can we I
[00:46:29] go to the beach extreme memory
[00:46:32] tournament it's not about always going
[00:46:34] to the
[00:46:37] beach what are you talking
[00:46:41] about all right this is hilarious
[00:46:43] honestly I really I really I really um
[00:46:46] appreciate that that we are doing this
[00:46:47] together
[00:46:48] because you bring you bring a a nice a
[00:46:52] nice humor into all of this I'm I'm
[00:46:55] always so serious about all this
[00:46:57] analyzing talking about the techniques
[00:46:58] blah blah blah blah you like come on
[00:47:00] look at this look at this little fly
[00:47:02] that is here on the table talk about the
[00:47:04] little
[00:47:05] FL no
[00:47:08] that's but I do think next time we need
[00:47:11] to get more in their brain and really
[00:47:13] talk about their Memory Palace cuz yeah
[00:47:16] next next time we will put we will put
[00:47:18] brain scanners on their head and and we
[00:47:21] will analyze what is flashing what is
[00:47:22] flashing up with the neurons and see how
[00:47:26] what areas are being used actually I
[00:47:28] just I just read an article that they
[00:47:30] can that they can kind of already see
[00:47:33] your thoughts somehow at least visualize
[00:47:35] it in a way they probably don't know
[00:47:36] exactly what you're thinking but they
[00:47:38] can already visualize it in a in such in
[00:47:40] such a good detail that they not just
[00:47:44] saying ah he's using his visual cortex
[00:47:46] right now but but more precise than that
[00:47:49] oh God that'll be good for my girlfriend
[00:47:50] she can always really be inside my
[00:47:54] head yeah
[00:47:56] all right so johannas still has his
[00:47:58] Omission there he is thinking hard it's
[00:48:00] so tough for him to do this to re to
[00:48:03] find a missing image because he has a
[00:48:05] thousand images CC only has well 300 but
[00:48:09] you can actually even break it down to
[00:48:11] 100 she just has to scan her 100 only
[00:48:14] 300 yeah well it's it's actually not
[00:48:18] that much I can I can show you how to
[00:48:19] create such a system in a very short
[00:48:21] time but look at this Johannes is
[00:48:23] struggling right now he only has 50
[00:48:24] seconds to recall these last six
[00:48:29] numbers patiently waiting for him to tie
[00:48:32] this up it's difficult I mean you have
[00:48:33] to go through 1,000 images which you
[00:48:35] probably cannot do in that time so he
[00:48:37] kind of flies over them and tries to
[00:48:39] think in categories what I'm picturing
[00:48:41] is what's that Tom Cruz movie Minority
[00:48:44] Report and they're just sing I was just
[00:48:46] watching that the other a few days ago
[00:48:48] actually that's what I'm picturing in
[00:48:49] their mind they're swiping things out
[00:48:51] different memories yeah I mean what he
[00:48:53] told me that when he has the this he
[00:48:56] tries to think of was it was it a person
[00:48:58] was it an animal was it was it an object
[00:49:01] if it was an object what kind of object
[00:49:02] could it have been and then he jumps
[00:49:04] back and forth he's not really having a
[00:49:06] category system that allows him to do
[00:49:08] that but he can still kind of get a
[00:49:10] glimpse of it but it doesn't look good
[00:49:12] look 4 seconds 3 seconds he doesn't he
[00:49:14] just puts in
[00:49:15] zeros and again he gets one zero right
[00:49:18] there but it doesn't
[00:49:19] help CC has a perfect score and it's
[00:49:22] another point for her that's amazing so
[00:49:25] that was a big loss the last one he
[00:49:28] could have won that it would have been
[00:49:29] tied two2 now she's up 3-1 one more win
[00:49:33] and she gets third
[00:49:36] place wow CeCe is doing so good and
[00:49:40] there was Simon and for a second in the
[00:49:42] in the video he's probably already
[00:49:44] getting getting ready for for his own
[00:49:48] match or he might want to get to the
[00:49:50] side to um comfort johannas if he's
[00:49:55] going to lose that those two are
[00:49:57] incredibly good friends for many many
[00:49:59] years and actually because they're so
[00:50:02] good friends and they have practiced
[00:50:04] together they be they got so good
[00:50:06] because they were like the super teag
[00:50:08] team practicing practicing via Skype
[00:50:11] because they live in different cities
[00:50:13] together for for quite a while and they
[00:50:15] had this they invented basically the
[00:50:17] pattern breaking the uh not the pattern
[00:50:20] breaking the plateau breaking which
[00:50:21] Joshua 4 mentioned in the moon walking
[00:50:24] with Einstein they started to memorize
[00:50:27] way more than they could handle
[00:50:29] accepting a lot of mistakes analyzing
[00:50:31] their mistakes and then learning from
[00:50:33] that and getting better and better I
[00:50:35] think when Johannes did that he was
[00:50:37] somewhere in the early 200 digits in 5
[00:50:39] minutes and he always wanted to get this
[00:50:42] these 300 by then I think the world
[00:50:44] record was somewhere in the 330 333 or
[00:50:47] something like that I'm not quite I'm
[00:50:49] not exactly sure what's exactly that
[00:50:51] record there but he wanted to get to 300
[00:50:53] so he said he told him myself I will I
[00:50:56] will not memorize
[00:50:57] 225 because my personal best is 220 I
[00:51:00] will just do 300 I will make a lot of
[00:51:02] mistakes accepting that and then and he
[00:51:04] got there and when he got there he did
[00:51:06] he said to himself okay let's do another
[00:51:08] let's do 100 more now which is crazy but
[00:51:10] it worked and then he got to 400 and
[00:51:12] then he said again do 100 more and he
[00:51:14] got to 500 he was I think he was the
[00:51:17] second one in the history of memory
[00:51:19] Sports who got the 500 the first one was
[00:51:20] Wang Fang from China are you confident
[00:51:23] that he can come back
[00:51:26] everyone are you really confident right
[00:51:29] now give your PR of course last last
[00:51:31] year he did it um the question is can he
[00:51:35] can he does he want do it
[00:51:37] psychologically and honestly for some
[00:51:40] reason for some reason I think he
[00:51:42] doesn't really want that for for some
[00:51:45] reason I think that's what I'm feeling
[00:51:46] too I think he's he's just happy he's
[00:51:49] happy that he got so far again and he
[00:51:53] might even subconsciously think that she
[00:51:56] deserves it more than him I don't know
[00:51:58] yeah and I mean she is she is really
[00:51:59] cool this like young little girl who is
[00:52:01] doing so
[00:52:03] good he has won so many titles talking
[00:52:06] to johannas yeah exactly he just seemed
[00:52:08] to relax it's like I'm going to take one
[00:52:09] day at a time right I don't care so they
[00:52:12] have now the next pick this is names and
[00:52:14] there was a pick from CCE I feel like
[00:52:16] yeah cc is much better at Nam and as we
[00:52:18] have seen they're both on par with names
[00:52:21] H with with I no sorry I I confused it
[00:52:24] with images not Nam story um he's moving
[00:52:28] a little bit faster but it doesn't seem
[00:52:31] like this is working for him right now
[00:52:33] whether they move faster or not doesn't
[00:52:35] really matter so much because they will
[00:52:37] probably they will probably look at the
[00:52:40] names a second time anyway and use and
[00:52:43] use the entire time there as much as
[00:52:46] possible that probably might stop a few
[00:52:48] seconds early and there's Boris Conrad
[00:52:50] coming into the room he was he still has
[00:52:53] several Names World Records I think out
[00:52:55] of the traditional memory Sports in like
[00:52:58] like
[00:52:59] single um single what is what are your
[00:53:02] records bar National National names
[00:53:04] National names which is the the old
[00:53:08] event that we had before we came up with
[00:53:10] these crazy International names who are
[00:53:12] from all areas in the world so Boris
[00:53:14] Boris Conrad is is now with oh yanas in
[00:53:17] 59.8 seconds and in 60 seconds he
[00:53:21] stopped he stopped a bit earlier smart
[00:53:23] move very smart move he like are you
[00:53:26] scared for Germany right now yeah of
[00:53:27] course but they can come back he has
[00:53:28] shown it for example in last year's
[00:53:30] finals against yeah exactly yeah he came
[00:53:33] back but he was down 3-1 right he was
[00:53:35] down 3-1 and then I also picked names
[00:53:37] and thought okay that's my point and
[00:53:39] then he suddenly out of nowhere got like
[00:53:41] his personal best in names and beat me
[00:53:43] so he he has it in in him are you
[00:53:45] surprised about how well CeCe is doing
[00:53:48] uh yeah no not after yesterday not if
[00:53:51] you asked me two days before if she'll
[00:53:53] be winning third place I would not have
[00:53:54] expected that but yesterday she did
[00:53:56] really well and till now it's also
[00:53:58] looking really
[00:54:04] nice so it looks like for Johan's second
[00:54:08] name he put Brandy instead of Brandy he
[00:54:11] can fix that that's
[00:54:13] easy o for Robert he put
[00:54:18] George T is still on a good run so not
[00:54:21] many gifts
[00:54:23] yet so three three points for cece one
[00:54:27] point for Johannes this one is the match
[00:54:31] what do you call this match game place
[00:54:33] finish no but but this particular a
[00:54:36] match game set point um doesn't
[00:54:39] necessarily have to be the last one
[00:54:41] though but well let's see what johannas
[00:54:42] is pulling off you know no Dr Boris
[00:54:46] Conrad after this tournament are you
[00:54:48] just going to step away from these kind
[00:54:51] of events for a little bit and just
[00:54:53] relax H but just for a little bit just
[00:54:55] for a little bit when are you going to
[00:54:56] start training again
[00:54:58] um don't know maybe next week oh wow
[00:55:02] there will be the memorial event in
[00:55:04] Autumn and there will be maybe somewh TV
[00:55:06] work for me I like to perform my TV
[00:55:08] shows as well so um you you're probably
[00:55:10] the one who went on more TV shows with
[00:55:14] mind memory stuff than anyone else in
[00:55:16] the world is that is that true I think
[00:55:18] it's it for other people but actually
[00:55:20] actually it's easy it's easy to say
[00:55:22] because you're also the number one at
[00:55:24] the moment in competed in championships
[00:55:27] you probably have already surpassed Ben
[00:55:28] now I have yeah yeah have you
[00:55:31] counted traditional events like 45 if
[00:55:34] you add XMS and memor it's well over 50
[00:55:37] wow and don't forget the famous speed
[00:55:39] cards challenge that was I organized it
[00:55:42] so I didn't take part I right all right
[00:55:45] yeah um here now now we're on the stream
[00:55:47] here Boris this guy has competed at more
[00:55:51] memory championships any other world I
[00:55:54] need to hold my fingers
[00:55:55] yeah he's nervous right now it's so
[00:55:57] tight it's so tight so CeCe has 20 names
[00:55:59] right now and 17 he still has the last
[00:56:03] row open so I hope he just we have to 21
[00:56:07] she got four she has four
[00:56:10] names she knock him out right now names
[00:56:13] ahead of
[00:56:14] Johannes this
[00:56:17] is and Johannes doesn't really get any
[00:56:20] more points here right now he really
[00:56:22] needs six more names now and Cece's just
[00:56:28] cementing wow her lead there the
[00:56:30] youngest female in this tournament she's
[00:56:32] 15 years old and she could get third
[00:56:35] place if she wins this event look at
[00:56:37] this look at this that we are 45 seconds
[00:56:40] away of a sensation I mean honestly no
[00:56:43] one really has 24 now she has six names
[00:56:47] and she's so close to getting Maris this
[00:56:49] is she has gray for Gary our first
[00:56:53] female and our first Mongolian
[00:56:56] competitor on Place three at the xmt
[00:57:00] less than 25 seconds now oh yanana just
[00:57:04] got three more points can he do it but
[00:57:08] yet that's so little time he just needs
[00:57:10] to tie her just needs to tie
[00:57:13] her oh no 10 more
[00:57:16] seconds here we go the number one in the
[00:57:21] world is about to lose against set z b
[00:57:26] from Mongolia and it's over
[00:57:30] congratulations the young girl has shown
[00:57:34] the pro how it's being
[00:57:36] done wow amazing yeah Fant she really
[00:57:41] has earned that but you know what still
[00:57:43] fourth place is an incredible finish so
[00:57:45] congratulations yanas right of course he
[00:57:47] has higher hopes being the title
[00:57:49] defending uh competitor but of course
[00:57:52] also um it can be tough you know it from
[00:57:55] other sports like in a third place match
[00:57:57] if you're like focused only on the
[00:57:58] finals at the end of final it can be
[00:58:00] tough It's hard to go back energy in in
[00:58:02] the third place match and for cc of
[00:58:04] course it's a massive success already
[00:58:06] and maybe she just wors more into it
[00:58:08] than Han and that's what we saying we it
[00:58:11] looked like she was more into it during
[00:58:13] this tournament you could tell he he was
[00:58:16] doing this match like yeah during this

[01:20:06] is his full name well his first name
[01:20:10] right but we have a special guest with
[01:20:12] us right now the youngest competitor
[01:20:14] Everett Shu hello Everett you were huge
[01:20:17] surprise thank you good to meet you too
[01:20:19] you're huge surprise in this tournament
[01:20:21] and how do you feel after
[01:20:23] I feel pretty goodp days pretty good
[01:20:25] since I didn't expect to do so good I
[01:20:27] was just trying to get seven wins uh
[01:20:29] total on the first day and I ended up
[01:20:31] with nine so anything else was just
[01:20:34] icing on the cake and I managed to get
[01:20:36] three wins I was up 3-1 but um
[01:20:38] unfortunately I lost three in a row but
[01:20:40] that was was totally my fault I made
[01:20:42] some really dumb mistakes but hopefully
[01:20:44] next year I'll be a little better yeah
[01:20:47] versus P Germany all right we're switch
[01:20:50] versus
[01:20:51] Sweden
[01:20:54] why you wearing in
[01:20:55] Swedish okay versus
[01:20:58] Mongolia um what's that state here so
[01:21:02] first place the title extreme memory
[01:21:04] champion and $115,000 prize second place
[01:21:09] still not bad $110,000 as well also it's
[01:21:13] good to note that the top eight
[01:21:15] basically the people who made it uh to
[01:21:17] the quarterfinals all qualify to the
[01:21:21] next xmt
[01:21:24] next year's
[01:21:26] xmt and uh we will start with the first
[01:21:29] surprise event so keep in mind this is
[01:21:31] best of nine it's a bit extended than
[01:21:34] the original playoff matches so it'll be
[01:21:37] the first of Five Points and we will
[01:21:39] have two surprise events throughout this
[01:21:41] match the first one is for the first
[01:21:43] point we'll start with it and then we'll
[01:21:45] do it on the fourth point so however we
[01:21:49] get there um it could be 31 it could be
[01:21:51] 22 could be 4 z um but that fourth point
[01:21:55] we will do the second uh surprise event
[01:21:57] and then the rest of the points um will
[01:22:00] be decided by traditional
[01:22:04] play so without further Ado we will
[01:22:06] announce the surprise event there's no
[01:22:09] video for this one we'll explain it uh
[01:22:11] in person but there will be a sample
[01:22:13] that we'll show so you understand how it
[01:22:15] goes uh but before I announce what it is
[01:22:18] um this is going to be a
[01:22:21] partner um surprise event so
[01:22:26] understand understand so the finalist
[01:22:30] gets to choose a eliminated competitor
[01:22:33] to help them for this

[01:22:59] finalists um the the person helping
[01:23:02] doesn't get a prize but it's it's it's
[01:23:04] to help your fellow partner win right um
[01:23:09] so before we decide or we tell you what
[01:23:11] it is uh we're going to have you choose
[01:23:13] your partner um we'll draw a high card
[01:23:16] just to see who can choose first and
[01:23:18] we'll give you 30 seconds to choose your
[01:23:20] partner and then the other person can
[01:23:22] choose
[01:23:26] [Music]
[01:23:40] so Ace is a high card just so you know
[01:23:45] um so I haven't told you but you can
[01:23:48] choose a partner to help you he'll come
[01:23:51] out s well hold on hold on
[01:23:59] let's card to choose
[01:24:14] first what you
[01:24:16] got queen or the
[01:24:21] king I think they have different people
[01:24:23] in mind anyway so who would you like to
[01:24:31] choose how do
[01:24:33] feel that's a good
[01:24:35] [Applause]
[01:24:43] choice s it's good the
[01:24:51] come
[01:24:57] okay so we have Simon and Alex on one
[01:25:01] side and puj and S on the
[01:25:07] other so let me hand out what the rules
[01:25:10] are and we'll go over them
[01:25:21] together
[01:25:49] all right you may turn over your
[01:25:52] instruction
[01:26:00] sheets Hey Arthur I turn
[01:26:06] that so we'll have that up in a second
[01:26:09] but we'll start reading it so we it the
[01:26:11] event is called team numbers this is a
[01:26:13] partner event so you'll be asked to pick
[01:26:16] a partner which you've done already
[01:26:18] we'll give you four minutes of prep time
[01:26:20] we'll maybe move you to different sides
[01:26:22] of the room maybe one of you could go
[01:26:23] outside um to discuss amongst yourselves
[01:26:26] what you want to do your strategy the
[01:26:29] data will be 400 digits eight rows of 50
[01:26:33] digits will show a sample on the screen
[01:26:35] so you know it what it'll look like the
[01:26:37] memorization time will be 1 minute and
[01:26:40] the recall time will be sudden death
[01:26:42] verbal so each team will say one digit
[01:26:46] each the next team will say the next and
[01:26:48] we'll give you 15 seconds per
[01:26:51] answer so the specific rule so after
[01:26:53] part of the explanation is over
[01:26:55] competitors will get to choose their
[01:26:56] partner they ready chose their partner
[01:26:59] um skip that part after the explanation
[01:27:02] is over and everybody understands the
[01:27:04] competitor teams will get four minutes
[01:27:06] to strategize when they come back in the
[01:27:08] room there will be a 30 second prep time
[01:27:10] 10c countdown and the first person will
[01:27:14] or first team will save a first digit
[01:27:15] and we'll go on from there the 400
[01:27:18] digits will be shown on the projector
[01:27:19] screen competitors will turn around and
[01:27:21] study for 1
[01:27:23] minute after the one minute is up we
[01:27:26] will we will commence the recall highest
[01:27:28] card goes first or last they will get to
[01:27:30] choose and then from each round there uh
[01:27:34] well it's just sorry it's just first
[01:27:36] mistake loses uh each te each team must
[01:27:39] say the ensuing digit going back and
[01:27:41] forth it is sudden death so if a team
[01:27:43] makes a mistake the other team wins or
[01:27:45] the other finalist wins each team will
[01:27:47] have 15 seconds to give their answer
[01:27:49] they may confer with each other before
[01:27:51] giving a final answer but the finalist
[01:27:53] must give the
[01:27:59] answer so to sum it up you're memorizing
[01:28:02] a 400 digigit number as a team split
[01:28:05] that up however you want to do it um and
[01:28:07] when you'll be reciting that back and
[01:28:09] forth you guys can share information as
[01:28:12] you say your
[01:28:15] answers yeah as you guys
[01:28:21] understand
[01:28:23] let me show you an
[01:28:29] example have they started their time no
[01:28:31] no I'm going to show them an example
[01:28:35] first this is sample
[01:28:43] sample is that too big you want a bit
[01:28:46] smaller they can't see maybe the
[01:28:48] competitors can't see the bottom real
[01:28:51] well
[01:29:20] this
[01:29:34] lines 2 yeah sorry it's 16 lines of 25 I
[01:29:36] changed that
[01:29:38] [Music]
[01:29:39] 16
[01:29:50] 25
[01:30:06] come confirm
[01:30:13] bigger they're
[01:30:20] this
[01:30:30] two
[01:30:42] [Music]
[01:30:50] right
[01:30:54] you want slightly smaller but
[01:31:09] [Music]
[01:31:20] not
[01:31:46] numl
[01:31:50] numb
[01:32:21] in terms of recall we will be starting
[01:32:23] from the top left going row by
[01:32:32] row all right R good time this is your
[01:32:35] four minute four minute to strategy
[01:32:50] time
[01:33:09] so the finals just started and what a
[01:33:12] surprise it is the first surprise event
[01:33:15] and I'm blown out of the water right now
[01:33:17] because they get to pick someone to do
[01:33:21] the event with them each of these
[01:33:23] competitors yeah that's the first team
[01:33:25] event I've ever seen I think yeah yeah
[01:33:28] this is nuts so they I think very cool
[01:33:31] yeah I think uh Simon made a very wise
[01:33:34] choice and so
[01:33:35] didj very interesting because both both
[01:33:38] teams are very good at numbers so we'll
[01:33:39] see right what happens yeah yeah yeah
[01:33:42] Simon picked Alex the current world
[01:33:44] memory Champion breaks world record
[01:33:47] proved that he is amazing he at the xmt
[01:33:49] at so many records that going on and
[01:33:51] he's FR and um he had a chance to rest
[01:33:55] since yesterday so did sangi saman sangi
[01:33:58] is also the team partner of of puj so
[01:34:01] actually he you already said that
[01:34:03] earlier you think that might even be
[01:34:06] slight advantage that memorize the same
[01:34:08] thing yeah cuz they they might have the
[01:34:09] same system yes that might be a slight
[01:34:12] yeah yeah um okay okay they work
[01:34:15] together Simon has one image for every
[01:34:17] four digits but Alex has it for every
[01:34:18] three digits So eventually it could get
[01:34:20] a little bit confusing for them if they
[01:34:23] decide the same thing yeah right also
[01:34:25] they both they both speak Mongolian with
[01:34:27] each other and they can they can come up
[01:34:29] with a strategy that the other ones
[01:34:31] don't get and I don't know technically
[01:34:33] um when Alex and Simon do that they
[01:34:35] might have probably not they probably
[01:34:37] don't have any translation problem Simon
[01:34:40] speaks a fantastic English so who is the
[01:34:43] same system as Simon who should he have
[01:34:45] picked no one so no he he made his so
[01:34:47] his best choice was Alex yeah Simon
[01:34:50] Simon is the only only one using a
[01:34:53] 4digit system a true 4digit system
[01:34:55] 10,000 images 10,000 images right wow
[01:34:59] and remember guys to go to extreme
[01:35:01] memory challenge.com take the survey
[01:35:03] it's 5 to 10 minutes that's it all
[01:35:06] right so they are still discussing the
[01:35:10] strategy I
[01:35:12] think um how many digits are there
[01:35:14] there's four 400 digits look at that and
[01:35:17] they're pretty they're up close it's
[01:35:19] kind of hard to memorize those being
[01:35:20] that you know being like two feet away
[01:35:22] from the screen well yeah I mean the
[01:35:25] most the most problematic thing is
[01:35:27] probably that they're all
[01:35:29] equally um sized um to each other next
[01:35:33] to each other and in a in a traditional
[01:35:35] pen and paper Championship where these
[01:35:37] sheets look actually exactly like that
[01:35:39] you can you can draw lines according to
[01:35:42] your system and now you have to really
[01:35:44] make sure that your eyes stay where
[01:35:47] where they should stay you mustn't you
[01:35:49] mustn't make a mistake by going left and
[01:35:51] right that will it will not be a big
[01:35:52] problem but it will slow them down a
[01:35:54] little bit now if you win let's say you
[01:35:56] come in first or second place are you
[01:35:57] going to give a little money to uh your
[01:35:59] fellow teammate after this if they help
[01:36:01] you win this event yeah of course might
[01:36:04] as well
[01:36:05] yeah but yeah I think uh the hard part
[01:36:08] is that it's the first team to make one
[01:36:11] mistake loses so that like when they're
[01:36:13] doing the normal memorization of numbers
[01:36:15] they can always have some blanks and try
[01:36:16] to fill them in later but here there's
[01:36:18] no no room for any air so they'll
[01:36:20] probably be a little more think what do
[01:36:21] you think will be um a valuable I
[01:36:24] strategy there yeah I don't know I would
[01:36:26] say maybe 1 to
[01:36:28] 200 yeah it depends I I really don't
[01:36:31] know how both of them the same one to
[01:36:33] 200 yeah can you describe that gu so 1
[01:36:35] to 200 it's 400 numbers total I don't no
[01:36:38] one's going to do all 400 so we would
[01:36:40] have to pick a part so focus on 100 or
[01:36:43] 200 okay or they and both at the same
[01:36:45] time you're saying so both of them
[01:36:46] memorize the same thing so that they can
[01:36:48] discuss with each other I think that's
[01:36:50] the most safe strategy they were feeling
[01:36:51] risky they would have one person do some
[01:36:53] part and another person do the other
[01:36:55] part right but then you only have you
[01:36:56] can't confer with each other anymore so
[01:36:58] so what you saying is no one will
[01:37:00] probably do the first 200 one guy and
[01:37:03] the other 200 the other guy that's
[01:37:05] unlikely I don't think so yeah think
[01:37:07] most yeah most people do 100 digits in
[01:37:10] like 30 to 40 seconds so I don't think
[01:37:12] anyone will get through all 200 for
[01:37:14] their own so yeah it'll be interesting
[01:37:16] are you rooting for anyone I'm rooting
[01:37:18] for Alex and Simon just just because
[01:37:21] because I like Alex and he's cool he's
[01:37:24] from the US he's from the US yeah
[01:37:26] exactly all
[01:37:27] right okay you ever going to like
[01:37:30] practice with Alex or um I do ask him
[01:37:32] questions once in a while but maybe one
[01:37:34] someday he'll be my full-time coach or
[01:37:36] something I don't
[01:37:37] know great he is 10 years older than you
[01:37:40] yes he has a lot more experience too but
[01:37:42] I probably will maybe train a little bit
[01:37:44] with him once I start getting more
[01:37:45] serious into why did you get into this
[01:37:47] sport uh just because it sounded cool I
[01:37:50] think the first talk I heard the first
[01:37:52] thing the guy said was you can memorize
[01:37:53] a deck in of cards in five minutes if
[01:37:55] you just practice for two weeks or
[01:37:57] something so I was like what what on
[01:37:58] Earth that sounds like really really
[01:38:00] crazy and it would be so impressive so I
[01:38:02] tried to do it and I eventually got it I
[01:38:04] tried to keep it a secret from my family
[01:38:06] but eventually it just kind of leaked
[01:38:08] out and they were all my mom when I
[01:38:09] first told her she was like yeah yeah
[01:38:10] yeah and then when I finally did it
[01:38:12] she's like what are you doing so I mean
[01:38:14] yeah it was pretty it was pretty crazy
[01:38:16] but I think it was just that like wow
[01:38:18] factor it really got me going so I think
[01:38:20] that's how yeah most people most people
[01:38:23] do it so all right let see in Prem
[01:38:25] memorization right now
[01:38:31] mhm interesting um both Pui and S are
[01:38:36] varing the
[01:38:37] EMS Alex and Simon I bet Alex I can't
[01:38:41] get an up your accent I love it the uffs
[01:38:45] the ear muffs how do you say ear
[01:38:47] muffs not ear muffs but I like your
[01:38:50] accent right they always when you say
[01:38:53] that feel bad no don't feel
[01:38:57] bad now father told me he didn't like my
[01:39:00] German accent my British
[01:39:03] grandfather memorization Starts Now one
[01:39:08] minute
[01:39:11] wow I like this shot of
[01:39:14] Alex so now he's looking at the top left
[01:39:16] of the board the
[01:39:20] projector
[01:39:26] all right I mean this is really
[01:39:28] interesting also I mean you you really
[01:39:31] have to rely actually on this on this
[01:39:34] extra person now yeah Simon has to rely
[01:39:37] on
[01:39:37] Alex I'm sure sure it's a good pick and
[01:39:40] I'm sure Alex will do his best but
[01:39:42] nevertheless I mean it's it's all about
[01:39:44] Simon yeah and now
[01:39:46] Alex um he will probably not mess it up
[01:39:49] for him but he could he could yeah if he
[01:39:52] likes some then he won't I like this
[01:39:53] sort of idea I think maybe we should see
[01:39:55] more of it in the future memory Sports
[01:39:58] has always been individual yeah we have
[01:40:00] we have already many ideas for that Aver
[01:40:02] for many years and now now the
[01:40:04] International Association of of memory
[01:40:06] we will come up with new sports here we
[01:40:09] go guys team here comes the recall okay
[01:40:16] so turning around now facing the
[01:40:19] audience yeah I would guess they
[01:40:21] memorize the same thing we're going
[01:40:23] going in the room now yeah so good luck
[01:40:26] to
[01:40:27] those goodbye for
[01:40:49] now
[01:41:15] yep my car decides that you want to go
[01:41:18] first or
[01:41:19] second
[01:41:30] do you want to go first or second second
[01:41:32] you want to go second you will go first
[01:41:34] okay first mistake wins the other person
[01:41:37] does the other team does not have to get
[01:41:39] it right if that first person or team
[01:41:42] gets it wrong first mistake you're out
[01:41:44] are you judging yep so if you want to
[01:41:46] start you have 15 seconds for each digit
[01:41:49] so if you can take care of that that
[01:41:51] okay we start now two correct six
[01:41:56] correct six yes seven eight yes
[01:42:03] Z
[01:42:05] incorrect
[01:42:16] zero
[01:42:19] zero
[01:42:24] how far did you guys go just
[01:42:26] curious okay
[01:42:31] Shar all right Simon goes up one Z great
[01:42:46] job oh maybe Simon will share you
[01:42:49] know
[01:42:54] so now we continue as
[01:42:57] usual P J you get to choose what would
[01:43:00] you like to do
[01:43:02] [Music]
[01:43:11] numbers so it looks like the surprise
[01:43:14] event just ended and that was a surprise
[01:43:16] that was a surprise yeah exactly I mean
[01:43:19] as far as it looked we didn't really
[01:43:21] sort exactly the first digit was
[01:43:24] incorrect yeah he said one and it was
[01:43:26] actually zero that was um PJ said that
[01:43:29] and they lost so yeah Simon's up one-
[01:43:33] nothing yeah one point for Simon here um
[01:43:37] Alex uh sorry about that I mean sorry s
[01:43:41] the the idea was great though was a
[01:43:43] surprising one maybe it should have been
[01:43:44] two mistakes but I don't know I mean who
[01:43:48] could have known right could have known
[01:43:50] put pressure on them for sure though and
[01:43:52] it's funny too yeah actually that's it
[01:43:54] I'm sure Simon's having a good time
[01:43:56] right now I'm sure the the person who's
[01:43:57] most upset about this is Nelson who came
[01:43:59] up with this entire idea had this entire
[01:44:01] plan and now it it's over it's over
[01:44:03] before it even started well we know what
[01:44:05] the next surprise event is sort of going
[01:44:07] to be but interesting how they'll have
[01:44:09] them recall it yeah we have we have more
[01:44:11] surprises coming in so and here goes
[01:44:13] Simon with his
[01:44:16] usual pregame method yeah he's he's
[01:44:19] reciting his Memory Palace when he's
[01:44:22] using his fingers like that just kind of
[01:44:24] walking through it exactly um the
[01:44:28] difference what we have here now in the
[01:44:30] finals is it's best out of nine compared
[01:44:33] to all the matches that we saw before
[01:44:35] which were best out of seven so Simon
[01:44:37] needs four more
[01:44:38] wins and he is the champ be a tough very
[01:44:42] tough four wins it will be unlikely I
[01:44:44] guess
[01:44:45] that uh puj will make it much harder for
[01:44:48] him than that yeah well it does depend
[01:44:51] on the second surprise event you could
[01:44:53] definitely switch things up a lot like
[01:44:54] you did last year that's the first
[01:44:56] surprise event that Mongolians lost all
[01:44:59] right so they they picked
[01:45:01] numbers
[01:45:03] and Simon again with his famous four
[01:45:06] digigit system where he just puts one
[01:45:07] image on one
[01:45:09] location fast PJ with his Pao system
[01:45:13] there I think he has a p he was the only
[01:45:15] the only one who didn't answer our
[01:45:17] survey questions but his entire team
[01:45:20] ising s for very fast my girlfriend's a
[01:45:22] little confused by the surprise event so
[01:45:25] I'll have to explain that to her later I
[01:45:27] mean it was a little confusing a little
[01:45:29] yeah anyhow let us focus on this one now
[01:45:33] if Simon gets this he's a got a really
[01:45:35] big Advantage has Simon
[01:45:38] 2.85 seconds wow he had uh he clocked in
[01:45:42] at 16 yes two days ago but like three
[01:45:45] images so if he gets those very possible
[01:45:48] he could get all three and easily take
[01:45:50] take it now he's reviewing he's in his
[01:45:54] Palace yes BJ stops a little early
[01:45:57] interesting they that is interesting he
[01:45:59] doesn't need to do that well he's he
[01:46:01] hasn't messed up numbers ever this whole
[01:46:04] tournament so that's very impressive
[01:46:06] well the the the time that Simon has
[01:46:08] here that would be the second best time
[01:46:10] ever at an xmt I just think he looks
[01:46:13] cool look at them yeah especially the
[01:46:16] uffs yeah the E muffs I have the same
[01:46:19] ones they're really cool oh look at
[01:46:20] Simon all green right now starting from
[01:46:23] the bottom the problem is if Simon gets
[01:46:25] one blank that is very deadly well pu
[01:46:29] already one mistake yeah a six and he
[01:46:32] should have a two there it looks like he
[01:46:34] has a little they're both tied up right
[01:46:37] now oh
[01:46:38] Simon Simon probably has at least one or
[01:46:41] two
[01:46:42] blanks he's thinking right
[01:46:45] now Simon is Simon is always looking so
[01:46:48] happy when he does these things although
[01:46:51] I saw I saw I remember last year where
[01:46:53] he didn't look so happy against Boris
[01:46:55] Conrad anymore oh Boris Conrad screaming
[01:46:58] that was the first time actually I
[01:46:59] really saw Simon getting entirely red
[01:47:02] and breaking into sweat yeah yeah let's
[01:47:05] hope he doesn't do that now well or
[01:47:08] maybe maybe can you fill them
[01:47:11] in yep DJ's at 79 right now he just
[01:47:14] needs to fix that one
[01:47:16] number and he's not on it right now he's
[01:47:18] on the last number still well moment he
[01:47:20] doesn't even need to fix that one
[01:47:22] because has to recall all two images
[01:47:24] correctly we like Perfection floran well
[01:47:27] the thing is he hasn't messed up ever so
[01:47:29] I he should get the thing is the thing
[01:47:31] is it doesn't matter for puj Simon needs
[01:47:33] to be 100% correct
[01:47:36] or what puj will will win except when
[01:47:39] they of course tie with 79 but it's
[01:47:41] unlikely with Simon system it's 79 to 74
[01:47:44] it's in PJ's favor so what Simon just
[01:47:47] typed in here is interestingly far away
[01:47:50] from from his image to explain quickly
[01:47:52] what he does he has a actually has a
[01:47:54] three-digit system that he beefs up to a
[01:47:56] four-digit system by taking that image
[01:47:59] that he has three digit oh 78 to 79 now
[01:48:02] he's going back to those numbers he
[01:48:04] knows it he's he knows it exactly he one
[01:48:08] and he's going to win yep he just needs
[01:48:10] one it's always very impressive PJ is
[01:48:12] still at the last number so it looks
[01:48:13] like he might not change it yeah pu
[01:48:15] seems conf he's done yeah but I think it
[01:48:19] like I said will not make a difference
[01:48:21] if he changes and got a perfect 80 so
[01:48:24] it's all about all ice on Simon right
[01:48:26] now if he can get his correct image
[01:48:28] there impressive that he did find that
[01:48:30] image anyway
[01:48:32] it's Simon Simon is really good at that
[01:48:35] Simon always has this hinge of this
[01:48:37] feeling he describes us as a feeling
[01:48:39] that oh he just tied it up oh no no went
[01:48:41] back down tied it up again and now
[01:48:44] actually he okay now he's now now now I
[01:48:47] was incorrect but what I said earlier
[01:48:48] because he just fixed this one digit and
[01:48:51] now puj does need to get that he really
[01:48:53] need he's not going to change it though
[01:48:55] no he doesn't look he doesn't look like
[01:48:56] he's going to change anything there oh
[01:48:58] wait he switched it back Simon no but
[01:49:01] Simon is Simon is playing around there
[01:49:03] Simon will probably whatever he types in
[01:49:05] he might change it back and forth back
[01:49:07] and forth until the last few seconds he
[01:49:10] what he's doing there he's trying to get
[01:49:12] a feeling there he's testing out he's
[01:49:15] really going through all the ditches
[01:49:16] there and he wants to he wants to check
[01:49:18] his intuition
[01:49:20] his feeling did he see that did he see
[01:49:22] that image was it that what this is to
[01:49:25] do well he better
[01:49:27] stop 40 seconds left no
[01:49:31] 77 come on Simon you got to switch it 30
[01:49:35] seconds
[01:49:36] left he had the game oh 78 he's really
[01:49:40] feeling it out right now he knows it's
[01:49:42] in the
[01:49:44] 1,00 something 20 seconds left one what
[01:49:48] he need God go he got
[01:49:51] it but is he but is he confident about
[01:49:54] it or not really change it again in the
[01:49:56] last second hold back he's holding back
[01:49:58] oh he got it he's like oh yeah that
[01:50:00] could be right it's incorrect but
[01:50:02] nevertheless it's enough it's enough for
[01:50:04] him that is enough for him to win the
[01:50:05] home exactly Simon's up two nothing now
[01:50:08] incredible win wow look at it look at
[01:50:11] that and he is incredibly happy there
[01:50:14] yeah he's shouting out he's making he's
[01:50:17] pulling a Boris
[01:50:18] there s didn't well he knows his
[01:50:21] competitor is very strong and going up
[01:50:23] two nothing against him is winning the
[01:50:25] event that he chose was very big cuz now
[01:50:27] he can easily he's got a big Advantage
[01:50:29] here but look at puj he's he looks very
[01:50:32] puzzled he looks he doesn't look upset
[01:50:35] or anything he's like oh yeah man that
[01:50:37] was so close he's kind of smirking there
[01:50:40] again I like that a lot about him he's
[01:50:43] he's he's a very
[01:50:44] positive
[01:50:46] athlete all right so they pick cards now
[01:50:50] good choice by Simon you yeah well this
[01:50:53] is Sim's going through his method again
[01:50:55] cleaning it out we are seeing we're
[01:50:57] seeing the former world record actually
[01:51:00] still the world record holder in speed
[01:51:02] cards because um this this discipline is
[01:51:05] divided between the
[01:51:07] different the different championships
[01:51:09] which could probably be changed by us
[01:51:12] now because we are making all the rules
[01:51:13] now we know he's one of the top two card
[01:51:16] memorizers right exactly very yeah and
[01:51:19] and he is also able to go below 20
[01:51:22] seconds technically although he told me
[01:51:24] it's very difficult for him to do that
[01:51:26] and it's and the chances for him to get
[01:51:28] the a deck in under 20 seconds correct
[01:51:31] are very low so he he does he does more
[01:51:35] like a 22 seconds comfortable run um
[01:51:38] everything that goes below that would be
[01:51:39] too risky for very impressive Alex is so
[01:51:41] consistent you hit two out of three
[01:51:43] decks under exactly this this is super
[01:51:47] super
[01:51:48] rare
[01:51:50] yeah pu used a Pao I believe for cards
[01:51:53] as well right which is which is
[01:51:55] interesting that he's looking at the
[01:51:57] single cards here despite of his system
[01:51:59] where he technically puts three cards
[01:52:00] together but it it feels better for him
[01:52:03] obviously to to look at the single cards
[01:52:05] what I also find interesting that he
[01:52:08] looks like he'd be barely stops at the
[01:52:10] end of a Pio very close oh
[01:52:14] 2713 seconds for puj and Simon has
[01:52:18] 27.4
[01:52:21] I experienced that myself it was4 but
[01:52:24] because you see the blue light but you
[01:52:25] just don't have time to process that it
[01:52:27] means hey stop and go back so yeah so
[01:52:29] you think he saw it the blue light I
[01:52:32] yeah I saw it so close yeah when I had
[01:52:34] it it was point4 of a second and you
[01:52:36] have time to right stop but it's just
[01:52:38] hard to process with that but um that's
[01:52:41] a very fast time for puj he never gone
[01:52:43] under 30 seconds and got it correct yet
[01:52:46] look you know it that is that is really
[01:52:48] really bad for him when when saw the
[01:52:50] black the blue light right because it
[01:52:52] will
[01:52:53] immediately confuse him and he might
[01:52:56] have put fear in his heart I don't know
[01:52:59] I think he's pretty confident Simon is
[01:53:00] the most confident
[01:53:02] here but well actually P J is is really
[01:53:07] really going on par there with with how
[01:53:10] cool he is he's got a lot of lot of gaps
[01:53:13] early but on the other hand we saw puj
[01:53:15] losing a little bit of his temper
[01:53:17] yesterday when he was what match was
[01:53:20] that when when it when it got closer and
[01:53:23] closer for him um one of those let's
[01:53:26] let's go back and against Alex or it
[01:53:29] wasn't the one against johannas because
[01:53:31] he won that confident against against
[01:53:34] Alex I think it
[01:53:36] was do you start from the bottom um
[01:53:39] normally I fill in the bottom yeah just
[01:53:41] to get the last three images because
[01:53:43] most of us just when we're going fast we
[01:53:45] just read the last few images so we
[01:53:47] don't actually memorize them so you kind
[01:53:48] of want to fill them in first just to
[01:53:50] get them out of the way and then start
[01:53:51] from the beginning yeah but don't you
[01:53:53] memorize them when the time's up anyway
[01:53:56] you put them into a shortterm memory
[01:53:58] don't you put them onto a location I do
[01:54:00] I personally don't put them I just read
[01:54:01] the images and but it is important to
[01:54:04] get those last two cuz Lance few days
[01:54:06] ago he switched the very last card so
[01:54:10] Simon finished that is very very
[01:54:12] impressive almost no blinks for Simon at
[01:54:14] 27 that's still very fast speeds he just
[01:54:17] missed from beating him so if if gets
[01:54:20] the deck together Simon will lose anyway
[01:54:24] but he has a lot of gaps there that's
[01:54:26] quite a bit whole locations too and with
[01:54:29] his Pio system it is tricky when he has
[01:54:31] so many gaps cuz you have different so
[01:54:33] many possibilities for each yes exactly
[01:54:36] that's why I think yeah two card system
[01:54:37] got a big advantage in terms of filling
[01:54:39] in well it looks like he's doing pretty
[01:54:41] well right now oh he's getting cards
[01:54:43] left and two minutes of recall so it's
[01:54:47] in good
[01:54:48] shape
[01:54:51] [Music]
[01:54:54] so Everett
[01:54:56] how how intense is the xmt for your
[01:55:00] memory palaces because you have so many
[01:55:02] matches 15 on the first day and then
[01:55:05] more to come on the further you go into
[01:55:07] the competition it's not that it's not
[01:55:10] that bad because um what's good about
[01:55:12] the xmt events is that they're so short
[01:55:14] so the images fade really fast so I
[01:55:16] could actually use my palaces every day
[01:55:18] without having any ghost images or
[01:55:20] anything so I actually reused some from
[01:55:22] yesterday I'm sorry yesterday I used
[01:55:25] some from the previous day just because
[01:55:27] they were just completely clear so but I
[01:55:30] mean for longer events like for hour
[01:55:32] numbers and stuff you really can't use
[01:55:34] the same one in the same the next day or
[01:55:36] something so yeah I think it's it's not
[01:55:37] that bad just because we can reuse the
[01:55:40] Palaces and I can train like up to the
[01:55:42] day of just because I don't have to
[01:55:45] really worry about having ghost images
[01:55:47] so yeah it's it's not that bad for for
[01:55:50] me at least but I can always use more
[01:55:52] location I like that I like that name I
[01:55:54] never heard that before I've heard it
[01:55:55] from I don't know Joshua for's book
[01:55:57] apparently he they in the old days they
[01:55:59] would stop training like two weeks
[01:56:01] before just because they didn't want any
[01:56:02] ghost guys look at this 50 seconds left
[01:56:05] and puj just has 46 cards correct and I
[01:56:09] don't I don't think he'll be able to
[01:56:11] pull that'll be really impressive if he
[01:56:12] does if he loses he's down 3 and then
[01:56:16] with a surprise event coming up on the
[01:56:18] next yeah next
[01:56:26] match yeah less than 30 seconds just a
[01:56:29] little too fast for him seems like oh no
[01:56:31] he put the seven in where the nine
[01:56:33] should
[01:56:35] be he has 15 seconds left
[01:56:41] everyone looks like Simon's very good
[01:56:44] people in Mongolia are rooting for you
[01:56:46] he's got less than 10
[01:56:48] seconds it looks like Simon took this
[01:56:51] home yeah that's a point for Simon
[01:56:55] here and he gets it yeah the real oh big
[01:56:59] big pumping the fist into the
[01:57:03] air the German machine is a little off
[01:57:06] his game right now cuz probably that
[01:57:08] numberers R oh yes definitely R cuz he
[01:57:11] had never messed up up until then so
[01:57:14] it's true very and of course how quickly
[01:57:17] he lost that point in the surprise event
[01:57:19] also must have been something like where
[01:57:21] he's really annoyed about all right and
[01:57:24] like we know in in memory Sports every
[01:57:26] time you have something like that it
[01:57:28] creates so many hormones in your brain
[01:57:30] which are counterproductive for the
[01:57:32] memory process right so you really need
[01:57:34] to if you are in a spot like that what
[01:57:37] do you think could be a strategy to to
[01:57:41] come back it's tough he needs a really
[01:57:43] big win right here to get him going cuz
[01:57:45] I was down the I started off the first
[01:57:47] three matches of my day oh yeah I just
[01:57:50] got one so yeah you just got to get back
[01:57:52] into the mode and focus how do you do
[01:57:54] that what do you think is a good stry
[01:57:56] difficult you got to keep it keep it
[01:57:58] positive and from my what I've kind of
[01:58:01] heard like the more the pressure really
[01:58:03] gets to you when you feel like you don't
[01:58:05] have enough resources right to win so
[01:58:08] you got to know that you have all that
[01:58:10] it takes and all you have to do is get
[01:58:11] into a certain state of mind just to
[01:58:13] work cuz that's always I I always get it
[01:58:17] perfect if I'm in a certain Focus state
[01:58:19] so that's just what he needs I don't
[01:58:21] know how everyone does it differently
[01:58:22] but
[01:58:40] yeah okay you may turn over your
[01:58:48] sheets
[01:58:57] so as was announced um at
[01:59:01] [Music]
[01:59:02] orientation there was a 1,000 digit
[01:59:06] alpha
[01:59:07] numeric sequence that they had to Prem
[01:59:17] memorize and they should that memorized
[01:59:20] um I'll pull it up when we go through
[01:59:22] the recall um but basically competitor
[01:59:26] prep time is done they've Prem memorized
[01:59:28] it um the data is a th000 alpha numeric
[01:59:31] that means letters and numbers mixed
[01:59:34] together memorization time there is none
[01:59:36] it's Prem memorized and the recall time
[01:59:39] we will do like this it will be a best
[01:59:40] of five similar how we did it to the
[01:59:43] previous surprise event back and forth
[01:59:46] um sudden death for each point so this
[01:59:48] time it'll be best of five vers the
[01:59:50] three
[01:59:51] points so the
[01:59:53] rules um after the explanation is over
[01:59:55] we'll re reveal an example of what the
[01:59:58] test is the test may be different for
[02:00:01] each point so somehow we will be testing
[02:00:04] you on that thousand digit
[02:00:06] number once the test example is shown
[02:00:09] and explained we will draw cards to see
[02:00:11] who goes first similar to what we did in
[02:00:13] the previous one the order will then
[02:00:16] alternate each point so if you go first
[02:00:19] first point and the next point is the
[02:00:22] other competitor starting first and so
[02:00:24] on competitors will get 15 seconds once
[02:00:27] the F test is shown to give their
[02:00:30] answer first competitor to make a
[02:00:32] mistake or not say their answer in the
[02:00:34] 15 seconds loses that point and the
[02:00:36] first of three points
[02:00:40] wins yeah each time both of us get to
[02:00:44] answer the first one makes a mistake
[02:00:46] then it's over right as soon as a person
[02:00:48] says something wrong it's over it will
[02:00:50] always
[02:00:54] beut you mean who goes first
[02:00:57] or yes yes yes you'll
[02:01:02] you yeah
[02:01:06] exactly well in each each each round
[02:01:09] round not Point each round for example
[02:01:13] I'm Simon you go first the first time
[02:01:17] you go first
[02:01:20] second for the second point the second
[02:01:23] point you will go and then go back and
[02:01:26] forth whoever wins you will go and
[02:01:29] whoever wins you will go always back
[02:01:33] and based on the first
[02:01:48] time
[02:01:52] so we will show you an example we'll
[02:01:54] walk through
[02:02:02] it yeah so this is yeah this is actually
[02:02:05] the first point so as I said we may be
[02:02:07] asking you different questions about
[02:02:09] that thousand digits this is the first
[02:02:11] one but an example not the actual one so
[02:02:15] sample x y z prend yeah okay so
[02:02:20] basically what will happen is you will
[02:02:21] see something exactly like this you'll
[02:02:23] see a 10 digigit sequence a alpha
[02:02:26] numeric sequence in yellow which you'll
[02:02:28] have to locate in your mind of it's
[02:02:31] somewhere in the
[02:02:35] Thousand yep horizontal have to find the
[02:02:40] sequence from then on right we'll decide
[02:02:43] who goes first we're going to go up to
[02:02:46] 10 immediately after this sequence
[02:02:49] letters and numbers so whatever the 10
[02:02:51] digits Alpha numerics digits that come
[02:02:54] after these 10 we will start with the
[02:02:56] first the one that's immediately after
[02:03:00] say you're going first you would say
[02:03:01] this digit pu would say the next Simon
[02:03:04] pu and so on
[02:03:11] okay this is just an example because
[02:03:13] this is not a real sequence just xyz1 2
[02:03:17] 3 yeah it will syst is exactly the same
[02:03:24] y okay if you both make no errors we
[02:03:29] just continue that's it's Mark there's
[02:03:31] no points given time that they can
[02:03:33] recognize the sequence sequence can
[02:03:40] bewhere right yeah it's horizontally
[02:03:45] anywhere but it could start at the end
[02:03:48] of one line and go to the
[02:03:50] beginning so let's let's pull a card
[02:03:52] just get out
[02:04:04] way
[02:04:07] Jack
[02:04:09] 10 so you can decide you want to answer
[02:04:13] first this time or second you want to so
[02:04:16] he will start second I mean you go first
[02:04:19] this point but you will go first the
[02:04:21] next point and back and forth so would
[02:04:23] you
[02:04:24] stand we're going to put the and the
[02:04:27] recall will be done blindfolded after we
[02:04:30] show you the number we will give you 30
[02:04:33] seconds to look at this example okay you
[02:04:38] have 30 seconds to look and think and
[02:04:41] then blindfolds turn around and we'll
[02:04:47] say um
[02:04:50] understand and and for the recall just
[02:04:52] leave your blindfolds on turn around and
[02:04:55] we will begin with Simon saying the
[02:04:57] first of the next
[02:05:00] 10 P you understand
[02:05:05] okay that's
[02:05:07] good competitors are you ready audience
[02:05:10] you'll be able to see the sequence so
[02:05:12] obviously quiet please and you're okay
[02:05:15] with saying like x y one you can canel
[02:05:20] just question there were no o just just
[02:05:23] zeros right there were zeros and O's
[02:05:27] so
[02:05:33] zero perhaps I
[02:05:35] made shouldn't be that every C has
[02:05:40] like
[02:05:47] really
[02:05:50] I thought if you want to
[02:05:53] separate has no you're right I believe
[02:05:57] because we were trying to make them
[02:05:58] distinguish so we found a fun and I
[02:06:00] think we just replaced either zero or an
[02:06:03] o with zero repl zero and O with zero
[02:06:06] thanks for pointing
[02:06:08] that that's confusing that way
[02:06:11] anyways oh no o only
[02:06:17] zero
[02:06:19] just want to make sure we've had trouble
[02:06:21] with translation the
[02:06:23] past okay I'm going to scroll down and
[02:06:25] you will see basically the exact same
[02:06:28] thing but this time it will be real and
[02:06:30] braad will start the timer of 30 seconds
[02:06:33] you have 15 seconds each to answer so
[02:06:36] you have 30 seconds to M or to find it
[02:06:38] and then you have to come up with your
[02:06:40] answer each time in 15 seconds all right
[02:06:42] if you're ready we'll start in three 2
[02:06:46] one go

[02:08:16] sample this is the example so the same
[02:08:19] kind of question only we will be going
[02:08:22] for 20 in the SE sequence so we'll give
[02:08:26] you a 10 digigit
[02:08:28] chunk and you must go for a stretch of
[02:08:31] 20 between you back and and pu will be
[02:08:34] starting on this one you go first stay
[02:08:38] up so if you're ready I'll scroll down

[02:11:44] we'll give you a 10-digit sequ
[02:11:47] sequence and and it will be the 10
[02:11:49] digits before so Simon you're going
[02:11:51] first so you would say the first one
[02:11:53] before so we're going in reverse PJ you
[02:11:57] would say the second
[02:12:01] simonj the 10 digits before
[02:12:07] simonj so
[02:12:09] simonj Simon puj Simon
[02:12:15] Simon is that clear you each right down
[02:12:19] turn and say

[02:12:27] during you understand we're going
[02:12:31] backwards are you guys ready P ready all
[02:12:36] right timing starts 3 2
[02:12:39] 1 your timing Starts
[02:12:47] Now
[02:12:58] 15 seconds
[02:13:06] remain 5 Seconds
[02:13:11] remain stop please pick up your paper
[02:13:16] 10 you need to glance at your paper to
[02:13:20] write down put your blindfold on Simon
[02:13:23] please and you can glance if you need to
[02:13:26] okay we'll be starting with Simon we
[02:13:28] have the 10 digits that you saw we're
[02:13:30] starting from the one that's right
[02:13:33] before the start of what you saw what is
[02:13:35] that number or letter
[02:13:44] Simon quiet please the
[02:13:46] audience
[02:13:51] you have five
[02:13:52] seconds is a zero that is
[02:13:55] correct well
[02:13:57] [Applause]
[02:14:01] done it is your turn what is the next
[02:14:03] number or letter after zero write
[02:14:15] down you have five seconds
[02:14:20] C that is incorrect it is an
[02:14:23] L time goes up two to
[02:14:29] [Applause]
[02:14:32] one turn around so the next
[02:14:39] example so maybe they were too
[02:14:42] hard so we will take a 10 digigit
[02:14:45] sequence like before and you must recall
[02:14:48] only the
[02:14:50] letters so we will go for 20
[02:15:00] letters so again we're only looking at
[02:15:02] the letters we skip the numbers we'll
[02:15:05] only be reciting the letters you
[02:15:09] understand you have 30 seconds to find
[02:15:12] the sequence so important to note it's
[02:15:16] not necessarily 20 digits after after
[02:15:18] it's 20 letters after which may be more
[02:15:21] than 20 digits right this is more than
[02:15:24] 20 but we have up to 20
[02:15:30] letters you ready I'll show you the real
[02:15:34] uh the real test and then we'll have you
[02:15:37] 30 give you 30 seconds 3 2
[02:15:41] 1 your time starts
[02:15:46] now
[02:15:59] you have 15 seconds
[02:16:08] remaining 5
[02:16:13] seconds stop put your black on I'll hand
[02:16:16] the to
[02:16:20] face the
[02:16:23] audience all right this is brown we are
[02:16:26] starting with pu um since we're doing
[02:16:28] letters help uh we can write them down
[02:16:31] um your 15 seconds start
[02:16:35] now L that is
[02:16:41] correct your 15 seconds starts
[02:16:44] now that is correct P it's your
[02:16:51] turn W that is
[02:16:54] [Applause]
[02:16:56] correct Simon your

[02:17:21] you have five
[02:17:23] seconds that is incorrect is
[02:17:27] a all
[02:17:31] right so that ties it up 22 the next
[02:17:35] point will win since this is the last
[02:17:46] point
[02:17:53] for this last point we will go through
[02:17:58] all 1,000 starting from the beginning
[02:18:01] until someone makes a
[02:18:06] [Music]
[02:18:09] mistake pretty straightforward yes just
[02:18:11] from start until one of you mess up and
[02:18:15] Simon you will be the one beginning
[02:18:20] so there is no nothing to show you we
[02:18:22] can start uh when you're ready we'll
[02:18:24] give
[02:18:28] you we'll give you a 30 second moment to
[02:18:31] pull yourself together and then we'll
[02:18:33] begin
[02:18:34] okay your recall time starts
[02:18:46] now
[02:18:50] I'm sorry in 30
[02:18:52] seconds you have 15 seconds
[02:19:02] remaining you have 5 Seconds scroll
[02:19:08] Upson stop prepare for prepare for
[02:19:12] recall all right Sim we'll start with
[02:19:14] you what is the
[02:19:15] first zero that is correct puj T correct
[02:19:21] Simon three puj
[02:19:25] R can you write that
[02:19:31] down that is incorrect it is a p so the
[02:19:35] win goes to Simon congratulations he
[02:19:38] goes up
[02:19:40] [Applause]
[02:19:46] 40
[02:20:06] well we just finished with the surprise
[02:20:08] event and Simon just won so he's now at
[02:20:10] 4 nothing he needs one more win to take
[02:20:13] home the final and he'll get
[02:20:16] $15,000
[02:20:17] it was a crazy surprise event it's
[02:20:20] pretty tough because you know PJ has
[02:20:23] he's speaking another language and it's
[02:20:24] t to write it down he gets
[02:20:27] confused it's something I don't know it
[02:20:29] was a little iffy that kind of event for
[02:20:31] me yeah well I I like the event yeah I
[02:20:34] like I think it was a brilliant idea
[02:20:36] they had they had to memorize they had
[02:20:37] to memorize this beforehand they call it
[02:20:40] the the alpha long term they were handed
[02:20:43] out these cheets on the first day and
[02:20:46] they they could memorize these 1,000
[02:20:49] digits and letters throughout the last
[02:20:51] two days which is actually quite
[02:20:52] difficult because they were
[02:20:53] concentrating on the rest of the of the
[02:20:55] championship and they didn't even know
[02:20:57] if they if they go into the finals right
[02:20:59] and I talked with I talked with Simon
[02:21:01] and Johannes on the first evening and I
[02:21:04] asked him so are you go going to start
[02:21:06] this now and I said ah we don't know
[02:21:08] probably not because we don't know if we
[02:21:10] go to the finals and it would be a
[02:21:11] little bit um cocky and arrogant to
[02:21:14] already start
[02:21:15] now expecting that we will go into the
[02:21:18] finals actually an interesting thought
[02:21:20] of them very humble of them to say that
[02:21:22] but nevertheless like you said for puj
[02:21:25] it was it was especially tough because
[02:21:27] he had to do this verbal English recall
[02:21:30] and I think we we saw something there
[02:21:32] going on with the first recall he did
[02:21:33] where he lost his first point he said
[02:21:36] something it seemed to have been correct
[02:21:38] but he said it in the wrong way and
[02:21:41] super tough anyhow I mean what I really
[02:21:44] loved about this is that they Vari um
[02:21:47] going backwards going forwards leaving
[02:21:49] out the digits and the end even doing
[02:21:51] Rec yeah recall was very interesting I
[02:21:53] like how they had the the different
[02:21:55] formats not just start from the
[02:21:57] beginning on all of them so right
[02:21:59] exactly so so Everett what what do you
[02:22:02] think would be have would have been a a
[02:22:05] a perfect strategy for this one that'd
[02:22:07] be tough I would say you can't memorize
[02:22:09] all of them or at least if you are you
[02:22:11] got to know it very very thoroughly so
[02:22:14] whatever you can get down like if you
[02:22:16] did notice all of them were tested
[02:22:18] within like the first 500 so that makes
[02:22:21] sense it's logical but it's yeah you got
[02:22:23] to kind of strategize but I would say
[02:22:25] yeah one by one or 2 by two you can't
[02:22:27] put too many in one location CU you have
[02:22:28] to learn the sequence yeah and also you
[02:22:32] looks like they only made a past like
[02:22:33] three numbers for each surprise event so
[02:22:36] really you only need to memorize like
[02:22:38] five numbers or letters I mean letters
[02:22:40] yeah yeah almost everyone makes mistakes
[02:22:42] it's just because of the pressure even
[02:22:43] though they can May memorize like a
[02:22:45] whole 80 digit number and 15 does not
[02:22:47] mean you can recall it out loud without
[02:22:48] any mistakes so so was it was a great
[02:22:51] surprise Advantage just it was tough for
[02:22:53] PJ yeah yeah I I think it was a really
[02:22:55] good surprise event I loved it yes a lot
[02:22:58] and I will I'm certainly I will remember
[02:23:00] that one for a long time and I'm trying
[02:23:02] to think back of the other surprise
[02:23:03] events that we did over the years not
[02:23:05] all of them immediately stick in the
[02:23:07] memory but this one certainly is one
[02:23:10] that that was an interesting choice uh
[02:23:13] certainly certainly um somehow cooler
[02:23:17] the first one that the pick and not that
[02:23:18] it was a bad choice but how it turned
[02:23:20] out at the end right anyhow let us come
[02:23:23] back I mean this is incredibly difficult
[02:23:25] now puj is back 04 and could the
[02:23:30] greatest Simon only needs one more
[02:23:33] Point greatest comeback ever can happen
[02:23:36] today Wonder PJ cannot choose numbers or
[02:23:38] cards so he was have to do images for
[02:23:42] him most likely which is the most risky
[02:23:45] event yeah images
[02:23:48] so yeah let's see what's going on maybe
[02:23:50] the maybe the xmt is over in 5 minutes
[02:23:54] or it stretches for nearly an entire
[02:23:57] hour longer we don't know yeah see I
[02:24:00] believe in PJ so anything can happen I
[02:24:03] think he can win this one yeah he is
[02:24:06] incredibly good and he's the world
[02:24:08] junior memory Champion honestly I I'm
[02:24:11] crossing my fingers now for him not not
[02:24:14] in terms of for him to win but at least
[02:24:15] to get a couple more points to make this
[02:24:17] entire match longer and I I know he can
[02:24:20] do that oh yeah I now he can do that so
[02:24:23] we're going images here he has shown he
[02:24:25] can break the he could at least broke um
[02:24:29] the world the previous world record um
[02:24:32] which was super close to the current
[02:24:33] world record was 14 something you could
[02:24:36] definitely beat Simon here if he plays
[02:24:38] it right now this is this is really the
[02:24:41] the event that plays the most into his
[02:24:44] hands so let's see what's happening this
[02:24:46] is the one he got Alex on too so right
[02:24:48] exactly a lot of the top people do have
[02:24:50] some trouble with images cuz it is a
[02:24:52] little hard to prepare for well to say
[02:24:54] the least if
[02:24:56] puj pulls that off and and and wins no
[02:25:00] four matches in a row even that fifth
[02:25:02] one and
[02:25:03] wins that that will make him that will
[02:25:06] make him absolutely legendary even more
[02:25:08] than he already are you kidding me five
[02:25:09] in a row and any sport so let's let's
[02:25:12] see let's see I mean better than the
[02:25:14] Warriors they're already memorizing now
[02:25:17] come back I'm going back to the Red Sox
[02:25:19] Yankees oh yeah four in a row and now
[02:25:22] the and now you guys are talking again I
[02:25:23] have no idea what to talking about I
[02:25:25] don't even know what sports you're
[02:25:26] talking about oh here it is close 19
[02:25:30] just sees the blue screen just it looks
[02:25:32] like so yeah no so he's fighting for his
[02:25:35] life yeah did did you see that did you
[02:25:37] see that for how he hesit how Simon
[02:25:39] hesitated for a moment going back with
[02:25:41] these two images that was exactly the
[02:25:42] moment when we realized okay puj is done
[02:25:46] and and of course it puts also this this
[02:25:50] pressure on him I mean of course he can
[02:25:51] lean back now and and enjoy these extra
[02:25:55] 40 seconds that he has but he also knows
[02:25:57] that if if puj gets it he will um he
[02:26:01] will get the point and it's he also I
[02:26:03] probably he probably looked at the time
[02:26:05] and realized okay it's it's a fast time
[02:26:07] but not a super fast time for this guy
[02:26:09] he can really pull us off he did 19 he
[02:26:12] did 19.3 yesterday right that's
[02:26:14] absolutely incredible yeah so it will
[02:26:16] will put him it will put Simon in in
[02:26:20] under pressure and that's always a bad
[02:26:23] thing yeah in memory because he might
[02:26:26] make a mistake probably not but that's
[02:26:28] the first mistake coming in several
[02:26:32] ones yeah we saw Johanna switch two
[02:26:35] locations it looked like so PJ's all
[02:26:37] green right now yeah puj is very very
[02:26:39] solid consistent
[02:26:43] so I think he's going to win this I also
[02:26:45] think he's going to win this one I don't
[02:26:47] want this stand like this he needs to
[02:26:49] win it yeah exactly I don't want I don't
[02:26:51] want
[02:26:51] to to see pu just leaving the match
[02:26:56] completely with zero points but he is a
[02:26:59] mistake there but he's hesitating he's
[02:27:00] not continuing so he might Simon has one
[02:27:04] feel that something's off but on the
[02:27:07] other hand always when you have when you
[02:27:09] have gaps and when you hesitating there
[02:27:11] with images it's more difficult than
[02:27:13] with the others isn't it right yes but
[02:27:16] looks it looks pretty good there s's
[02:27:18] going to still just one one
[02:27:22] mistake Gap four that is that gap of
[02:27:25] four is very Simon got it right Simon
[02:27:28] got everything perfect so if pu is not
[02:27:32] finding this one mistake that he did
[02:27:34] there what is that a um a what is that
[02:27:38] flower called here I do not know ever
[02:27:40] it's it turn it turns into into this
[02:27:43] white thing that blows lion or something
[02:27:46] yeah exactly
[02:27:47] D yeah well he is under 2 minutes and 30
[02:27:51] seconds if he doesn't win this it's all
[02:27:53] over and we'll have to wait another year
[02:27:55] till extreme memory tournament
[02:27:58] 2017 we probably don't have to wait an
[02:28:01] entire year spoiler alert
[02:28:04] oh I hope
[02:28:07] so all right so still has that it's
[02:28:12] getting closer tension is rising ladies
[02:28:14] and gentlemen Simon's rubbing his
[02:28:15] mustache
[02:28:17] Simon is just waiting he just know he's
[02:28:20] going through the images again but he's
[02:28:22] waiting I mean this is cannot he cannot
[02:28:24] do anything puj looks good right now he
[02:28:26] just he just needs to see what puj is
[02:28:29] doing can't find his puj is not certain
[02:28:32] about these images he puts them he puts
[02:28:35] one by one into the right spots and then
[02:28:36] he's now this this little twist there
[02:28:39] this little twist of these two images he
[02:28:40] has one and a half minutes to figure
[02:28:42] this out those are completely different
[02:28:44] though I think he they're very different
[02:28:47] it's true a minute and a half that's
[02:28:48] that's that's beneficial for him but
[02:28:50] doesn't necessarily mean that he gets it
[02:28:52] he was very fast 19
[02:28:55] seconds woo it is tough 80 Seconds to
[02:28:59] go as it looks now in 75 seconds the xmt
[02:29:04] is over stop it don't say that it's not
[02:29:07] over yet it's not over yet exactly he
[02:29:09] can switch it but does he know where
[02:29:12] that little mistake is he had so many
[02:29:15] gaps there in the beginning came so far
[02:29:17] let's not end it here you have two more
[02:29:19] images let's do this 55 seconds left
[02:29:23] Simon's going to go crazy Simon looks
[02:29:26] like he's not going to touch his board
[02:29:27] he knows it's perfect 45 seconds
[02:29:32] left is this the final
[02:29:35] countdown yeah I don't what look look at
[02:29:38] look at the eyes of pu he's looking up
[02:29:40] and down up and he's looking at Simon
[02:29:42] and he looks at his own screen puj puj
[02:29:45] accepts his result that he doesn't
[02:29:47] really wow doesn't seem to concentrate
[02:29:50] 11 too much on his score he's trying
[02:29:52] he's trying to find out whether the
[02:29:54] Simon
[02:29:55] doing 20 seconds left he doesn't he
[02:29:58] doesn't play around oh he's switching
[02:30:00] something oh
[02:30:02] no that was the wrong one no no no he's
[02:30:06] back okay he's putting it back he's got
[02:30:08] 8 seconds more seconds he puts down his
[02:30:10] ear Ms he is done 5 Seconds To Go the
[02:30:13] xmt 2016 will have the same as the first

[02:34:42] hopefully more competitors uh to make
[02:34:45] this more interesting the St Stakes
[02:34:46] higher um we don't have anything as of

[02:34:57] exciting and you know we've done a great
[02:35:00] job here with our resources Dart has
[02:35:02] been amazing and um I think we've really

[02:35:09] what we
[02:35:10] have give a round of applause thank you
[02:35:14] there is
[02:35:17] but Mary you seen her around I think
[02:35:20] sheer remember so if you see Mary I mean
[02:35:24] she has helped so much um with
[02:35:27] communication between Simon and I and
[02:35:29] and dart as well as Steve deel who's
[02:35:32] right here if you could raise your hand
[02:35:34] he's been
[02:35:38] instrumental Linda as well I don't know
[02:35:40] where Linda is but she's probably around
[02:35:42] getting something organized She's Been
[02:35:44] instrumental to getting all the
[02:35:46] logistical thing set up also Jim and
[02:35:49] Arthur and and their crew I don't know
[02:35:51] where Jim is AR there they are yeah they
[02:35:54] set up all this technical stuff which I
[02:35:57] have no idea how to do but I better fig
[02:35:59] figure it out um and thank you again
[02:36:03] also a lot of you may not have been
[02:36:05] aware but we had a live stream going on
[02:36:07] so the viewers online got a completely
[02:36:09] different experience and we had these
[02:36:10] two announcers who I'm sure you saw
[02:36:13] which Max and Florian so we'd like to
[02:36:15] say thank you for for them for coming

[02:36:48] welcome that feedback this isn't a
[02:36:50] perfect competition but we'd like to

[02:37:05] should say Brad sidekick Brad and of
[02:37:08] course Simon who um put together this
[02:37:11] software which obviously without it we
[02:37:14] wouldn't have been able to play this
[02:37:17] match so he spent many
[02:37:20] hours most of them unpa but obviously
[02:37:24] he's passionate about it putting it
[02:37:25] together and um there's a lot of things
[02:37:27] that we want to improve with the

[02:38:15] and it is one of the definite highlights

[02:38:19] Perspective for the whole sport of
[02:38:21] memory and I mean I would be incredibly
[02:38:25] happy if this would happen next year too

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SESzcxAtU0

[00:00:08] [Music]
[00:00:14] all right we are back with the surprise
[00:00:16] event I was out of the room for a second
[00:00:19] did you pick up I was out of my mind for
[00:00:20] the second you were at the extreme a
[00:00:22] it's again we the Terri we are a
[00:00:24] terrible um no no no no no all right so
[00:00:27] we have it's a mix between images and I
[00:00:30] think numbers mix between images and so
[00:00:33] we're taking the um normal disciplines
[00:00:35] and we're putting them together that's
[00:00:37] incredible this this it's going to be
[00:00:39] hard but pretty I wow I think that would
[00:00:42] look cool not quite sure how they do
[00:00:44] that with the design but I'm sure that
[00:00:46] Simon Orton did an incredible job again
[00:00:48] he's always he's such a cool program
[00:00:50] everyone out there who has no idea um
[00:00:53] Simon Orton is always in the he's in the
[00:00:55] background but he shouldn't be in the
[00:00:56] background he's the programmer behind
[00:00:58] the extreme memory tournament he does
[00:01:00] this wonderful wonderful software that
[00:01:02] we use here and it's incredible also
[00:01:05] Simon uton is the several times memory
[00:01:09] Champion we have Katie and
[00:01:12] Simon table two that's a great matchup
[00:01:15] then Maro huge surprise for
[00:01:20] cc we have Alex against P um p p pvj oh
[00:01:26] my God PJ how did I miss that one that's
[00:01:29] that's correct
[00:01:31] yeah there people in back they're pretty
[00:01:34] nervous
[00:01:36] excited everyone seems to be ready it's
[00:01:39] the final eight right it's a combination
[00:01:42] of images and
[00:01:43] cards uh I'm just hearing here from
[00:01:46] Kevin from Germany yep writing me there
[00:01:48] thanks
[00:01:50] Kevin here we go Simon is getting ready
[00:01:53] he's
[00:01:55] pumped Alex you can tell he's sweating a
[00:01:57] little
[00:01:58] bit
[00:02:02] all right 15 seconds to go there look at
[00:02:04] the crowd and back they're all
[00:02:06] excited so this is again best out of
[00:02:09] seven like we saw in the um octo finals
[00:02:12] before so the first one who got four
[00:02:15] wins gets him to the semifinal come on
[00:02:18] Marlo come on
[00:02:23] Marlo and that's also an interesting
[00:02:25] information look at this look at this
[00:02:27] this is cool an interesting information
[00:02:28] from Constantine schoola
[00:02:30] um children World memory Champion he
[00:02:32] just wrote and that's absolutely correct
[00:02:34] those with a double card system they
[00:02:37] will have a problem now because this is
[00:02:38] just one card one image wow I'm
[00:02:41] absolutely correct this will to adjust
[00:02:44] and maybe go back in their mind to what
[00:02:45] they did years ago with a single card if
[00:02:47] they ever had one if they still remember
[00:02:49] it literally their mind's going to be
[00:02:51] like Mar is done 27 seconds zsi um TC 26
[00:02:55] seconds Simon 27 seconds Marvin P 26
[00:02:59] seconds so all all of them very super
[00:03:01] fast and at the same pretty much the
[00:03:03] same speed this looks beautiful look at
[00:03:05] this closeup images I would have
[00:03:09] probably took taken away that box around
[00:03:11] the cards though that's a little but
[00:03:13] that's really Irrelevant for everyone
[00:03:15] out there I'm just like a my designer
[00:03:18] eyes so yeah all right everyone else
[00:03:21] took 60 seconds Marlo took 6 live stream
[00:03:24] we have here all four streams and in the
[00:03:26] middle we have the camera I really love
[00:03:27] that let's let's have let's keep it like
[00:03:29] this for a moment there that's that's
[00:03:31] fantastic wow look at that recall
[00:03:36] so this is so hard I don't know how they
[00:03:39] do it so as it seems it wasn't really
[00:03:43] image card image card image card it was
[00:03:44] random so we had sometimes Double Image
[00:03:48] double card or there are even three
[00:03:49] cards there with Alex at the end so it's
[00:03:52] completely random he's killing
[00:03:56] it oh my God almost perfect he's nearly
[00:03:59] done oh a
[00:04:02] mistake he's going
[00:04:06] back and he first one to finish 26
[00:04:09] seconds against the world memory
[00:04:12] Champion number two in the world and is
[00:04:16] he the number two in the world actually
[00:04:17] yeah I think he surpassed Simon there in
[00:04:18] the world rankings not really important
[00:04:21] here for our xmt Championship there the
[00:04:23] world is much more boring than extreme
[00:04:26] memory tournament so this is the future
[00:04:29] yeah we must don't talking too much
[00:04:30] because we're still competing in these
[00:04:31] kinds of champion I'm organizing the Ed
[00:04:33] memory open next weekend in Los Angeles
[00:04:37] it will be one of those old pen and
[00:04:39] paper ones but let's concentrate here on
[00:04:42] the image that we see here
[00:04:44] froming Hest right now even though
[00:04:46] there's 2 minutes and 40 seconds left in
[00:04:49] the recall so Simon has several mistakes
[00:04:51] there already that's that doesn't look
[00:04:54] too good for him but who knows there's
[00:04:56] still two and a half minutes left KT has
[00:04:58] not done a single mistake yet but has a
[00:05:00] lot of omissions marn just beat johanes
[00:05:02] Marlo has a lot of omissions there as
[00:05:04] well and he already weaved in a mistake
[00:05:07] um CC has a couple of mistakes there so
[00:05:10] Marvin is done yeah fantastic job 27
[00:05:13] seconds yeah sorry I'm so concentrated
[00:05:15] on my own um visual income here all
[00:05:19] these screens and I mean what are we
[00:05:21] looking at here there are eight you're
[00:05:22] in heaven right now nine nine videos
[00:05:24] this your Super Bowl yeah this is like
[00:05:27] super multitasking right now and for
[00:05:29] everyone out there we have like this
[00:05:31] video we have this video on this one we
[00:05:33] see all this video it's
[00:05:36] like all right let's calm down and
[00:05:39] concentrate you're just talking to
[00:05:42] yourself yeah I was I was talking calm
[00:05:45] down I was talking of the um Royal we we
[00:05:49] yeah we you know my family is in in the
[00:05:53] books of Lords and Ladies of the United
[00:05:55] Kingdom strangely no way if like 100
[00:05:59] families and all their descendants are
[00:06:01] dying I will be the king of the really
[00:06:05] and my entire family needs to die as
[00:06:07] well and I would probably immediately
[00:06:08] say thank you though but no
[00:06:10] thanks so let's see maravin seems to win
[00:06:13] this one parafia seems to win this
[00:06:16] one could we get a closeup of uh
[00:06:19] Florian's face right now he's just in
[00:06:21] heaven no please don't do that I'm too
[00:06:23] concentrated here let's concentrate on
[00:06:25] the on the game because this one is
[00:06:27] super cool we have minute left in the
[00:06:28] rec honestly this although this is is a
[00:06:31] kind of an easy choice for a surprise
[00:06:33] event I really like it because it's a
[00:06:35] very straightforward it's not too easy
[00:06:37] there some people struggled yeah exactly
[00:06:39] and Constantine was absolutely right if
[00:06:41] you have a system that's not really but
[00:06:43] look Simon is winning the first event
[00:06:45] against Katie she's still got 40 seconds
[00:06:48] left yeah surpass him but he's got the
[00:06:51] time score he has a couple of mistakes
[00:06:54] that if she can cce's really struggling
[00:06:57] right now and Marlo is just barely
[00:07:00] beating her again here we go 25
[00:07:07] seconds now we got there's marwin he
[00:07:11] beat johanes the defending
[00:07:15] Champion right 10 seconds
[00:07:18] left now people are just putting in
[00:07:20] random cards right now oh CeCe with one
[00:07:22] more Marlo with another and it looks
[00:07:26] like Marlo beats CeCe in the first round
[00:07:28] and time stop
[00:07:29] and Simon beats Katie marwin beats
[00:07:32] Johannes and pjv crushes Alex really he
[00:07:36] really crushes him so much Alex didn't
[00:07:39] even get all the information together
[00:07:41] although he took 60 seconds to memorize
[00:07:43] this this isn't a this is a amazing
[00:07:46] result that we see here but hey it was
[00:07:48] just a surprise event now we're going
[00:07:50] back to the we're not surprised anymore
[00:07:52] we're going to the next
[00:07:54] yeah we we're not going back to back
[00:07:58] there we have
[00:08:00] Marlo just realizing that this is
[00:08:03] becoming a really good day for him so at
[00:08:06] the end of this do we get like a really
[00:08:07] big award B
[00:08:10] trophies uh the winner you mean yeah
[00:08:12] like a big trophy I don't know I know
[00:08:14] they had this this stereotype huge Shack
[00:08:18] that they hand out and okay um what we
[00:08:21] saw earlier were these medals but I
[00:08:23] don't think they have actually a cool
[00:08:25] trophy do they get rings they should get
[00:08:26] rings we don't have that really I mean
[00:08:30] of rings like an like an American
[00:08:32] football yeah that's that's an awesome a
[00:08:35] championship ring with the brain on it
[00:08:37] how do they how do they figure out the
[00:08:39] the the size of the fingers because if
[00:08:41] they would give me a finger look at my
[00:08:43] skinny fingers they would they just make
[00:08:45] a big one and then you can you bring it
[00:08:46] down arrange it at the next Jew jewelry
[00:08:50] yeah no that's a cool idea I really like
[00:08:52] that with the brain on it that'd be
[00:08:53] awesome yeah no I like it a brain ring
[00:08:57] brain ring oh my God that's really cool
[00:08:59] yeah you can turn in the Green Lantern
[00:09:00] okay so next round now um we have we
[00:09:04] have our The Losers of the first round
[00:09:07] picked now their choices for the first
[00:09:11] regular event here so we see CC picked
[00:09:15] images we're zooming out a PV job cuz he
[00:09:18] just crushed it Katy picked names there
[00:09:20] we go look at that pvv picked Cards
[00:09:24] Against the new
[00:09:28] no Alex the guy who broke so many
[00:09:32] records right and then Katie as well can
[00:09:35] Simon beat her joh pck words Simon's the
[00:09:40] 2014 Extreme memory Tournament champion
[00:09:44] so we have two Germans as the champions
[00:09:47] We need to take them down the Germans
[00:09:49] they got to go down we need someone else
[00:09:51] to win yeah I mean for for such a long
[00:09:54] time in the world rankings five out of
[00:09:56] 10 I think even at the moment six out of
[00:09:59] 10 were Germans yeah it's incredible and
[00:10:01] although I'm a German myself I don't
[00:10:03] really like that because the Sports
[00:10:05] needs to go in our directions and
[00:10:06] everyone needs to be honored there but
[00:10:08] of course if these guys are so good then
[00:10:11] they earn it on the other hand exactly
[00:10:12] you can't stop them now we just saw Alex
[00:10:15] he was sweating buckets and we start now
[00:10:18] there you go so here is Alex Mullen with
[00:10:21] his um neon yellow ear PLU and we have
[00:10:27] so many Graphics here my mind is blown
[00:10:30] this looks cool this looks so cool whoa
[00:10:34] and we're
[00:10:36] moving go I have the very same em ups by
[00:10:39] the way they're really good he's
[00:10:40] matching I like that exactly he's
[00:10:42] matching them with his look at that CC
[00:10:44] in
[00:10:46] 22.7 25 which is for him like a um super
[00:10:50] slow time yeah so I think he's tired
[00:10:53] today do you think so that he's tired no
[00:10:56] I don't think so either I think he saw
[00:10:59] the nightclub and no
[00:11:02] andana he's having some
[00:11:05] tequila so peria takes it slow of course
[00:11:09] like Malo who saw that CC did in 22
[00:11:13] seconds ktie and Simon both go through
[00:11:15] it oh look at this
[00:11:19] 56.72 against
[00:11:22] 56.74 Simon this is like the I mean
[00:11:25] honestly this is like 200th of a second
[00:11:28] and that is aming this will make a
[00:11:30] difference this will make a difference
[00:11:32] if Katie gets everything then she will
[00:11:34] win this and she has done it now so many
[00:11:36] times I think have we seen it from um
[00:11:39] from Simon yet let's have a look at the
[00:11:41] best scores did he get all the names yet
[00:11:43] at the xmt let's click on best scores
[00:11:47] click on names and no KD is the only one
[00:11:50] who got all 30 job I know he didn't not
[00:11:55] as long he did 60 seconds Alex did 25
[00:11:59] seconds but he's moving
[00:12:01] quickly by the way once more well done
[00:12:04] camera team here this is amazing this
[00:12:07] showing off of these four screens I
[00:12:09] think everyone out there really
[00:12:10] appreciates what we are seeing here this
[00:12:11] is a fantastic live stream image right
[00:12:14] now I'm super happy about this our group
[00:12:17] is just extreme so but on the other hand
[00:12:18] it's also a bit confusing because
[00:12:20] there's so much so let's let's see um
[00:12:23] CeCe looks good she hasn't done any
[00:12:25] mistakes yet I can't really see what's
[00:12:27] behind that little Edge there of the U
[00:12:29] Middle screamer that's fine let's keep
[00:12:30] it like it is oh cc is dominant in
[00:12:33] images Simon got well no Katie is doing
[00:12:37] her thing again where she's just typing
[00:12:39] in the first letter so let's wait for
[00:12:41] that we will see better results in about
[00:12:43] a minute exactly Pia have got everything
[00:12:46] she he's perfect there but um we don't
[00:12:48] know what Alex is doing he hasn't done
[00:12:50] any mistakes yet looks very confident
[00:12:52] I'm sure he will get it together Alex
[00:12:53] has taking this one home I think so too
[00:12:55] Alex will win this one very likely has
[00:12:58] two more double cards to type in one
[00:13:01] more double card to type in and Alex
[00:13:05] we're waiting on that King and that what
[00:13:07] is doing Marvin against Johannes Marvin
[00:13:10] is in the lead with 27 words against 22
[00:13:13] words and it was johannas pick wasn't it
[00:13:16] yeah but it doesn't mean anything
[00:13:17] johanes Johannes has the physical
[00:13:19] disadvantage through his um um through
[00:13:23] his through his disease that he had uh
[00:13:27] is it called a disease yeah degenerative
[00:13:29] muscle yeah it's a it's a it's a DN it's
[00:13:31] a genetic it's a genetic thing um what
[00:13:34] is it called you know what it's called
[00:13:36] it's um here one second I have it right
[00:13:38] here it's where the it's part of his
[00:13:40] muscles are um it's degenerative muscle
[00:13:45] um distrophy
[00:13:46] right but it has a it has a shorter
[00:13:49] version and he is actually um a
[00:13:52] forerunner in in the research for that
[00:13:54] and he was he was gathering Gathering
[00:13:56] money for the research of that it's a
[00:13:58] it's a very sad thing that's going on he
[00:14:01] cannot really so far do anything about
[00:14:04] that and it's degenerating his I think
[00:14:07] vertical mus yeah that's but that's why
[00:14:09] this event helps him out cuz it's all
[00:14:11] digital and he doesn't use his hands
[00:14:13] really with cards and moving it so what
[00:14:15] I was saying is when he is typing it
[00:14:17] takes him a little bit longer but he
[00:14:19] still can do that incredibly well so he
[00:14:22] was wheelchair B and look at this he's
[00:14:24] now in the lead 34 35 against 27 and
[00:14:27] Marvin is now lingering there at the 27
[00:14:29] doesn't look like he's he's taking this
[00:14:32] there uh Alex clearly got this one KD 26
[00:14:36] against Simon's 21 it doesn't look good
[00:14:38] for Simon there either and but just if
[00:14:41] people don't know what's going on CC CC
[00:14:43] and we got a graic out of it Well Done
[00:14:46] camera team so this is getting us a
[00:14:48] little better Glimpse at what's going on
[00:14:51] um this is Extreme although they're on
[00:14:54] the right side of the screen there's
[00:14:55] still a little Gap I probably you
[00:14:57] probably can move it a little bit more
[00:14:58] to to the right stop complaining no I'm
[00:15:00] just a perfectionist when it comes to
[00:15:02] these kind of things it looks awesome
[00:15:03] honestly 25 seconds left Alex just beat
[00:15:06] perv JV and johanes looks like he's
[00:15:10] gonna beat marwin and looks to look at
[00:15:12] Katie and Simon looks like Katie's
[00:15:15] taking this one home her her method
[00:15:17] always
[00:15:18] works by the way one more time if you
[00:15:21] want to tell us something shout out some
[00:15:24] some
[00:15:25] greetings questions I have food in
[00:15:27] between my teeth please tell me yeah you
[00:15:29] can do you can use the um Twitter
[00:15:31] Channel you can use the Facebook # xmt
[00:15:37] 2016 and you also can contact me
[00:15:40] directly on Facebook and write me a
[00:15:42] message I will see that here on my
[00:15:44] computer so yeah it's it we are now done
[00:15:49] with this round johannas has W Alex is W
[00:15:53] Katie has won everyone's clapping here
[00:15:55] we go and CeCe has won is just woo
[00:15:59] feeling it yeah honestly Marlo look at
[00:16:04] that smile my my guess my guess for
[00:16:06] Simon versus Katie is Katie Katie yeah I
[00:16:10] think she is so much on fire this year
[00:16:13] yeah Simon will have a super hard time
[00:16:16] to beat her although Simon is such an
[00:16:19] experienced memory athlete and they are
[00:16:21] both one-onone so it's it's a kind of
[00:16:24] a vague prediction that I'm doing here
[00:16:27] who knows it will be tough one I'm sure
[00:16:29] it will not be an easy win for either of
[00:16:32] all the two of them and back on the
[00:16:34] screen also remember go to extreme
[00:16:36] memory challenge.com once again extreme
[00:16:39] memory challenge.com take the test takes

[00:17:15] actually it's the other way around y HRI
[00:17:16] is behind the twiter feet I always
[00:17:17] confused those two sides so um how are
[00:17:21] you guys

[00:17:26] your brains are exhausted you're t
[00:17:29] yeah B when's your next event after this
[00:17:33] we all lost they all lost no no no I
[00:17:35] mean like when's your next
[00:17:36] tournament I didn't mean to hurt you
[00:17:38] guys I'm
[00:17:39] sorry none of you guys are coming to the
[00:17:41] US Open in a week I'm not maybe next
[00:17:45] event is next year's XT see have time to
[00:17:47] relax you're not going to anything else
[00:17:49] German memory championship for example
[00:17:51] or World memory Championship that the IM
[00:17:54] will host this year maybe maybe in India
[00:17:56] there's no date announced but um yeah
[00:17:59] yeah I'm pretty sure there will be more
[00:18:00] events so oh hey guys all right look at
[00:18:03] this cool scen that we have here there
[00:18:05] now we see um say hello to your friends
[00:18:07] and family everyone the next round is
[00:18:09] starting in 15 seconds we have cards for
[00:18:14] Marlo and Cece and Katie and Simon and
[00:18:17] we have names for paraf and Alex and
[00:18:19] images for Johannes and Marvin guys
[00:18:21] which one do you look forward to the
[00:18:23] most and and before you answer all of
[00:18:25] them are one against one point one point
[00:18:29] so this is really which one you guys
[00:18:31] looking at right now Alex Alex K and K
[00:18:35] and yeah that's another huge one
[00:18:38] so what do you think of Marlo still in
[00:18:40] it right now
[00:18:45] yeah wow johannas in 18
[00:18:49] seconds which is close to what he did
[00:18:52] before 17 he did and did everything
[00:18:54] correct I the record know that yeah but
[00:18:57] that's that's basically irrelevant right
[00:18:59] now there's Alex all about the
[00:19:02] point it's still faster than I would
[00:19:04] have thought he wins because Marvin
[00:19:06] hasn't shown any strengths of images so
[00:19:08] far so you think it's a risky move from
[00:19:11] johanes a bit right so Simon stopped at
[00:19:17] 45 seconds in cards look at this for him
[00:19:21] this is like super slow time yeah but he
[00:19:23] knew it's unlikely KT would go faster
[00:19:25] than that so so look at that did a huge
[00:19:29] speculation there basically that he will
[00:19:32] that KY will go for for absolutely
[00:19:34] secure time that people who do that then
[00:19:37] fail because you're so used to doing it
[00:19:39] in 28 seconds and suddenly 45 feels like
[00:19:41] something's wrong right it's going to
[00:19:43] keep getting like that every year and
[00:19:45] here we see CC did the 52 seconds this
[00:19:48] kind of thing that I predicted actually
[00:19:50] to see more often at the xmt this year
[00:19:52] so this is I think it's a very smart
[00:19:54] move of her just is like 7 and a half
[00:19:57] seconds off off the 60 seconds so she
[00:19:59] will still had
[00:20:01] a good second look at all these images
[00:20:04] although she's already putting in some
[00:20:06] mistakes there look at marwin he's he's
[00:20:08] going to get a perfect score right now
[00:20:11] right he took 60 seconds for the image
[00:20:12] if you take 60 seconds for images this
[00:20:14] is like pretty pretty pretty high
[00:20:17] percentage you'll get I so upset I
[00:20:20] couldn't do that surprising with images
[00:20:21] and cards because I have a one card
[00:20:23] system uh I used for so long so I'm
[00:20:25] really sure I could have beaten all that
[00:20:26] stupid times 26 in there
[00:20:29] easy to claim if you don't have to do it
[00:20:30] so
[00:20:31] that's but have l oh s s doist oh um CC
[00:20:37] made a couple mistakes right
[00:20:39] now yeah and there are more mes cards he
[00:20:43] always has a chance to fix that and
[00:20:45] Marlo is is really good at cards so I
[00:20:51] think taking that and also the fact that
[00:20:53] he took 60 seconds he will bring it
[00:20:56] together that he didn't stop the times
[00:20:58] Simon already
[00:20:59] won Simon already won yes I guess you
[00:21:02] also said that when I click images
[00:21:03] together so you never know right yes
[00:21:05] exactly we always must be careful one oh
[00:21:08] no he changed it back so that's that's
[00:21:10] wa What's Happening by the way I mean um
[00:21:12] what is what is your opinion
[00:21:14] about instinct when it comes to memory
[00:21:17] because what what my personal experience
[00:21:20] is I when I have an omission and a gap
[00:21:24] yeah I don't really remember what's
[00:21:25] going on but something pops up in my
[00:21:27] mind an image yeah in most cases this
[00:21:30] image is right but I don't trust it
[00:21:31] because it doesn't feel like right it
[00:21:35] doesn't feel right so then I try to
[00:21:36] start rationalizing it and as soon as I
[00:21:39] do that I'm getting I'm getting off
[00:21:41] track so when I trust my instinct it's
[00:21:43] right when I don't trust my instinct I'm
[00:21:45] weaving in a mistake at least in a
[00:21:48] pretty good accuracy I actually think
[00:21:50] it's true but today like I had that
[00:21:51] thought even when I clicked it together
[00:21:53] first correct and then I thought well no
[00:21:55] if you change it now it's against your
[00:21:56] first instinct so probably it's wrong
[00:21:58] but it felt so wrong seeing it like that
[00:21:59] that I my instinct I didn't change it
[00:22:02] yeah but that's not that's not Instinct
[00:22:04] anymore that's that's rationalizing your
[00:22:06] instinct popped up the Right image and
[00:22:08] then you start thinking here we go less
[00:22:10] than a minute and a half it's surprising
[00:22:13] Mara doesn't get it together in a minute
[00:22:15] but it might still be good enough but I
[00:22:16] think s say just shifted a of cards so
[00:22:19] if she realizes that she will jump ahead
[00:22:21] of Maro so Kitty struggling oh yeah
[00:22:23] she's taking off all the cards again she
[00:22:25] knows that she's off track there so time
[00:22:28] is she still has a minute but yeah but K
[00:22:32] Maro is not getting in more and more
[00:22:34] green cards looking at hnis now of
[00:22:36] course two blanks two cards so come on
[00:22:40] johanes TI up my teammates to get it of
[00:22:43] course Marvin Germans Marvin doesn't
[00:22:45] know what to say and Johannes is a 28
[00:22:48] looking at the last two images it's like
[00:22:50] 50/50 chance for him doesn't he doesn't
[00:22:52] show any emotion I love it and he's
[00:22:54] putting in wrong but he doesn't 40 40
[00:22:57] more seconds he might change
[00:22:59] it oh have something about Instinct and
[00:23:02] not changing it yeah but once you put
[00:23:06] the car the images in there it's really
[00:23:08] hard to to change them again because
[00:23:11] what if I yeah just did it what
[00:23:15] wrong if you knew the answer it would be
[00:23:17] so easy look no but but when it comes
[00:23:19] again to the Instinct thing well johanes
[00:23:22] might have already started rationalizing
[00:23:24] this look at Marlo he's taking it 10
[00:23:26] seconds left uh uh oh oh I think it's
[00:23:30] enough for him I think it's enough for
[00:23:32] him as well Marlo wins
[00:23:34] again wins Maro is such a surprise that
[00:23:38] this is amazing he's doing there this is
[00:23:41] for so this is now Maro goes into the
[00:23:44] lead two against one with against CC we
[00:23:47] have Simon goes into the lead against
[00:23:49] Katy with two against one we have Alex
[00:23:52] going into the lead against parafia for
[00:23:54] two against one and we have Marvin going
[00:23:55] into the lead against the reigning
[00:23:57] Champion johanes M really big lead I
[00:24:00] mean all the others it's like the here
[00:24:02] we go um the surprise winner winning
[00:24:04] again but now PF lost his kind of his
[00:24:07] pick that's like a break ATT tenis he
[00:24:09] might say so that's
[00:24:13] uh I don't know why he didn't get
[00:24:15] nervous against me to get nervous we're
[00:24:18] back on the stream come on show off your
[00:24:20] moves come back in Boris oh Boris so you
[00:24:23] were saying I want to learn more about
[00:24:26] what you're doing right now yeah
[00:24:28] right now while you're sipping on sure
[00:24:30] that's that's the right moment vanilla
[00:24:32] American noty is that what you're just
[00:24:34] sipping on right now it is no alcohol
[00:24:37] yet no thanks guys thank
[00:24:39] you where are you going to seats in the
[00:24:43] on the right at some inside just so I
[00:24:44] find you we'll find you back in a
[00:24:48] second all right what's your question
[00:24:51] then so you were talking about how any
[00:24:55] kind of brain can do this it's just
[00:24:56] really but what about training wise what
[00:25:00] are US what's the usual time for someone
[00:25:02] like a competition like this I mean we
[00:25:04] see people coming here um after just
[00:25:06] being into the sport for like two years
[00:25:08] like if you see ever he's just 15 and as
[00:25:10] far as I know he only started doing it
[00:25:12] two years back and already is like um he
[00:25:15] Al left now in the Run of 16 but um
[00:25:17] upsetting a lot of strong components and
[00:25:19] I mean we see Alex who is now like one
[00:25:21] of the big favorites C world champion
[00:25:23] they only started doing it three years
[00:25:24] back so um you can reach the level of
[00:25:26] the top here still rather quickly um in
[00:25:30] in my studies I also did a training
[00:25:32] study I had people train 6 weeks for 30
[00:25:34] minutes a day it's like nothing it's a
[00:25:35] bit of investment of time 6 weeks 30
[00:25:37] minutes a day for your brain or things
[00:25:39] that's might be worth it and that could
[00:25:41] lead them to double their performance in
[00:25:43] memorizing digits words names and the
[00:25:46] best in this field it was just regular
[00:25:47] students I offered like you get some
[00:25:49] money if you do this training with me
[00:25:51] and I can get to scan your brain before
[00:25:53] and after um sounds a bit creepy but if
[00:25:56] you're at a new science department
[00:25:58] that's okay um and the best ones like
[00:26:00] managed to go up to 100 digits correctly
[00:26:02] memorized in 5 minutes like of course
[00:26:04] they not yet at the pace that would be
[00:26:05] good enough but they only did it for six
[00:26:07] weeks and um there was one guy who then
[00:26:09] went on practicing and later even joined
[00:26:11] a beginners competition in Germany and
[00:26:12] memorized the whole deck of playing
[00:26:13] cards not in a minute is really the best
[00:26:15] in the world here but like in two
[00:26:16] minutes and um I'm pretty sure it's true
[00:26:20] for a lot I mean we had Melanie here
[00:26:21] she's kind of a student of mine um she
[00:26:24] saw me at a cup stacking competition I
[00:26:26] also love doing cup stacking and she
[00:26:28] also did it for many years and still
[00:26:29] does and she asked me just like if I
[00:26:31] have some advice for her for um how to
[00:26:33] improve her memory and it's also just
[00:26:35] like three years back and now she also
[00:26:37] was on this big TV show in Germany is
[00:26:38] competing here at the xmt in the top 24
[00:26:40] of the world and um that's what I'm
[00:26:42] saying like not everyone has of course
[00:26:44] the interest to become a memory of lead
[00:26:46] but if you have any interest in
[00:26:47] improving your memory that's certainly
[00:26:49] doable and for quite some people who do
[00:26:51] that the interest to then compete and it
[00:26:53] might spark later and that's that's a
[00:26:56] very interesting point because let's
[00:26:58] let's have a look at these at this
[00:26:59] multi-billion Dollar business that we
[00:27:01] have out there with these brain games
[00:27:04] like Lumosity and all these other brain
[00:27:07] apps that we have where you practice
[00:27:08] these little these little different
[00:27:11] games and and we look at our sport it
[00:27:13] looks kind of similar so what is the
[00:27:14] difference is there a difference is our
[00:27:16] sport actually beneficial for the brain
[00:27:19] and um what is the difference to these
[00:27:22] to these games that we see there out
[00:27:23] there in the the app stores I think it's
[00:27:25] a huge question that could give like an
[00:27:28] hour long talk about the short answer is
[00:27:29] these games actually are supposed to
[00:27:32] improve your working memory um by
[00:27:34] playing some games if that's true or not
[00:27:36] is still highly debated there are a lot
[00:27:38] of studies indicating it is true but
[00:27:39] many other studies saying it is not um
[00:27:42] but they all have in common that they're
[00:27:43] staying we train the working memory by
[00:27:45] that um do something for your
[00:27:47] intelligence with memory techniques you
[00:27:49] actually train something that's useful
[00:27:51] because it might not seem useful to
[00:27:52] memorize 80 digits in a minute but these
[00:27:54] techniques you can transfer to many
[00:27:55] things you can actually apply the
[00:27:56] techniques and still TR you working
[00:27:58] memory because it still all needs to go
[00:27:59] through there right maybe can use Assa
[00:28:01] after like matches there in the
[00:28:02] concentration phase so it's worth having
[00:28:04] a look what's happening here yep I hope
[00:28:05] we see the screens again and last thing
[00:28:07] when you're studying is there a lot of
[00:28:09] health benefits for this um I don't want
[00:28:13] to make any claims I can Rel back and I
[00:28:15] work with young healthy people so that's
[00:28:17] not not my expertise there's some
[00:28:19] studies out that say uh that say so um
[00:28:22] but again that's just a small field so
[00:28:24] um let's be a bit careful with yes not
[00:28:27] saying mhm and that's watch What's
[00:28:29] Happening Here words words words we're
[00:28:31] in the memorization right
[00:28:33] now Katie looks like she's really
[00:28:35] getting it done Simon's right behind
[00:28:38] her Johannes is going through it yeah
[00:28:43] Katie just like an upset if he doesn't
[00:28:44] get all 50
[00:28:47] right yeah it's it's the new standard
[00:28:50] isn't it for for her it is also did it
[00:28:53] johanes is finished in
[00:28:55] 3637 seconds
[00:28:57] johannas did
[00:28:59] it all
[00:29:01] right so Marvin's probably going to take
[00:29:03] all 60 seconds now and let's see Katie
[00:29:06] and Simon oh Simon just finished 51.88
[00:29:09] seconds Katie's going to take her time
[00:29:12] 58 51 what is the so that that would be
[00:29:16] a new world record if he gets it but he
[00:29:18] hasn't really shown even getting the
[00:29:20] fifth oh he did get the 5050 when was
[00:29:23] that I I missed that oh he was in the
[00:29:25] lead for a while like he KD did 50s and
[00:29:27] Simon 50 faster and then KD Simon after
[00:29:31] don't play with me guy right and that
[00:29:34] was probably done in early in the early
[00:29:36] morning yesterday maybe no was in the
[00:29:39] afternoon KT has the last wrong the last
[00:29:41] Red wrong I it's a surprise KD has a
[00:29:44] word wrong and I don't think she will
[00:29:46] get it because it's the last
[00:29:47] one can can you see it right here on the
[00:29:50] screen so I can yeah of
[00:29:52] course last word geography instead of
[00:29:55] biography wow you you picked it up
[00:29:57] incorrectly Simon coping her message
[00:29:59] wasn't wasn't it you who did Gira and a
[00:30:02] yeah yeah it was me it's just like I
[00:30:05] just said it that was giraffe and monkey
[00:30:07] in in English yeah but in German G
[00:30:09] enough and I just said it to myself and
[00:30:12] before I pictured it we giraff turned
[00:30:13] into
[00:30:15] monkey oh yeah there was and I picked an
[00:30:18] M the last words you just say yourself
[00:30:20] but KT already has a gap and the word
[00:30:22] wrong while Simon is still really going
[00:30:23] well so that's wow he's he's making he
[00:30:27] wants that very badly he wants that yeah
[00:30:31] yeah and that would be an upset for
[00:30:33] Katie so um not giving not winning the
[00:30:36] words against Simon that would
[00:30:38] be yeah I had an interesting talk
[00:30:40] yesterday with Simon and I was asking
[00:30:42] him about how he's doing and Performing
[00:30:44] and all these others are coming now up
[00:30:46] and does he still see his chances and I
[00:30:50] think I think he really
[00:30:52] sees he's going to get the that that he
[00:30:55] doesn't want to give up so easily that
[00:30:57] he has still all this power in him and
[00:31:00] and he wants to prove everyone that this
[00:31:02] is that he's still one of the best if
[00:31:05] not look at this look at the top right
[00:31:07] look at Simon he's going to break the
[00:31:08] record what's the record what did Katie
[00:31:10] do before let's see so she did it today
[00:31:12] like right she improved today was yeah
[00:31:16] it looks good for him he did what what
[00:31:17] he typed in so far as all good yeah it
[00:31:20] all the right
[00:31:23] so oh no look at this 15 number 15 he
[00:31:26] made a mistake and it's a it's a
[00:31:28] synon synonym kind of you go to best
[00:31:30] scores maybe for it was 53 seconds yeah
[00:31:33] but this was yesterday better today can
[00:31:34] you go on entire tournament on the top
[00:31:37] yeah so you can switch it 51 it's not
[00:31:40] Record She 51 51 also wow yeah her is
[00:31:44] 5132 isn't it 5131
[00:31:49] 31131 oh it's let see what the others
[00:31:51] are doing like I think s's actually
[00:31:53] getting this Mars Marlo's beating CC
[00:31:56] again
[00:32:10] so remember I'm telling me that it's
[00:32:12] actually an interesting mistake because
[00:32:14] he's a lawyer so one is one is a one is
[00:32:17] a verb and then oh oh wait wait wait oh
[00:32:20] he did
[00:32:22] it what do he do he knows like he he
[00:32:25] always tells he has this feeling if he
[00:32:27] it if it's right or wrong so he's not
[00:32:29] trying different words that mean
[00:32:31] something similar but he doesn't have
[00:32:32] the right one yet this is great we have
[00:32:33] the Z I never have that he says that he
[00:32:35] just like feels with his right he can
[00:32:36] see it and that it doesn't move right
[00:32:38] and for me that's yeah okay uh oh no no
[00:32:42] he's changing the other one too let's
[00:32:44] see how many maybe he gets more secure
[00:32:46] them will be less than that but ktie is
[00:32:48] not getting it
[00:32:50] together got Marvin Marvin just got h a
[00:32:53] perfect but johanes as well poor Jeff
[00:32:55] also got 49 oh look at this seconds CC
[00:32:58] took advantage and she's beating Marlo
[00:33:00] wow look at look 49 words
[00:33:03] P really showing off how fantastic he is
[00:33:08] I mean 49 I mean memor all 50 basically
[00:33:11] and even less of the time was such a
[00:33:14] difficult see him if he also just has a
[00:33:15] smelling mistake or something I mean
[00:33:17] it's Mongolian we can we probably can
[00:33:19] just guess exactly we cannot even read
[00:33:20] the letters it looks very similar it
[00:33:22] really looks like a spelling mistake
[00:33:23] it's just the last character we are
[00:33:25] finished so CC just beat Marlo 44 to39
[00:33:30] Simon beat Katie and prev JV just beat
[00:33:34] Alex that's Sim reactions there if you
[00:33:36] talk of my reactions was also
[00:33:38] interesting arogant but so that makes
[00:33:40] that makes CCE against Maro head tohe
[00:33:42] two against two we have Simon against
[00:33:44] Katy with Simon now in the lead with
[00:33:46] three against one if he wins one more
[00:33:48] that puts Simon into the semi finals
[00:33:51] Alex just tied it up no just tied it up
[00:33:54] with Alex Alex is not like M he is
[00:33:55] reacting his skin is yes yes exactly
[00:33:59] like you you can we can really always
[00:34:01] tell on the on the Flesh and yanes and
[00:34:04] marn are all tied up at
[00:34:07] two I would laugh to sit there now but
[00:34:09] it's also fun looking
[00:34:11] at can we can we zoom in on Katie I
[00:34:14] think she she also showing she's also
[00:34:16] yeah yeah she she doesn't look as steady
[00:34:20] as normally yeah I mean like to be
[00:34:22] honest Katie has this disciplines it's
[00:34:25] words and they toly amazing in but she
[00:34:27] it's like how you say coun to Faith in
[00:34:29] said the word it was digits and cards
[00:34:32] where in the whole field she's kind of
[00:34:33] at the bottom and now it's um she knew
[00:34:36] she she wants to beat Simon in advance
[00:34:39] she needs to win her words and names and
[00:34:41] U you can see it at her face she she's
[00:34:43] very upset she would have needed that
[00:34:44] point and it's close to over for her now
[00:34:46] like soim know has sweet shots and he
[00:34:48] can pick some look how confident Pia is
[00:34:51] it's unbelievable you cannot you cannot
[00:34:54] really tell's much of emotion going on
[00:34:56] in that probably is he's not a robot but
[00:35:00] unlike Alex where like you said it's
[00:35:02] clearly visible huh you you can't really
[00:35:06] say that he looks so cool and confident
[00:35:08] he looks so upset and puj even have this
[00:35:12] this this this little tiny smirk at the
[00:35:14] end of his of of his mouth there well it
[00:35:17] totally reminds me now P of like Alex at
[00:35:19] the last World Championships like just
[00:35:21] the young guy no one is expecting to win
[00:35:23] and it's just this one thing the
[00:35:25] expectations you might have yourself
[00:35:27] other people have to use it switch it
[00:35:34] around well that's really exciting let's
[00:35:36] see
[00:35:39] what's is still in there
[00:35:41] it's what are you it's like also I think
[00:35:45] like you talked about brains people
[00:35:46] often asked me like about what's about
[00:35:48] age is that only like the 21 year old
[00:35:50] win and we see some strong 21 years old
[00:35:52] in here four of these people here are
[00:35:54] older than me more 48 Simon is like 38
[00:35:58] um no he's 37 36 I think he's born in 79
[00:36:02] he's 1 year older than me no so that's
[00:36:04] 37 isn't that Hannis yeah well depends
[00:36:06] when exactly his birthday is so he might
[00:36:09] he's turning sorry I made him older then
[00:36:10] I say sorry for that but I saw Hannis
[00:36:12] already turned no yeah H is turning H
[00:36:15] turning 35 this year I'm 32 I'm turning
[00:36:18] 36 this year and I think Simon is stting
[00:36:21] 37 we're all this one here we go guys in
[00:36:24] between but still like it's not exactly
[00:36:26] so table one Cece and Marlo are doing
[00:36:28] names table two Simon and Katie are
[00:36:31] doing numbers Table Three Alex and pjv
[00:36:33] are doing numbers as well and Johannes
[00:36:36] and marwin are doing numbers too and
[00:36:38] this is putting Simon into a huge
[00:36:40] Advantage because he's so good at
[00:36:41] numbers and he's really pressing forward
[00:36:43] I'm sure he will stop now perb job at
[00:36:47] 22.7 challenging Alex now and look at
[00:36:49] table four and Simon stops at 28 KY will
[00:36:53] now really take it slow and repeat what
[00:36:58] you can do Marvin like it's this thing
[00:37:00] like I guess Marvin like4 seconds is
[00:37:03] just enough that you see it and cannot
[00:37:04] stop the finger anymore and it can just
[00:37:07] erase your last image because in the
[00:37:08] numbers you just say the last images to
[00:37:10] yourself and then instead of the last
[00:37:11] images you just see a blue flash it's
[00:37:13] like no on run on the other hand on the
[00:37:15] other hand he might he might not pick it
[00:37:16] up because it was so close together yeah
[00:37:18] that's what I if it's like 0.1 point2
[00:37:19] you don't pick it up but point four is
[00:37:21] just the moment when it comes up Marlo
[00:37:22] and CC are tied up they both did it in
[00:37:24] 60 seconds right now it names yeah but
[00:37:27] PF is really tring Alex I would love to
[00:37:28] see Alex now closer we see it on the
[00:37:31] screen and then maybe we can put it in
[00:37:34] for for everyone it's the model
[00:37:37] on let's
[00:37:41] see wow this is is looking like he he
[00:37:44] knows what he's doing look at the speed
[00:37:47] he sh shooting in these numbers
[00:37:50] wow W that would be wow that would be
[00:37:53] upsetting par that would be wow then he
[00:37:55] is really close and it's would be 3 to
[00:37:57] he already made a mistake
[00:37:59] there look at P he did it he did it wow
[00:38:03] wow sorry no you can say it no no I
[00:38:06] don't want to say it wow wow that's wow
[00:38:10] now he has two shots to G oh he's he's
[00:38:14] going into the lead against the world M
[00:38:16] champ think like after that he can the
[00:38:19] biggest upset right now wasn't it Alex
[00:38:21] look at Marlo he's beating CeCe but they
[00:38:24] have three minutes to go so some to go
[00:38:26] doesn't mean anything there yet Simon
[00:38:27] has a mistake wow Simon has a mistake
[00:38:30] was Simon but look look where he's
[00:38:32] lingering that's exactly the image where
[00:38:34] he's lingering and he has a four-digit
[00:38:36] system where he actually uses a
[00:38:37] three-digit image and then he starts to
[00:38:39] have a kind of a category adjustment
[00:38:42] making putting in the fourth digit so he
[00:38:44] already knows the correct images he has
[00:38:48] 7,35 that the correct one at 7,34 so
[00:38:52] he's not trying to figure out which one
[00:38:53] of this little adjustments in the
[00:38:54] category was usually if he has it wrong
[00:38:56] he doesn't get it anymore because it's
[00:38:57] different to he completely correctly
[00:39:00] described it and indifference to people
[00:39:02] who have he just switched that look
[00:39:04] right and he already jumped into a
[00:39:05] different one well recorrect that KY
[00:39:09] doesn't look like to be honest to get it
[00:39:10] together whatever Simon is do it would
[00:39:12] have been her big chance that would like
[00:39:14] then Simon would have struggled
[00:39:15] afterwards he would have gotten nervous
[00:39:16] if he failed this one so she's going to
[00:39:18] kick KY I mean he's going to kick K
[00:39:19] looks and look at Johannes and Marvin
[00:39:21] this is they're both struggling both
[00:39:24] both fast and both struggling joh just
[00:39:26] missing one image guys what did I tell
[00:39:27] you look at the last two memers of Marin
[00:39:29] yeah y just this moment you say and then
[00:39:32] just it's gone because it flash is blue
[00:39:35] it's amazing and this will this will not
[00:39:37] cost
[00:39:39] him too much he will lose one point they
[00:39:42] tied up can can anyone of you help me
[00:39:43] out I didn't didn't keep did Alex pick
[00:39:46] the digits or PF did Alex what Alex or
[00:39:48] PF who picked the digits let's see who
[00:39:51] selected to play
[00:39:53] digits Al Marlo is like see seems like
[00:39:56] he might actually go to the lead so
[00:39:59] three
[00:40:01] up I honestly don't know was who was
[00:40:04] winning who was if you type in search
[00:40:06] Alex and quarter then we can figure it
[00:40:13] out maybe the camera for for everyone
[00:40:15] could zoom in on on Alex I would love to
[00:40:17] see his reaction yeah me too let's zoom
[00:40:19] in on let's on the world champion
[00:40:23] there it's um so Alex lost this oh no
[00:40:27] Marlo
[00:40:28] again s wow it's what
[00:40:32] tough s is kiing what an exciting and
[00:40:36] Simon Simon is at the spot Simon is at
[00:40:39] the spot he's just just made it correct
[00:40:41] and now changed it back Sim just made it
[00:40:43] correct and changed it back whatever
[00:40:46] whatever he does it doesn't really
[00:40:47] matter because it feels so much better
[00:40:48] to win with a per score it feels so much
[00:40:51] better when this perfect score yanus is
[00:40:52] still struggling there he must he must
[00:40:54] have if he goes through a system he must
[00:40:55] have passed it because it's 02 so he
[00:40:57] should have had it immediately so right
[00:41:00] but whatever he does Marvin has too many
[00:41:03] omissions there and the time is taking
[00:41:05] out time is taking out's not getting
[00:41:07] that's forn up win for Simon let's see
[00:41:11] like the time is running up we have got
[00:41:12] Alex on the screen now don't change it
[00:41:14] back please please leave it on Alex
[00:41:16] thank you so much here we go zoom in on
[00:41:18] Alex's face and both of them I also want
[00:41:19] to see if P I want to I want to see both
[00:41:21] of them don't Zoom inia no no I want to
[00:41:24] see go back go back go back go back go
[00:41:25] back go back go back go back we will see
[00:41:28] him oh we're now Frozen he has reactions
[00:41:32] he has emotions wow wow yeah he just bet
[00:41:36] the world memory Champion his confidence
[00:41:39] he's not through yet but yeah that's I
[00:41:40] think that's the most impressive one
[00:41:42] about about him he is now we see Alex
[00:41:44] and I see if it's oh wow is turning
[00:41:47] purple this red is turning purple give
[00:41:50] very
[00:41:52] rashy wow I honestly I don't know when I
[00:41:56] should ever improve in the sport to to
[00:41:58] to make it into the xmt I'm not sure if
[00:42:01] it can take the pressure but guys let's
[00:42:02] talk about Katie she just was eliminated
[00:42:04] but she had an incredible tournament
[00:42:06] congratulations to Katie she was she was
[00:42:09] so good she was so good she broke
[00:42:10] several World Records she broke her own
[00:42:12] records several times she broke the the
[00:42:14] the the words records I think three
[00:42:16] times at least oh did you see pjv couple
[00:42:20] of fist pumps right at
[00:42:22] him wow in his face did he yeah
[00:42:27] he
[00:42:27] did because he knows he has he has one
[00:42:31] chance to pick his his good event and um
[00:42:35] oh cards he picked cards Alex of course
[00:42:37] Alex picked cards but um oh he's like
[00:42:40] I'm picking cards let's
[00:42:42] go It's the final countdown which I
[00:42:44] thought he's up to pick but he's not yet
[00:42:46] no but after that he is and then he can
[00:42:48] pick his strongest event I still think
[00:42:51] Alex is going to come out winning isn't
[00:42:53] it did what did he start can you can you
[00:42:55] have a look
[00:42:57] can you try quarter Alex let me see like
[00:43:01] he he picked uh names names actually wow
[00:43:05] that's interesting it was an interesting
[00:43:06] pick so P have picked names and lost it
[00:43:09] so that's interesting guys in
[00:43:12] uh couple minutes is lunchtime too it's
[00:43:16] pretty ex we finish these first we
[00:43:19] finish yeah so who cares about food Imes
[00:43:23] for M images for M and words for hes
[00:43:27] hus is in the lead so he should be the
[00:43:29] favorite in words so that might be the
[00:43:31] good boy for Marin but don't say it too
[00:43:33] early
[00:43:35] ween Marlo is ready same with
[00:43:44] Marlin Maro it sounds they sound so
[00:43:47] similar Maro Malo
[00:43:50] Marin TI and and Malin Malo Malin Malo
[00:43:55] Malo Mal
[00:43:56] Marin you have to say it very fast
[00:43:59] everyone's ready to
[00:44:01] go so s is in images really strong hus
[00:44:05] in words so both of them are three to
[00:44:07] ahead and no kind of the big favorites
[00:44:10] in their matches but PF against al
[00:44:12] that's the most amazing for sure can we
[00:44:15] move in the um the for streams together
[00:44:18] again because now we don't have that
[00:44:20] Central image we have a big screen on
[00:44:22] the top you don't have a force one
[00:44:23] anymore it's good like this no I like
[00:44:27] that that you have that X in the middle
[00:44:30] yeah that's
[00:44:31] nice the X from the xmt in the
[00:44:34] middle and
[00:44:36] Rec I want to see what Alex does p is
[00:44:39] also going fast like cc is going fast
[00:44:42] too they all very look at P speed he's
[00:44:44] faster much faster than Alex he wants to
[00:44:46] upset Alex with a single image system
[00:44:48] with a single that helped him so much
[00:44:50] into in the first task in Surprise event
[00:44:52] if you have a single card system it look
[00:44:54] he's faster no Alex is creeping up on
[00:44:57] him question is if he does he press or
[00:44:59] does he
[00:45:01] review
[00:45:04] oh well Alex is taking his time yeah now
[00:45:07] of course now he saw the blue screen
[00:45:09] with he doesn't have still like he took
[00:45:11] his time before I think Alex is upset
[00:45:13] right now cuz he could have done it a
[00:45:14] lot faster than 25 seconds that was
[00:45:16] exactly what P wanted of course thing is
[00:45:19] like pu seems really confident but can
[00:45:22] he get 25 seconds I don't think he got
[00:45:23] anything close to that yet look at CC
[00:45:26] she's in at 19.25 for images and Marlo's
[00:45:29] just going to review yeah CCE she did
[00:45:31] like the images in 14 seconds on day one
[00:45:33] so that's certainly in her range yeah
[00:45:34] the best the best time from PJ was 33
[00:45:38] seconds that's a huge difference 8
[00:45:40] seconds faster but we have seen him
[00:45:41] doing that close to that at least before
[00:45:44] in the uh traditional longer
[00:45:45] championships didn't he under 30 seconds
[00:45:48] at least I'm not quite sure about the 25
[00:45:50] though um I I certainly think he can do
[00:45:53] it otherwise he wouldn't have go for
[00:45:55] such such a time that I'm not sure and
[00:45:58] comparing like Alex stress level to to
[00:46:00] my own like I wouldn't even be surprised
[00:46:02] if Alex fails just by taking a minute
[00:46:04] like you think how can it be that a guy
[00:46:06] who who can do it like in 16 seconds
[00:46:07] suddenly can't do it in in 30 anymore um
[00:46:10] but stress course it's it's what's
[00:46:13] happening with all these some gaps there
[00:46:16] left some gaps so I was talking to FL
[00:46:18] about this and there's even a mistake
[00:46:20] now I was trying to for about C made a
[00:46:22] mistake also wow it's Maro has a chance
[00:46:26] what were you talking with me about uh
[00:46:28] meditation cuz it seems like Alex needs
[00:46:30] some oh right we were interrupting about
[00:46:32] this one actually we didn't really come
[00:46:33] to a conclusion that I think that in the
[00:46:35] future when this is all getting crazy
[00:46:37] and crazy and better and better
[00:46:38] performances and more and more money
[00:46:40] people need to really adjust their
[00:46:41] training and um get everything together
[00:46:45] meditation Health you see some wrong
[00:46:47] cards PF has some wrong cards
[00:46:50] in here Some Cuts in Alex do get it
[00:46:53] together in this minute it looks like
[00:46:55] and C also put one image wrong no she's
[00:46:58] she found it she found yeah she found
[00:47:00] it cool wow CeCe just knocked out Marlo
[00:47:04] if she doesn't change it back like some
[00:47:06] weird people do she will be this this
[00:47:08] will this will put her into the seminal
[00:47:11] h g the location in the words that could
[00:47:14] be Marvin's big chance just but Marvin
[00:47:16] doesn't really look well what he's doing
[00:47:18] there either he also he also moved wow W
[00:47:20] he just have five points so far because
[00:47:22] everything he wrote a lot of words but
[00:47:23] if he he can move it around
[00:47:26] left wow you look it yeah Alex is done
[00:47:29] Alex is done P yes some wrong
[00:47:33] cards do you want the upset H moved it
[00:47:37] by one and Marvin moved it by two so
[00:47:39] Forest do you want the upset by
[00:47:42] perv if I want it do you want it do you
[00:47:45] want pre to beat Alex Oh I really don't
[00:47:49] have any pref they both deser it's they
[00:47:51] are both amazing competitors and um the
[00:47:54] political answer no it's it's true and
[00:47:56] like I mean like I have more contact
[00:47:57] with Alex so I feel a little little more
[00:48:00] emotional for Alex and hope that he can
[00:48:02] go through and think as world champion
[00:48:04] then it would be amazing to see if he
[00:48:07] can go through it look at him look at
[00:48:10] him he know yeah oh no he's just hoping
[00:48:14] hoping hoping please make a mistake 90
[00:48:16] seconds left Alex can just help P made a
[00:48:18] mistake oh what's going on with johanes
[00:48:20] and Marvin they just like like
[00:48:23] completely messed upan can knock out
[00:48:25] Marin right now but they're head tohe
[00:48:27] head they're 15 14 and joh is johanes is
[00:48:30] really off by by one the question is if
[00:48:32] he finishes this block he should realize
[00:48:34] there's one missing and and now Marvin
[00:48:36] is really Rec correcting everything he's
[00:48:37] going up up up up up up up up he gets
[00:48:41] looks looks like Marvin is going one
[00:48:44] minut left but 60 seconds left exactly
[00:48:47] and it doesn't look like FF is going to
[00:48:48] make any changes no he looks he looks
[00:48:50] like he did everything right he thinks
[00:48:53] that he did did no no not anymore no
[00:48:55] he's in his head okay I recorrect myself
[00:48:58] his head swinging backwards indicates
[00:49:00] the must not realized he missed the
[00:49:02] location wish he only has 45 seconds
[00:49:05] left does he realize it Marvin realized
[00:49:06] it so he's getting his H hus can
[00:49:08] actually make this with one click one
[00:49:10] one click one minus click Alex is pretty
[00:49:12] lucky right
[00:49:13] now yeah there he is look at his hand
[00:49:16] from Johannes he's really like what what
[00:49:17] what's going on here if he finds the
[00:49:20] location and he clicks the right thing
[00:49:23] question if he clicks go semifinal if he
[00:49:25] clicks the plus button he will throw out
[00:49:27] the last row it it might it might
[00:49:29] actually decide in the last second he's
[00:49:31] clicking something he's clicking
[00:49:32] something he he knows he knows exactly
[00:49:34] he just looks for that spot don't don't
[00:49:38] yeah yeah he's moving it he's moving it
[00:49:40] he moved it fast enough yeah just moved
[00:49:43] it there it is wow oh my God oh my God
[00:49:46] and it throws Marvin out and my
[00:49:48] prediction um is jumping on look at's
[00:49:51] reaction wow last second and Alex just
[00:49:53] beat pev JV too so this is look look at
[00:49:57] puf look at puf now he is sh he is
[00:49:59] reacting now wow I I want to I want to
[00:50:03] run into the room again but I run in no
[00:50:06] no no no no I stay here I want to his
[00:50:08] team I want to see what's happening with
[00:50:10] paraf and Al teamates I can congratulate
[00:50:13] oh yeah look at this pep talk right now
[00:50:15] yeah yeah there's Marlo congratulations
[00:50:17] to Marlo well but congratulations to to
[00:50:20] sayy wow do you know do you know how old
[00:50:22] she is I have it somewhere here in my
[00:50:24] emails
[00:50:26] isn't she 16 let me let me try to find
[00:50:29] the survey that she answered for me I
[00:50:32] got it but I didn't put it on our
[00:50:36] cards so we have one more game to play
[00:50:39] Al and let's see what P picks he picked
[00:50:42] names before and the Alex one is he now
[00:50:44] confident enough to say I go for names
[00:50:46] he's look he's Consulting with his
[00:50:47] teammates is that even legal I think it
[00:50:49] is it's not helping
[00:50:51] before so he has to make his pick now
[00:50:53] but it's weird that they're sitting kind
[00:50:55] of in front of him feel like that's
[00:51:04] distracting no we can't have the full in
[00:51:06] zoom on that match I know like Alex
[00:51:09] family is doing some watching at home U
[00:51:13] they posted some nice photos of it
[00:51:14] they're watching right now I must say
[00:51:16] pretty sure they do although my predic
[00:51:18] family back in Mongolia I don't know
[00:51:19] what time it is I was there like in the
[00:51:21] middle of the night probably they
[00:51:23] watching as well of course this this was
[00:51:26] the most satisfying thing for me to see
[00:51:29] that my prediction was incorrect that it
[00:51:30] was incorrect because johanes bet him
[00:51:32] because man we are so we are friends for
[00:51:34] forever and I'm sorry for Marvin but I'm
[00:51:38] very very happy for for johanes and that
[00:51:40] he did in the last second that was
[00:51:41] amazing I mean honestly this is this is
[00:51:44] what the xmt makes so great and we are
[00:51:46] sitting here and we are cheering because
[00:51:48] of this last moment thing that people
[00:51:51] change something that was incredible
[00:51:52] last you will never have that in the
[00:51:54] traditional championships at least not
[00:51:55] as they are in the at the
[00:51:58] moment so what does he pick what does he
[00:52:00] pick by the way um Cece's birthday is in
[00:52:06] 2000 Simon Simon big she's turning 16
[00:52:10] this year she's 15 right now just like
[00:52:12] well just like she's turning 16 next
[00:52:17] month he said images right if I can read
[00:52:19] lips he said images can I read lips or
[00:52:22] did he piig you did did you're right
[00:52:25] here we go let's see the let's let's
[00:52:27] zoom out a little bit because I want to
[00:52:28] see that's so exciting wow I want to see
[00:52:31] both of them and I also want to see his
[00:52:32] teammates in
[00:52:37] back he's they moving Nelson yeah it's
[00:52:40] fair it's fair like there's no doubt
[00:52:42] they all fair Sportsmen but it's just
[00:52:45] like I If if like johanes is would be
[00:52:48] sitting there and I sit there like I
[00:52:49] know I shouldn't react but the moment it
[00:52:51] clicks the correct together of course
[00:52:52] you you can't hold it in how should you
[00:52:54] well like I know I know no one would do
[00:52:55] anything bad but people could give
[00:52:57] signals people could give signals but
[00:52:59] even like even if no one does on purpose
[00:53:01] just like if I was sitting there my
[00:53:03] teammate is doing yeah exactly and even
[00:53:07] like you don't want to do it because get
[00:53:09] told not to but okay don't it's too late
[00:53:12] you would yeah in particular me okay
[00:53:14] yeah that you got that okay honestly
[00:53:17] right now I think it's a coin flip it's
[00:53:21] 5050 it's it's really 50/50 because look
[00:53:23] at look at how PF have completely
[00:53:26] changed uh this is now
[00:53:30] really so tough for him and how he's
[00:53:33] looking up there and he's his entire
[00:53:35] entire body language changed
[00:53:38] completely he's
[00:53:41] focused yeah there was I just I just uh
[00:53:45] being messaged by his by his team
[00:53:47] captain cutner two
[00:53:50] one okay they are rushing through I
[00:53:54] think Alex probably will take it slow
[00:53:58] because he knows that pu will take it
[00:54:01] incredibly fast he's already done yeah
[00:54:03] we have the 10 seconds delay there like
[00:54:05] what time did he do and can he do it we
[00:54:07] will see it in a second yeah 19 it's not
[00:54:10] the fastest time so we know that he can
[00:54:13] do it seconds he's bringing the Memory
[00:54:17] Palace Alex has no other chance not to
[00:54:20] really take the full time and Hammer it
[00:54:22] into his brain I'm sure he will get it
[00:54:24] all correct amazing he has his eyes open
[00:54:26] Floren this is what I like see I like
[00:54:28] these jumpsuits everyone should have
[00:54:30] these xmt yeah this is this is why
[00:54:32] Sweden jumpsuit I wonder but that's not
[00:54:35] but that's not a Mongolian
[00:54:37] team jersey he's wearing a Swedish
[00:54:40] decade isn't he like it's has a Swedish
[00:54:41] flag I don't know but it looks impress
[00:54:43] Jer I don't
[00:54:45] know oh let's see what's happening now
[00:54:47] let's see what's happening it's so
[00:54:48] exciting W here we go the recall starts
[00:54:51] in 8 seconds best greetings to Mongolia
[00:54:54] I think there are so many people
[00:54:55] watching now and pressing their fingers
[00:54:56] crossing their shs right right I'm
[00:54:58] missing even these words up crossing
[00:55:00] their fingers or pressing their shs as
[00:55:01] we say in Germany all right here we go
[00:55:03] crossing
[00:55:05] fingers P starting at the
[00:55:07] bottom now Alex is moving quickly come
[00:55:11] on yeah pu got the last ones last four
[00:55:14] both of them got the last four that they
[00:55:16] put into their shortterm memory the same
[00:55:18] same amount kind of funny there although
[00:55:20] not very surprising that Alex got it
[00:55:21] right took the entire time oh
[00:55:25] is very confident he he puts two
[00:55:28] images on one
[00:55:32] location wow yes he does so fire is
[00:55:35] looking good oh my God both are looking
[00:55:38] very good Alex had whole minute Alex
[00:55:42] just did it he in 30 he's look I think
[00:55:45] he's getting it oh my God he's getting
[00:55:46] he's already finished delay he's
[00:55:49] knocking out
[00:55:51] Alex two Mongolians are going into the J
[00:55:56] can we believe that we don't know yet he
[00:55:57] might change something but this is how
[00:56:00] it looks he looks conf there's like like
[00:56:01] a there's so many so many people in
[00:56:04] Mongolia right now who are like
[00:56:05] completely going nuts yeah because this
[00:56:07] country they have this strong team so
[00:56:09] many people there katner with this
[00:56:11] gigantic memory school and it's a big
[00:56:14] sport it's a really big sport it's
[00:56:15] probably one of those countries where
[00:56:17] more people know about this than
[00:56:19] anywhere else in the world except China
[00:56:21] maybe Al again is in this mode he knows
[00:56:23] he has it but he has to wait and no he
[00:56:25] he has no idea he doesn't know he
[00:56:27] doesn't know yet that he is beaten by
[00:56:30] Junior from Mongolia the World mmory
[00:56:32] Champ still checking p is still checking
[00:56:34] we don't know yeah it's it's not set in
[00:56:36] stone yet we don't know I kind of think
[00:56:37] it' be awesome if you just switches one
[00:56:45] out Alex doesn't look like he will do
[00:56:47] anything anymore he's still I know he's
[00:56:49] done Alex knows he has it then he can
[00:56:51] just wait he can just wait he's looking
[00:56:53] at me he's staring at yeah Pro job Pro
[00:56:56] job could the could our team maybe try
[00:56:59] to get the um the champion card from
[00:57:03] from puj and hold it ready after think
[00:57:07] pu also look look at his face he's no
[00:57:09] more in The Confident mode again don't
[00:57:11] show the champion card yet but keep it
[00:57:13] for after we have seen oh no he's the
[00:57:17] only one we don't have the card because
[00:57:19] he didn't he didn't answer my survey he
[00:57:20] was the only one that didn't have a
[00:57:21] chance
[00:57:23] ask still allowed to compete if you
[00:57:26] didn't right 90
[00:57:34] seconds look all there the people in the
[00:57:36] back they know I they shouldn't react
[00:57:38] but they all know it and like oh my guys
[00:57:41] the world champion is out yeah right
[00:57:42] because most of them are from the unit
[00:57:44] States look like yanes Joe and and the
[00:57:46] Germans are also sitting there trying to
[00:57:47] look away not to give any sign more
[00:57:49] because they know it and thinking like
[00:57:52] I'm not allowed to do anything now which
[00:57:53] is by the way which is by the way still
[00:57:55] kind of a dangerous thing of the xmt
[00:57:57] that there all these people are there
[00:57:58] immediately more exciting makes it more
[00:58:00] exciting still a US US athlete will not
[00:58:05] win the xmt again less than 60 seconds
[00:58:07] to see like a revolution of results but
[00:58:11] any on the other hand we have the two

[02:17:06] ears of
[02:17:07] competitors again I just want you to see
[02:17:10] how this will unplay um we'll go into
[02:17:12] the details afterwards um this is just
[02:17:15] to get a general idea of what the event
[02:17:17] is and how it goes
[02:17:21] [Music]
[02:17:27] down surprise event 3 random sounds
[02:17:30] playlist competitor prep time is 2
[02:17:33] minutes data is 50 sound bytes or less
[02:17:37] memorization time as long as the sounds
[02:17:39] play recall time 6 minutes 3 2
[02:17:46] 1
[02:17:49] [Music]
[02:18:02] scoring is plus one for every correctly
[02:18:04] placed sound file minus one for every
[02:18:06] incorrectly placed sound file no points
[02:18:09] for
[02:18:14] blanks that's okay that's what we'll do
[02:18:16] now
[02:18:34] yeah you can turn over the sheets on
[02:18:36] your desk you can turn over the sheets
[02:18:38] on your desk and the rules are there and
[02:18:41] the sample demo
[02:18:45] recall all right so we'll go through
[02:18:48] this together it's called the random
[02:18:49] sounds playlist pretty much
[02:18:51] self-explanatory in the title it will be
[02:18:54] a playlist of random sounds that we play
[02:18:56] for you which you have to remember the
[02:18:57] order of how they were played you'll
[02:19:00] have two minutes to prep once everything
[02:19:02] is understood and we all agree that we
[02:19:04] understand I'll give you two minutes to
[02:19:05] kind of prepare your game plan much like
[02:19:08] the images event we did before and then
[02:19:11] after those two minutes are up we will
[02:19:14] give you a countdown and start the
[02:19:16] sounds
[02:19:18] so what you'll have to memorize is the
[02:19:21] order of a sequence of 1 second sound
[02:19:24] bites there will be less than 50 sounds
[02:19:27] we're not going to tell you exactly how
[02:19:28] many there are but just know that there
[02:19:30] are less than 50
[02:19:33] okay part of the surprise is exactly how
[02:19:36] many sounds there will be like I said
[02:19:38] there will be a 30 second countdown
[02:19:40] after the 2 minutes of prep time and we
[02:19:43] will give a 10-second countdown so I'll
[02:19:45] tell you there's 30 seconds and then
[02:19:47] I'll say 10 seconds 3 2 1 and then we
[02:19:52] will play the audio file on the
[02:19:54] loudspeaker everyone will hear it at the
[02:19:55] same time audience you'll have to listen
[02:19:58] to so please make sure it's absolutely
[02:20:00] silent so that they can
[02:20:02] concentrate CC you understand so far
[02:20:05] yeah no okay which
[02:20:14] part yes yeah okay I'm I explain recall
[02:20:18] so you'll hear the the sounds okay no
[02:20:20] headphones are allowed um you just
[02:20:23] listen to what's
[02:20:24] playing um the sequence will only be
[02:20:26] played one time through and the way it
[02:20:29] will sound we'll do a demo is each sound
[02:20:31] is a second long and there's a slight
[02:20:33] Gap in between so it's not exactly 1
[02:20:36] second one second it's maybe one second
[02:20:38] a little break one
[02:20:41] second the the sounds are each distinct
[02:20:44] and randomly
[02:20:46] chosen when the memorization has
[02:20:48] finished we will tell you to turn over
[02:20:51] your recall sheet which is on the floor
[02:20:53] right
[02:20:54] now during your recall you will play the
[02:20:57] 1C audio files on your laptop so there's
[02:20:59] a folder on your desktop that
[02:21:02] has which will set up for you that has
[02:21:05] every sound file however many there are
[02:21:08] which you can play through and hear can
[02:21:10] we
[02:21:11] can of course many you want yeah and our
[02:21:15] sheet will not
[02:21:18] right this is just the demo it'll be all
[02:21:20] exactly the recall sheet will be the
[02:21:22] correct number of ss yeah so the file
[02:21:26] names will be lettered
[02:21:28] so A through Z and then if there's more
[02:21:31] than that it'll be a a bb or a AA BBB so
[02:21:35] we're just using a letter convention
[02:21:37] there
[02:21:39] okay we're also going to do a a live
[02:21:42] demo you have to practice on so it'll be
[02:21:46] ring
[02:21:58] well the way you you'll have your your
[02:22:00] sounds in the file aren't the same
[02:22:02] order they're in alphabetical
[02:22:05] order not in order of yeah we had to
[02:22:09] work hard to do that okay so no
[02:22:11] headphones allowed during
[02:22:13] recall so the sounds will be played or
[02:22:16] no no earplugs either so the sounds that
[02:22:19] you're playing when you listen will be
[02:22:20] played all four competitors bit of a
[02:22:23] distraction yes that's part of
[02:22:26] it so you must place the file name the
[02:22:29] letter of the correct sound in the
[02:22:32] correct location on your recall sheet so
[02:22:34] it's numbered one through the demo five
[02:22:37] so we'll do the practice but say letter
[02:22:40] sound B was first you put B in one right
[02:22:43] sound a was second put it in two and so
[02:22:47] on
[02:22:48] you'll have six minutes for this recall
[02:22:51] okay so let's are you guys ready to do
[02:22:53] the demo understand most mostly so we
[02:22:56] can try this demo FJ CC understand
[02:23:14] mostly for for this test what I suggest
[02:23:18] there are there are five sounds so it's
[02:23:22] slight silence after the time and then
[02:23:24] sound Silent Sound Silent Sound I would
[02:23:27] suggest using the journey you don't plan
[02:23:29] on using as a test um and actually try
[02:23:33] to memorize them as if this were the
[02:23:35] competition or if if you if you so
[02:23:37] choose but you'll see how it goes and
[02:23:39] then we'll do the full recall and
[02:23:40] everything you'll be playing them on the
[02:23:42] computer we're going to do a full demo a
[02:23:44] full
[02:23:45] trial so this is how this will go we
[02:23:48] given you the 2 minutes and then we said
[02:23:50] okay 30 seconds of Prem
[02:24:15] memorization it's
[02:24:40] okay so 30 seconds of Prem memorization
[02:24:42] we're getting down to 10 I say 10
[02:24:44] seconds left then 3 2
[02:24:55] [Music]
[02:24:58] 1
[02:25:00] okay so now you may turn over your demo
[02:25:10] [Music]
[02:25:15] recall
[02:25:18] and have Dem Rec started okay and you
[02:25:22] may yeah go ahead I mean we're not going
[02:25:24] to time this but just go ahead and play
[02:25:26] around with
[02:25:28] [Music]
[02:25:45] it
[02:25:48] [Music]
[02:25:50] this is my favorite round this my
[02:25:53] favorite
[02:26:15] round
[02:26:20] for the demo when everybody's done with
[02:26:22] the demo just raise your hand that
[02:26:24] you're done you understand what's going
[02:26:26] on J
[02:26:29] understand so that's how it'll play do
[02:26:32] not open the folder on your computer
[02:26:35] until in fact we will put the a folder
[02:26:38] on your computer when it's
[02:26:40] time you can close out of everything
[02:26:43] that you have open on your computer
[02:26:45] screen
[02:26:56] so there will be a 30 second delay
[02:27:01] between memorization and getting
[02:27:04] everybody's computers open to the
[02:27:06] correct folding so just prepare yourself
[02:27:09] for that there will be a slight delay
[02:27:10] audience will keep it quiet but um there
[02:27:13] will be a delay for that and as you
[02:27:16] heard I mean some of the sounds are a
[02:27:18] bit bizarre might make you laugh or be
[02:27:21] weird just try to keep it together um so
[02:27:23] that they can concentrate especially
[02:27:25] during the re the
[02:27:26] memorization and also during the recall
[02:27:29] it will sound A bit chaotic but please
[02:27:30] try to keep it
[02:27:34] together
[02:27:35] to no more than 50 yep and remember that
[02:27:39] the scoring okay let's talk about the
[02:27:42] scoring is plus one for correct minus
[02:27:45] one for incorrect but zero for
[02:27:54] black
[02:28:15] understand
[02:28:24] we believe we have the sound at the
[02:28:26] appropriate
[02:28:28] level if it's not we'll be
[02:28:45] raising
[02:29:20] seconds 10 seconds yes okay you have you
[02:29:24] have six minutes if everybody's done and
[02:29:28] you know you're
[02:29:30] done raise your hand so we don't have to
[02:29:32] sit for all six minutes if you're all
[02:29:34] done in the first 30 seconds or did you
[02:29:36] guys want the
[02:29:37] [Music]
[02:29:43] Tim okay so your 2 minutes of
[02:29:45] preparation Time start
[02:29:47] Starts
[02:30:15] Now
[02:30:45] for
[02:31:15] for
[02:31:45] for
[02:31:48] your Prem memorization will start now
[02:31:51] you have 30 seconds before we
[02:32:15] begin
[02:32:17] 10
[02:32:23] seconds 3 2 1
[02:32:32] [Applause]
[02:32:36] [Music]
[02:32:45] begin
[02:32:54] [Music]
[02:33:03] [Music]
[02:33:12] [Music]
[02:33:15] oh
[02:33:45] for
[02:34:15] for
[02:34:25] you may pick up your recall
[02:34:27] sheets and turn them
[02:34:31] over uh you may be you may begin
[02:34:45] now
[02:34:49] all right we are back at the extreme
[02:34:51] memory tournament 2016 this is extremely
[02:34:54] exciting this is the semifinals right
[02:34:56] now the surprise event is even a
[02:34:59] surprise to us once again yeah and this
[02:35:01] time it's noises all different sounds
[02:35:05] and each sound is in 1 second and they
[02:35:07] have to recall it and they only get one
[02:35:10] chance at doing it it's super difficult
[02:35:12] I think they call it the random sounds
[02:35:15] playlist
[02:35:16] and yeah they had 2 minutes preparation
[02:35:20] time um 50 sounds or less what I count I
[02:35:24] didn't count it but it sounded
[02:35:26] like I think it was half of it at best
[02:35:28] at best I think yeah like something 15
[02:35:30] to 20 right um and they have now 6
[02:35:33] minutes recall time
[02:35:35] to um play around with the software that
[02:35:38] they in front of them for some I'm not
[02:35:41] quite sure how it works but they they
[02:35:44] they they yeah yeah I don't know how it
[02:35:47] looks like on the computers but for they
[02:35:49] can somehow pick it up there and now
[02:35:52] they have these recall sheets um they
[02:35:55] basically look like what we used to do
[02:35:57] in the pen and paper events where we
[02:35:59] have words they look pretty much like
[02:36:01] our words recall sheets a little bit and
[02:36:03] they have to type onto every
[02:36:06] number so we have 1 2 3 4 5 order here
[02:36:09] and I have to write down the file number
[02:36:12] and I think they can click on the files
[02:36:14] on the computers and hear it one more
[02:36:18] time actually since we don't hear an
[02:36:20] audio stream right now from the from the
[02:36:22] room yeah um I think in the room they
[02:36:24] might you might hear all these sounds
[02:36:26] popping up now I don't think so no but
[02:36:29] how how can they how can they make sure
[02:36:31] that what they
[02:36:33] hear maybe maybe our Tech Team can
[02:36:36] confirm this are they playing around
[02:36:38] with the sounds in the room are there
[02:36:39] any sounds popping up in the room I
[02:36:43] think it's silent doesn't no they they
[02:36:45] play for sound and now they have to
[02:36:47] recall that's it they just what how do
[02:36:49] they how do they know which F number
[02:36:52] what is I don't quite get how they
[02:36:55] recall that but I mean we can ask them
[02:36:58] later yeah what
[02:37:02] is what is sure is that they hear they
[02:37:05] heard these sounds I mean you heard it
[02:37:06] before in the Stream uh they were
[02:37:08] clicking and and and squeaking and
[02:37:12] whatever like baby crying yeah like a
[02:37:15] bell and
[02:37:16] that's not a baby crying but whatever um
[02:37:19] yeah um I just want to go through their
[02:37:22] facial expressions of what they were
[02:37:23] doing so he had Simon he kept shaking
[02:37:25] his head his eyes were closed um then
[02:37:29] you had Mo uh then you
[02:37:34] had three minutes left and then I saw
[02:37:37] the two Mongolians
[02:37:39] CC uh she I don't know they both look
[02:37:42] very calm and cool and collected during
[02:37:44] it right I mean what what we saw with
[02:37:47] Simon that was that was his calm face
[02:37:50] yeah this is he had exactly the same
[02:37:53] face when he broke the the cards world
[02:37:55] record he was like the head spinning
[02:37:57] left right left right his hand is um
[02:38:00] moving a little bit and like like he's
[02:38:02] physically placing his images there on
[02:38:04] the
[02:38:05] location and and pvv was just staring at
[02:38:08] him
[02:38:09] after sharing him down yeah so yeah
[02:38:13] that's that's a brilliant idea I like it
[02:38:15] I like it a lot
[02:38:16] if if I would have memorized that I
[02:38:18] would have tried to visualize what I
[02:38:19] hear and I put that visual image you put
[02:38:22] like let's say it's on the
[02:38:27] location so Constantine schoa is just
[02:38:31] writing me everyone in the room hears
[02:38:33] all the files they hear from all four
[02:38:35] competitors Jacob Gorman writes me they
[02:38:38] open a folder on the computer with all
[02:38:40] the sounds and can play them as many
[02:38:41] times as they want no headphones so that
[02:38:44] would mean that when when when one
[02:38:46] competitor a plays them all the others
[02:38:48] hear them as well and there must be like
[02:38:49] an orchestra now in the room yeah if
[02:38:51] that's really true I kind want to turn
[02:38:53] on the computer I in the TV um yeah s
[02:38:57] sadly we can't really approve that
[02:38:59] because we in a different room we can we
[02:39:01] can hear them they cannot hear us that
[02:39:03] would be otherwise
[02:39:05] extr only I can hear is Florian I have
[02:39:07] po by the way I have posted I have
[02:39:09] posted the sheet with the rules on the
[02:39:14] memory sports.com Facebook
[02:39:16] uh page so if if you guys who are on
[02:39:19] Facebook want to check this out you can
[02:39:20] you can go there and read the rules for
[02:39:23] yourself if you didn't really pick that
[02:39:24] up
[02:39:26] perfectly um yeah anyway this is this is
[02:39:30] exciting this is really difficult one
[02:39:32] and it was so fast it's like spoken
[02:39:34] numbers one one of these disciplines we
[02:39:36] have in the traditional championships
[02:39:38] and spoken numbers is already tough and
[02:39:40] it's a straightforward discipline that
[02:39:42] you can prepare for and even then it's
[02:39:44] extremely difficult do we know how many
[02:39:46] minutes are left in the
[02:39:47] [Music]
[02:39:50] recall not much probably
[02:39:53] but one minute left minut second here
[02:39:56] one minut look at
[02:39:58] CC she's 15 years old okay um Jake Jake
[02:40:03] o' Gorman is just um adding that it acts
[02:40:06] as an edit distraction to make it a bit
[02:40:08] more extreme Nelson explained it I like
[02:40:10] that so everyone is hearing with
[02:40:11] everyone else is just testing out so
[02:40:14] that is that is an orchestra right now
[02:40:17] of clicks and sounds that's what I
[02:40:18] always wanted a little distraction yeah
[02:40:21] actually they can even Hammer these
[02:40:22] sounds to distract the others if they
[02:40:24] already got I don't know that's a good
[02:40:27] that's a good move we can we can check
[02:40:28] this out later that our our viewers will
[02:40:31] probably hear that because they have an
[02:40:33] I think they should have an audio from
[02:40:34] the room right now look who's in back
[02:40:36] the legend Ben
[02:40:38] pritmore yeah he's sitting there in the
[02:40:40] back
[02:40:41] right CCE looks
[02:40:44] confident
[02:40:46] here we go and now they're handing
[02:40:48] they're handing they off to
[02:40:50] Nelson yeah he's collecting their recall
[02:40:53] sheets right
[02:40:54] now and I think they can probably get
[02:40:58] the results very very quickly because it
[02:41:00] was not too hard to double check that
[02:41:02] with a with a prepar recall sheet so
[02:41:05] they can just see immediately what they
[02:41:07] got wrong and right and cross this off
[02:41:09] that shouldn't take more than 5 minutes
[02:41:11] and then we know what got all the random
[02:41:14] sounds playlist do you remember any of
[02:41:16] the sounds um I remember I remember
[02:41:19] something like a xylophone where going
[02:41:22] bummmm bum I think you were playing your
[02:41:24] own maybe I I didn't really try to
[02:41:27] memorize it was just so so stunned by
[02:41:30] that I think this my definitely my
[02:41:32] favorite surprise event right now and
[02:41:35] it's the hardest too right yeah it's
[02:41:38] really cool yeah so let's see what's so
[02:41:39] let's see what they do out of that I
[02:41:41] mean right now we cannot really do much
[02:41:43] we already see here on one of our videos
[02:41:45] videos that Simon Orton and Beth the
[02:41:49] wife of um Brad are now just checking
[02:41:51] that and crossing crossing off what they
[02:41:54] got here's a here's a video feed from
[02:41:58] Cy by the way it's it's puji not Fuji
[02:42:03] Fuji yeah I was his his his cousin or
[02:42:06] Aunt who lives actually in the United
[02:42:08] States was was saying we got it
[02:42:10] completely incorrect yesterday okay so
[02:42:11] it'si with a p huh so
[02:42:16] yeah Simon
[02:42:18] is very relaxed there going in his mind
[02:42:20] trying to figure out what's going on Pui
[02:42:22] is going through the room trying
[02:42:25] to walk it off relaxing yeah exactly
[02:42:29] what's Simon oh oh s Simon is still
[02:42:32] trying to figure out if he got it right
[02:42:34] or wrong praying to the extreme memory
[02:42:36] Gods maybe relaxing there a little bit
[02:42:39] to prepare himself for what is about to
[02:42:43] come yeah man this is this this is
[02:42:47] really extreme this is incredible it's
[02:42:51] beautiful thing uh I'm pretty sure that
[02:42:53] no one of those four will get all sounds
[02:42:56] it's like I would I would bet on that I
[02:42:59] bet you Simon has all the sounds yeah
[02:43:03] yep okay so
[02:43:09] see yeah by the way I have we can we can
[02:43:12] play this here I have this app on my on
[02:43:14] my phone where where we can create all
[02:43:17] these crazy sounds so if you guys out
[02:43:19] there want to try this how this is going
[02:43:22] to work then um all you need to do is
[02:43:25] close your eyes now and listen to that
[02:43:28] close your eyes every now and
[02:43:33] [Music]
[02:43:38] then it's probably even faster than that
[02:43:42] was faster than
[02:43:44] that
[02:43:46] all right did you get that I didn't
[02:43:49] memorize it I memorized it let me go
[02:43:52] through it all right come on here we go
[02:43:54] so it
[02:44:00] was no I didn't I think I didn't use the
[02:44:03] baby no I know you didn't I didn't use
[02:44:04] the baby you already messed it
[02:44:09] up all right so Beth and Simon are still
[02:44:13] checking h husband and wife right
[02:44:17] there I'm not going to tell you which
[02:44:18] one's which you're going to have to
[02:44:20] guess whose husband and
[02:44:26] wife all
[02:44:30] right so let's wait for it just crazy
[02:44:33] how everybody came from so far away like
[02:44:36] Simon he came from all the way from
[02:44:38] Australia right by the way I mean our
[02:44:42] our fans out there they always know more
[02:44:43] than we do and as it seems that's that's
[02:44:46] why we get so great feedback on on
[02:44:48] Facebook where everyone is correcting us
[02:44:50] so if you guys know if the semi-finals
[02:44:53] actually do have a second surprise
[02:44:55] events what I think they do have please
[02:44:59] confirm that on on Facebook I think the
[02:45:03] finals tomorrow will have even three
[02:45:07] surprise events but I'm not 100% sure I
[02:45:10] think so but they have you know they
[02:45:13] have nine best out of nine tomorrow yep
[02:45:15] and this is still best out of seven yeah
[02:45:17] these uh surprise events take a little
[02:45:22] while yeah sure Dam here we go table two
[02:45:26] with Johannes and
[02:45:28] puj puj wins with a score of 11 over
[02:45:32] johanes
[02:45:37] 9 at T one between Simon and CCE CeCe
[02:45:43] wins with his final score eight
[02:45:50] [Applause]
[02:45:53] we're
[02:45:55] 31
[02:45:57] wow
[02:46:14] w
[02:46:16] [Music]
[02:46:17] okay so at table one cc takes the lead
[02:46:20] one Zer at table two so puj just won
[02:46:25] yeah and then who won the other round no
[02:46:28] that's that's the winner from from one
[02:46:31] table P against
[02:46:33] Johannes Sim one CeCe CE CC W against
[02:46:38] Simon so both Mongolians go into the
[02:46:41] lead against the against the reigning
[02:46:44] champion and the previously reigning
[02:46:46] champion this is crazy and how I bet
[02:46:48] both their ages together are the same
[02:46:50] age as
[02:46:51] Simon yeah right if you if you that's
[02:46:54] true yeah if you put both of them
[02:46:55] together that's nuts look at these two
[02:46:58] Geniuses well they're not but they are
[02:47:00] right right I mean they're they're
[02:47:03] extreme memory Sports prodigies yeah
[02:47:07] they're not a genius because we all
[02:47:09] Geniuses or no one is a genius depends
[02:47:11] on how you want to look at that I am a
[02:47:12] genius all right um so so wow very
[02:47:16] exciting so now the Germans
[02:47:20] are U to pick the next events the
[02:47:24] Germans let's the Germans exactly
[02:47:28] exactly let us now
[02:47:31] we're so at table three CCE and Simon
[02:47:35] pick cards and at table four puj and
[02:47:38] Johannes have
[02:47:40] images all
[02:47:42] right and uh Shen day said Well Done CC
[02:47:48] and
[02:47:50] puj where do you get that from on the
[02:47:53] Twitter from Twitter yep and then uh
[02:47:55] Shin shinid said go team
[02:47:58] Mongolia right they really are on fire
[02:48:02] Mongolia is awesome cce's back with the
[02:48:04] paper on her head no newspaper today
[02:48:06] that's a big
[02:48:08] change how exciting is that the the
[02:48:12] Masters are behind
[02:48:15] the Juniors from Mongolia and now yanas
[02:48:18] picked images against Pui who seemed to
[02:48:21] be extremely good at images so what is
[02:48:24] going on there he's going to try to
[02:48:26] throw her off he can beat her at this
[02:48:28] and he thinks he can take the rest home
[02:48:29] with him right so Simon P cots he's
[02:48:33] coming into her house and he's stealing
[02:48:34] everything from her right he's shaking
[02:48:37] things up baby you know what I what I
[02:48:39] think is that both Simon and um johannas
[02:48:43] don't exactly know what what to do with
[02:48:46] these two because they probably don't
[02:48:48] know them so well they have met them
[02:48:50] before championships you can't read them
[02:48:52] yeah and and also they don't exactly see
[02:48:55] where their strengths are do you think
[02:48:58] yeah 100% I don't know at all
[02:49:02] so I'm sure it would be much easier for
[02:49:04] for for Simon to get an idea of what he
[02:49:08] has to do when he's competing against
[02:49:09] Alex although Alex really good at
[02:49:11] everything but this is like I think they
[02:49:14] sit there like wondering what do I have
[02:49:16] to do what do I do now I don't know like
[02:49:18] guessing or whatever although I saw
[02:49:20] Simon doing a lot of preparation in the
[02:49:22] lunch break so well here we go 3 seconds
[02:49:28] to go 2
[02:49:30] 1 second R just started so double card
[02:49:34] system from Simon against the Pao system
[02:49:37] from CC which is kind of like a one
[02:49:40] single card system with person action
[02:49:43] object mhm right she's putting H Pio on
[02:49:47] one location and we have Pui racing
[02:49:50] images but Johan already stopped at 1.51
[02:49:53] there you go German obviously Pui is now
[02:49:57] taking it slow and going through the 60
[02:49:59] seconds Simon too that an other German
[02:50:01] 27.45 seconds in
[02:50:03] cards which
[02:50:05] is still still a fast time but kind of a
[02:50:10] secure time for
[02:50:13] him now both the Mongolians are just
[02:50:17] reviewing CC
[02:50:18] andj it gives them it gives him a really
[02:50:22] actually gives him a both of the
[02:50:24] Mongolians a really good position
[02:50:26] because they can relax now and they
[02:50:29] actually just have to make sure that
[02:50:31] that they got what they needed ref you
[02:50:34] have stopped at 54.8 n seconds other was
[02:50:38] doesn't need the 5 Seconds he could have
[02:50:40] he could have used the last 5 Seconds to
[02:50:42] look more at it but on the other hand
[02:50:45] if you use so much time then you can
[02:50:47] make a educated guess that you either
[02:50:49] got it or you didn't get it so it
[02:50:51] doesn't really matter if you have a if
[02:50:52] you look at your images five more
[02:50:54] seconds because what you create in the
[02:50:57] first moment is essential and me you
[02:51:00] have a second look at it and you kind of
[02:51:01] get a good feeling about it then it
[02:51:03] doesn't really matter at the last
[02:51:04] seconds I'm going to try it out
[02:51:07] so
[02:51:09] um yeah here we go they both start from
[02:51:13] the bottom now they're here
[02:51:17] no one has done any mistakes so far but
[02:51:20] they still have to go halfway through
[02:51:23] johanes is taking very slow there but I
[02:51:25] mean it's normal it's normal and he has
[02:51:27] a lot of time left PJ is just going to
[02:51:29] get it done PJ had a double had a had an
[02:51:32] Omission there so one one image he
[02:51:34] didn't quite
[02:51:35] no saying I couldn't even finish my
[02:51:37] sentence he already finished that look
[02:51:39] at Simon he's on fire Simon is on fire
[02:51:42] but he's not completely done yet so
[02:51:44] let's see where he's going with that
[02:51:46] he's done he is done johanes does have
[02:51:50] two omissions there already three
[02:51:51] omissions four no 3-1 there um four
[02:51:56] omissions um he's just filling in the
[02:51:59] last regular ones there as it seems and
[02:52:03] now he is at the he created a little
[02:52:05] cross there the first one goes into the
[02:52:08] has a mistake there but he might figure
[02:52:10] it out because his system is really
[02:52:12] beneficial for seeing what's going on
[02:52:14] there he's figuring it out right now
[02:52:16] he's figuring it out right now and now
[02:52:18] johannas is still left with three images
[02:52:20] that is a tough one if he has three
[02:52:22] images and this is not like the cards it
[02:52:24] would be much easier for for Simon to
[02:52:27] for joh and she's
[02:52:30] finished Simon got the point Johannes is
[02:52:34] still struggling but he got he got it
[02:52:37] right he right both Germans take home
[02:52:41] second take their points into Mongolia
[02:52:45] and Germany wins this event although I
[02:52:47] actually I actually don't really want to
[02:52:50] make this a national thing I think
[02:52:51] everyone is yeah but you both when I
[02:52:53] hear about it you guys are coming
[02:52:55] together like the Germans coming
[02:52:56] together Mongolians coming together it
[02:52:57] kind of is yeah it's true I mean we know
[02:52:59] we know each other for so long and but
[02:53:02] nevertheless it's it's it's not a
[02:53:04] national sport here that we have there's
[02:53:07] not nothing you're not rationing the
[02:53:08] money you're keeping the money for
[02:53:09] yourself so it is oh look at this Simon
[02:53:11] is changing it ooh
[02:53:14] bad idea Simon same with johanes he's
[02:53:18] changing his too oh Simon is just
[02:53:20] playing wow look at us Simon is just
[02:53:22] playing around he just put it out again
[02:53:25] oh man this this is really killing us we
[02:53:28] watching this how can you do this and
[02:53:31] Johannes what is
[02:53:35] Johannes man is so exciting okay Simon
[02:53:39] got it correct again he was just playing
[02:53:40] around and checking if that looks good
[02:53:42] or not but Johan
[02:53:46] I don't know I think he might have
[02:53:49] settled for this choice now you think
[02:53:53] so he doesn't look like he's playing
[02:53:55] around and clicking there back and forth
[02:53:58] but we don't know maybe let's go to yeah
[02:54:00] let's go to johanes right now let's
[02:54:01] let's have a look at Johannes here there
[02:54:03] must be a lot of um facial expression
[02:54:06] but Simon is not done there look at
[02:54:08] Johan is looking actually it's there's
[02:54:11] more going on with Simon right now than
[02:54:13] with johanes
[02:54:14] yeah Simon is really really going
[02:54:17] through that he's not sure Johannes on
[02:54:20] the other hand he's kind of very
[02:54:23] very he's not convinced look at Sim
[02:54:26] moving Simon just calling it Simon might
[02:54:28] make a change there you go he stay away
[02:54:31] he's he's leaning backwards Johannes put
[02:54:33] it back I I I think they will stay with
[02:54:35] this
[02:54:36] Choice wow Johannes made a big biges
[02:54:40] will be very angry about this one let's
[02:54:42] go to Johannes there we go
[02:54:44] yeah there he's there he's um knocking
[02:54:48] at his own forehead
[02:54:51] and obviously being very disappointed
[02:54:53] that he changed it in the in the last
[02:54:55] minute or that already he already got it
[02:54:57] right look at Simon he's so excited
[02:54:59] Simon is happy that he actually got it
[02:55:02] right got it wrong got it right again
[02:55:04] yep that's exhausting right there Simon
[02:55:06] is doing it quite often it's interesting
[02:55:08] and we we talked about this earlier that
[02:55:09] he's playing around with this and then
[02:55:11] he's asking his feeling and there's so
[02:55:13] much feeling involved when you memorize
[02:55:15] so quickly so much emotion yeah and this
[02:55:20] CC right so this makes our semifinals
[02:55:25] now one against one for cc and Simon and
[02:55:29] puts Pui into the lead two against zero
[02:55:32] against the number one ranking memory
[02:55:34] athlete in the world who got more points
[02:55:36] than anyone else ever before you know
[02:55:38] you know what I'd like to thank we
[02:55:40] haven't really thanked them enough washu
[02:55:42] for sponsoring this in Dart NeuroScience
[02:55:46] absolutely and D Neuroscience really
[02:55:49] made a huge difference for the sport
[02:55:52] without without them and of course the
[02:55:54] brilliant ideas of of Nelson and Simon
[02:55:56] Aon we wouldn't be able to sit here we
[02:55:58] wouldn't be able to enjoy this fantastic
[02:56:00] competition I would to be able to enjoy
[02:56:01] your company and and we would we would
[02:56:03] still say that these pen and paper um
[02:56:06] events are cool why did you take off my
[02:56:09] base
[02:56:11] well it needs to get it needs to come
[02:56:13] off see my nice head but you know what
[02:56:16] right now Simon's tied up with
[02:56:19] Cece and johanes and PJ johannas is
[02:56:24] losing 02 it's a little scary well last
[02:56:28] year he was he was behind I think three
[02:56:33] points and then he won all the matches I
[02:56:36] mean it's really two is not that bad
[02:56:38] it's not that bad but now it's pji's
[02:56:41] pick isn't it yeah so on the other other
[02:56:44] hand is really good at all that they're
[02:56:47] all really good at everything here
[02:56:49] although I must still say I don't really
[02:56:51] know about CeCe which what what her
[02:56:54] strengths are but she seems to be a oh
[02:56:56] they're already starting the next event
[02:56:57] here we go mhm so so Simon and C he
[02:57:00] doing images yep and then at table four
[02:57:02] pej and johanes are doing
[02:57:05] numbers which is interesting pick for
[02:57:08] puj because Johannes was the word record
[02:57:11] holder for this one and and what is the
[02:57:15] current world record in numbers
[02:57:18] it's 20 2.01 silver yanas so he's
[02:57:24] actually actually that's not true that
[02:57:26] was a that was a a previous record now
[02:57:29] we have 7.65 this year by Alex
[02:57:43] 21.84% is world record which is not the
[02:57:46] world record anymore you say again world
[02:57:48] record did I did I say it like that like
[02:57:51] the German style yeah we we pronounce
[02:57:53] the W like you pronounce the V yeah and
[02:57:57] I try not to make that mistake but
[02:57:59] sometimes it creeps in hey but it sounds
[02:58:01] cool all right now they're starting the
[02:58:04] recall wow PJ is starting from the
[02:58:07] top both of them are right and CC really
[02:58:11] stopped at an incredible fast time of 7
[02:58:14] .79 which sounds like super slow now
[02:58:17] compared to the world record which is
[02:58:20] 13 um 91 by L right it's incredible but
[02:58:26] it's really a A Dangerous Time a
[02:58:30] dangerous time for the images I think
[02:58:31] it's more dangerous to do a fast time
[02:58:33] and images like this compared to the
[02:58:35] numbers
[02:58:36] because oh you can so easily screw that
[02:58:39] one up while the numbers you can go
[02:58:41] through your system everything PJ just
[02:58:44] finished numbers yeah he he he's on fire
[02:58:49] certainly and now it's all up to
[02:58:50] Johannes if he can gets it together CC
[02:58:53] doesn't look very confident this is slow
[02:58:57] doesn't mean doesn't mean much but
[02:58:59] actually in the in the images you can
[02:59:02] kind of get a feeling for how well they
[02:59:04] know their stuff
[02:59:07] because yeah like I said earlier when
[02:59:09] you remember the images they come fast
[02:59:11] when you don't remember them you have a
[02:59:14] problem
[02:59:15] so we will see what she's pulling off
[02:59:18] there Simon already got everything
[02:59:20] together johannas Johannes has one
[02:59:24] image one single image missing and a
[02:59:27] double image missing you know what's
[02:59:30] interesting can get this together I know
[02:59:31] we you weren't putting a big emphasis on
[02:59:34] ranking but CC came in ranking at
[02:59:38] 12 and PJ came ranking in at 11 so
[02:59:42] they're back to back and and so these
[02:59:44] two are too yeah these two have won the
[02:59:48] xmt before and Simon is already playing
[02:59:50] around with his images again and putting
[02:59:52] in something in the wrong spot and I'm
[02:59:53] putting it in the right spot and
[02:59:56] sometimes I get a feeling like he wants
[02:59:57] to he wants to

[00:00:01] having a good memory she's pretty young
[00:00:04] but she was already doing the 10 years
[00:00:10] [Music]
[00:00:21] ago
[00:00:28] yeah
[00:00:32] so what's going
[00:00:34] on I'm I'm
[00:00:38] waiting okay what is going on
[00:00:42] ni I
[00:00:48] mean excuse
[00:00:52] me it's
[00:00:58] Unforgivable
[00:01:04] [Music]
[00:01:15] [Applause]
[00:01:27] welcome back to the second half of the
[00:01:28] extreme memory tournament I'm Max
[00:01:31] burkwitz and I'm Florian deay so nice to
[00:01:34] see you guys again we are in the second
[00:01:38] round of the first day of the extreme
[00:01:41] memory tournament the coolest fastest
[00:01:43] hottest greatest memory competition in
[00:01:45] the world and we are here for you to
[00:01:47] explain what the heck is going on
[00:01:50] exactly and you're explaining a little
[00:01:52] uh more detail exactly I will explain
[00:01:55] the way that there are still question
[00:01:57] marks over your head yes still see them
[00:02:00] there oh yeah yeah yeah they're they're
[00:02:02] they're fading away though yeah we we're
[00:02:05] doing good I mean the idea of course is
[00:02:07] that everyone out there who is not yet
[00:02:10] uh familiar with memory Sports will
[00:02:12] understand how we do this and what this
[00:02:16] structure of the xmt is all about how
[00:02:19] this works and what they see here when
[00:02:21] they come to the xmt
[00:02:24] live.com website where you can follow
[00:02:26] the entire championship in its entire in
[00:02:30] its detail you can see even exactly live
[00:02:33] what the Champions here are typing in
[00:02:36] what they memorize how fast they do that
[00:02:38] and when they make a mistake we even
[00:02:39] know when they make a mistake before
[00:02:41] they know yeah and there's a little
[00:02:42] delay so it's perfect exactly so but I
[00:02:45] want to go do a little preview of what
[00:02:46] just happened and what's going on in
[00:02:48] this tournament so there are seven
[00:02:50] Germans there are five people from
[00:02:53] Mongolia what is seven Germans now every
[00:02:55] time I I think about it's like getting
[00:02:57] more
[00:02:58] Germans
[00:03:00] there's four from the US there's four
[00:03:02] four from UK two from Sweden and one
[00:03:06] from the Philippines and one from the
[00:03:07] Netherlands right yeah actually it's
[00:03:10] interesting when when we think about
[00:03:12] this there have always been very strong
[00:03:15] German team and a very strong UK team
[00:03:18] because this sport developed itself in
[00:03:22] the united in the United Kingdom first
[00:03:25] where it was very small sport at stars
[00:03:29] and all the Chang came from there and
[00:03:31] then it switched to Germany all the
[00:03:33] Champions Dominic O'Brien yes Dominic
[00:03:35] O'Brien later and then Andy Bell and and
[00:03:38] um Ben pritma who is here today he
[00:03:40] became the three times World memory
[00:03:42] champion and then it shifted to Germany
[00:03:45] because in Germany there was a huge
[00:03:47] media coverage over the years different
[00:03:50] shows different interviews and people
[00:03:52] were just more familiar with this than
[00:03:54] for example in the United States and now
[00:03:56] it's switching to more of the Asian
[00:03:58] countries exactly we have um Mongolian
[00:04:02] team here very strong Mongolian team we
[00:04:04] don't have anyone from China today sadly
[00:04:06] she bin was qualified but he couldn't
[00:04:08] make it because of Visa problems next
[00:04:11] year we'll get that straightened out we
[00:04:13] have we have I think the biggest team in
[00:04:14] the world comes from China we have
[00:04:17] already 100 registered athletes for the
[00:04:20] upcoming Hong Kong memory Championship
[00:04:23] after one day of opening the
[00:04:26] registrations yeah so it's huge huge
[00:04:29] huge thing there we heard rumors that
[00:04:32] the brain show the Super Brain show
[00:04:34] which uh in the United States is called
[00:04:35] the super human show is having over 100
[00:04:40] million people watching that in China
[00:04:43] alone yeah I heard about that I'm not
[00:04:44] sure if these numbers are accurate but
[00:04:46] it's definitely way off in a big in a
[00:04:48] big country like that it wouldn't come
[00:04:51] as a super surprise no but that's like a
[00:04:53] Super Bowl right there for us in the
[00:04:55] United States and then our and our
[00:04:57] people our athletes who are here today
[00:04:59] day they will there be treated there
[00:05:01] like Superstars people are jumping over
[00:05:03] fances to just get a glimpse and touch
[00:05:06] them and soon that will happen to people
[00:05:07] like Nelson and you know Alex Mullen and
[00:05:11] the US candidates right but remember
[00:05:14] everyone to go to extremem memory
[00:05:16] challenge.com take the challenge see how
[00:05:19] incredible your brain is maybe you might
[00:05:22] be the next Superstar let us quickly um
[00:05:25] tell our audience what this is about
[00:05:28] it's a um two-day memory challenge which
[00:05:32] is um being created by Dart NeuroScience
[00:05:36] the venue that we are here today and
[00:05:39] beautiful venue beautiful venue really
[00:05:41] beautiful place I'm here for the third
[00:05:43] time in a row and I I love it anyway
[00:05:47] they are trying to figure out what the
[00:05:49] memory is all about and who has a
[00:05:51] special memory and they don't look for
[00:05:52] memory athletes they really actually
[00:05:55] look for the average Joe and so me
[00:05:59] exactly I was thinking about you and and
[00:06:03] they want they want to find out how they
[00:06:05] can actually improve the memory with
[00:06:09] drugs and they want them researching the
[00:06:11] memory pill what kind of drugs we don't
[00:06:14] know not the recreational ones um the
[00:06:17] memory pill when they you eat it and
[00:06:19] then you have a better memory if that's
[00:06:22] ever going to exist I mean the way
[00:06:25] medicine is coming forward we can
[00:06:27] actually assume that at one day we just
[00:06:30] drop a pill and all of a sudden we
[00:06:32] remember everything this is not how
[00:06:34] memory techniques work we do it actually
[00:06:35] a little bit differently a just a little
[00:06:37] bit right so there is no doping so far
[00:06:41] at championships at least not that we
[00:06:43] are know that we know yeah we don't take
[00:06:45] doping tests right we don't take tests
[00:06:47] so but we also don't really know how to
[00:06:51] do that yet maybe some of the athletes
[00:06:53] are taking some Goo uh some goo pills
[00:06:57] and stuff like that well yeah they just
[00:06:58] started a testing for Aderall and
[00:07:01] certain Sports now right isn't that
[00:07:02] isn't there actually a thing that people
[00:07:04] that people start to take amphetamines
[00:07:06] to to make all nighters to study for
[00:07:08] that was me last night with all these
[00:07:10] cards all right don't say that out loud
[00:07:14] what I mean no did you all right but yes
[00:07:17] we this one this is this is not a normal
[00:07:20] cookie all right but we are onto the
[00:07:23] cards event right now what we are seeing
[00:07:27] here um on the screen right now are Katy
[00:07:30] cmode from the United Kingdom and melan
[00:07:34] Melanie holline from and Melanie just be
[00:07:36] Germany Melanie just beat Katie that
[00:07:39] looks pretty much like it uh Melanie got
[00:07:42] 52 seconds ktie 60 seconds but even
[00:07:46] besides that time KD has a lot of
[00:07:49] mistakes there so oh and Marlo just
[00:07:52] upset Christian uh he did in 29.2
[00:07:57] seconds and look at this right
[00:08:00] johanes looks like the winner right now
[00:08:02] but there's still time left let's go to
[00:08:04] table three right there as you can see
[00:08:07] we have four tables always at the same
[00:08:10] time at each table there are two
[00:08:13] athletes one against one this is a what
[00:08:16] is the what is the name of the
[00:08:18] championship style it's the same style
[00:08:20] for a championship that they use at the
[00:08:22] football World Cup or the European Super
[00:08:25] Bowl or no I mean the European one oh
[00:08:28] the European one the soccer World Cup oh
[00:08:30] my god um I forget we have a group
[00:08:33] system the World Cup yeah we have a
[00:08:35] group system six groups here and look at
[00:08:37] this they just shook hands because
[00:08:39] johannas just beat Johan exactly Johan
[00:08:42] johannas johannas so when you go on xmt
[00:08:45] life.com you can actually jump on your
[00:08:48] own between all these tables you see
[00:08:50] exactly what they type in what they
[00:08:52] write what they memorize when they make
[00:08:54] a mistake you have an overview of all
[00:08:56] the points they have in the different
[00:08:57] groups let's quickly fly over over our
[00:08:59] groups here when we um switch on my
[00:09:03] monitor we can see that in group a we
[00:09:07] have Johannes Malo in the lead who is
[00:09:09] the current number one in the world
[00:09:12] rankings and the traditional world
[00:09:13] rankings which are not associated with
[00:09:16] the xmt the extreme tourn where we are
[00:09:18] here at the moment um in group b we have
[00:09:22] Lance churot from the United States with
[00:09:25] um seven wins there he seemed very
[00:09:27] confident during the lunch break
[00:09:29] he's ready he's excit had a chance to
[00:09:31] talk to him he's excited he's very
[00:09:33] excited he's on a certain kind of high
[00:09:35] does he look um calm because I always
[00:09:39] get a feeling of him that he's a he's a
[00:09:41] bit I think he's a little surprised has
[00:09:43] some some nervousness yeah no he does
[00:09:45] he's a little surprised that he's at
[00:09:47] seven and two but he's trying to roll
[00:09:49] with it right and then we have group C
[00:09:52] with Simon Reinhardt who also got seven
[00:09:55] wins so far and then Group D with Yan
[00:09:58] alanu from Sweden with seven wins we
[00:10:01] have group E with pfia
[00:10:04] Adon um all seven wins he's from
[00:10:07] Mongolia and then in group F we have
[00:10:09] johanes Shu with eight wins and here is
[00:10:13] the master of disaster the the master of
[00:10:15] disaster the guy behind the extreme
[00:10:18] memory tournament Nelson Dallas four
[00:10:21] times us memory Champion he is a he's a
[00:10:25] um mountain climber with his nonprofit
[00:10:28] organization for memory where you are
[00:10:32] um collecting money for re Alzheimer
[00:10:35] research raising awareness exactly we
[00:10:37] both share the same sad history that we
[00:10:40] lost all three of us we all we all lost
[00:10:43] a grandparent yep um to that nasty
[00:10:47] disease and speaking speaking from
[00:10:50] experience I Al honestly I cannot
[00:10:52] imagine a more terrifying disease where
[00:10:56] the personality of a person is um Step
[00:10:59] byep fing way which is incredibly sad
[00:11:03] and ultimately even fatal yeah cuz your
[00:11:06] whole body is working and then it's just
[00:11:07] your mind exactly that ruins everything
[00:11:10] else it's horrible to see so many people
[00:11:13] not just the not just the person with it
[00:11:16] but the people around you know yeah
[00:11:18] exactly so please support Nelson and his
[00:11:19] Endeavors there and and follow his his
[00:11:22] climbing in the future I'm sure there
[00:11:23] will be many more cool things from from
[00:11:26] Nelson to see you were just on the Mount
[00:11:28] Everest
[00:11:29] in the world the a month ago yeah I was
[00:11:32] I just literally to the day I got back
[00:11:34] from Mount Everest were there for 2
[00:11:36] months I was there for two months and uh
[00:11:39] I didn't sum it unfortunately
[00:11:41] but nearly there nearly there was my
[00:11:44] third try I still haven't made it to the
[00:11:46] top it's forever this
[00:11:49] elusive you know part of the world but
[00:11:52] I've been close but not for me not close
[00:11:55] enough and you're a model too right
[00:11:57] excuse me you're not a model no what
[00:12:01] model citizen I thought you a hand model
[00:12:03] no not my hands I bite my
[00:12:06] nails um are we going are we' going into
[00:12:09] this right yeah we're in this we're this
[00:12:10] is I know what they went for this is
[00:12:13] names the names but Jan is uh one of the
[00:12:15] top guys at names here so is
[00:12:19] Boris right so at the scream right now
[00:12:22] Lance Lance too at table four at the
[00:12:23] screen right now we see Dr Boris Conrad
[00:12:26] from Germany on the left Knight and Clay
[00:12:28] knight from the un Kingdom exactly Boris
[00:12:31] was the finalist from last
[00:12:32] year and Clay draw a wild card this year
[00:12:36] because shein bin from China couldn't
[00:12:39] make it right so last minute clay got a
[00:12:41] ticket to the xmt because he was the
[00:12:45] next one on the um qualification
[00:12:47] attempts they're doing names and faces
[00:12:50] right now yeah now looking at these
[00:12:51] names how quickly do you memorize
[00:12:53] something in your brain with the spatial
[00:12:54] memory well so for names they don't
[00:12:57] necessarily use a Memory Palace a lot of
[00:13:00] them I mean I don't know anybody who
[00:13:01] uses a Memory Palace for names B do
[00:13:04] really yes he does yes interesting I
[00:13:07] feel like he always switches it up with
[00:13:08] everything it's not necessarily a good
[00:13:11] sign because he's not the best in he's
[00:13:12] not very good but I guess maybe he'd be
[00:13:14] worse if you didn't use that but most
[00:13:17] people will use the the person's face as
[00:13:19] kind of the anchor or the location that
[00:13:22] they're storing right picture on do you
[00:13:24] ever use TV
[00:13:26] characters um yeah of course if I think
[00:13:29] of if a name reminds me of a celebrity
[00:13:32] or a character that's instantly what I
[00:13:33] go with I saw a lot of Seinfeld
[00:13:35] characters like who they look like yeah
[00:13:37] who they look like but you're you're
[00:13:38] saying they remind me they remind me of
[00:13:41] okay got it no see I don't even look at
[00:13:45] their face like that I'll just look at
[00:13:46] it for some distinguishing feature oh
[00:13:49] wow and then the name is what reminds me
[00:13:51] of something okay so if the name was
[00:13:53] Jerry I think of Jerry Seinfeld but I
[00:13:55] attached to something I saw something
[00:13:57] like their smiles like
[00:14:00] that reminded you of who no that's just
[00:14:01] it's just like that's something that
[00:14:02] popped out Seinfeld is that what it
[00:14:07] was um do you ever do something like
[00:14:10] when you look at a at a face that when
[00:14:13] nothing sticks out where it's very
[00:14:15] symmetrical most case it's beautiful
[00:14:18] face beautiful faces tend to not have
[00:14:20] anything you perfect they're too perfect
[00:14:22] right they're actually
[00:14:24] very actually they're very
[00:14:26] counterproductive for a memory athlete
[00:14:28] we always always look for spots and
[00:14:30] scars and God damn you being so
[00:14:32] beautiful yeah so it's me it would be
[00:14:33] hard so what do you do then what do you
[00:14:35] then just pick something like you know
[00:14:37] honestly at this point when I meet
[00:14:40] people it's I don't search that much for
[00:14:43] some distinguishing feature I usually
[00:14:45] just choose something like a nose so I
[00:14:47] take your nose yeah whether it's big
[00:14:49] small crooked right warted wart
[00:14:53] filed bleeding know fil yeah like a
[00:14:58] witch sounds nice remember up at the top
[00:15:00] go to extrem memory challenge.com oh
[00:15:03] yeah I that's an interesting test uh I
[00:15:06] think at the end you get to compare
[00:15:07] yourself to how I did on that test
[00:15:09] really yeah oh look at this 28 points
[00:15:12] for Yan Henrik he's really killing it in
[00:15:14] this
[00:15:15] discipline um and he came but Johan
[00:15:18] stole his time Don in the wrong spot I
[00:15:20] couldn't remember Don but johannas
[00:15:21] always takes his time the the the
[00:15:24] current world record for names is 28 so
[00:15:28] he just and what was it no it was 29 oh
[00:15:32] no that's from that's from last year 29
[00:15:35] is from from 2 years ago that's still
[00:15:37] fine right still the record by Simon
[00:15:40] right yes Simon Reinhardt is is holding
[00:15:43] that um now he got
[00:15:45] 29 oh now he got 29 wow what was the
[00:15:49] time on the seconds on the world record
[00:15:53] I think it was under 60 seconds also 60
[00:15:54] seconds you know I think it's the food
[00:15:56] it's the break that helped him yeah
[00:15:58] fresh it's a long day it is a long day
[00:16:01] he ate a bag up he put Dawn in two slots
[00:16:04] so maybe I mean he must be aware of that
[00:16:06] he put Dawn there in two slots so he
[00:16:09] still has 90 seconds left to plenty of
[00:16:12] time figure out that Ricky is not
[00:16:17] done what else do we have here so Lance
[00:16:21] is a pretty good score Lance is still in
[00:16:23] how many how many names are in this in
[00:16:25] this database of names that you guys use
[00:16:27] here yeah um I I think head shot there's
[00:16:30] over well over a thousand um Simon knows
[00:16:32] the exact number Simon Orton and then
[00:16:35] the names database I think it's close to
[00:16:38] 2,000 all right so someone who's
[00:16:41] creating a pre-made image for all these
[00:16:44] 2,000 imag might have an advantage yeah
[00:16:47] but that won't happen um especially
[00:16:49] since we have the training website where
[00:16:53] I think the set is even less um and then
[00:16:56] we've changed the database of names uh
[00:17:00] for the competition all right and then
[00:17:02] you change it back after the competition
[00:17:04] or you keep it like that 30 seconds we
[00:17:06] would probably keep it in all right we
[00:17:08] are close to see a new world record in
[00:17:11] the
[00:17:12] names discipline by Yan isn't the time
[00:17:16] ban someone did it in a short amount of
[00:17:18] time no I think Simon did it in the
[00:17:21] let's see the names
[00:17:24] 52 where do you see that
[00:17:27] JN 29 all right all right that was
[00:17:30] that's from today that was from today
[00:17:32] and Katy also 29 we are really need to
[00:17:35] keep up our we're
[00:17:38] fired our game here these
[00:17:41] people completed all right
[00:17:43] congratulations 29 he just went even
[00:17:46] with Katie and Yan now we have three new
[00:17:50] world records by Wonder Katy kod from
[00:17:53] the UK Yan alanu from Sweden and Yan
[00:17:57] Henrik bshop from Germany all with 29
[00:17:59] names in 60 seconds which is you
[00:18:02] incredible why do you guys think people
[00:18:03] are getting stronger in this competition
[00:18:05] every year it's it's I I have a I have a
[00:18:08] very easy theory for that is it getting
[00:18:10] used to it or they see the record and
[00:18:12] they train harder yeah yeah that's
[00:18:14] that's just first year I mean they were
[00:18:16] creating the records now there's
[00:18:18] distinct benchmarks right it's like they
[00:18:20] want to go higher than that it's like if
[00:18:22] you're doing some skill just on your own
[00:18:25] and then suddenly you know between
[00:18:27] friends there's a mark
[00:18:29] right and you're like okay then you
[00:18:30] suddenly eventually will touch or beat
[00:18:33] that Mark and then it's kind of this
[00:18:35] Captain Mouse game exactly but then when
[00:18:37] somebody gets to 30 it's about the time
[00:18:39] now yeah then they will try to beat the
[00:18:41] time exactly and you have seen this in
[00:18:43] memory Sports since since I have started
[00:18:46] with it in 2003 there was always a
[00:18:49] certain level you're that old and that
[00:18:53] and that level has
[00:18:55] been constantly being increased in
[00:18:58] increase increase increase so for
[00:18:59] example speed cards there was a 33
[00:19:03] seconds world record by Ben pritmore uh
[00:19:06] 10 years ago and this has been now
[00:19:10] lowered and lower 21 seconds now right
[00:19:13] 20 seconds. 44 into the traditional
[00:19:15] events but we have already seen today a
[00:19:18] much faster time by Alex mull he did 193
[00:19:22] seconds doesn't you say wow that's
[00:19:24] impressive and he and they can do more
[00:19:26] than that so this is you cannot compare
[00:19:28] this to a physical sport where they run
[00:19:30] the 100 met and then um the next guy who
[00:19:33] breaks the world record slightly beats
[00:19:35] the previous world record by a hundreds
[00:19:38] of a like thousands of a second yeah
[00:19:41] eventually but we are still not there
[00:19:43] yet they they still break the records by
[00:19:46] many seconds or with a lot of more
[00:19:50] digits or a lot of more names that they
[00:19:51] squeeze in depending on what kind of
[00:19:53] discipline you have so it's all about to
[00:19:55] see what others did before and as soon
[00:19:59] as you have that then you want to beat
[00:20:01] that and the Brain seems to be so um
[00:20:05] flexible when it comes to that that
[00:20:09] you're actually uh all of a sudden able
[00:20:12] to break that record although before
[00:20:14] that for a long time the bar was much
[00:20:16] much lower exactly it seemed impossible
[00:20:18] but all of a sudden people do it and one
[00:20:21] one person does it and then more people
[00:20:24] come and and do the same and they put
[00:20:26] the bar higher and higher so we are not
[00:20:28] that point yet in memory Sports history
[00:20:30] where we really are at the end of
[00:20:32] possibilities yeah going going off that
[00:20:35] where do you see xmt in let's say five
[00:20:37] years that's a good question I will
[00:20:39] answer it let's just watch this little
[00:20:40] speedrun here I'm curious to see
[00:20:44] um some of these guys going we have a
[00:20:47] lot of matches here that are people who
[00:20:49] are really good at numbers against
[00:20:51] people who are not so good at numbers
[00:20:52] who's who do you think's not Lance is
[00:20:54] good Boris is good Ben is good and
[00:20:57] Johannes is good
[00:20:59] although cc is kind staying up there
[00:21:02] yeah this is really impressive to see
[00:21:04] this to see this level bar like this
[00:21:07] download bar on the right hand on the
[00:21:09] xmt so johanes in seconds I think that's
[00:21:13] a record yeah this is so amazing I'm so
[00:21:17] happy that I can do the 80 digits now in
[00:21:19] 60 seconds that was like the milestone
[00:21:21] for me and it's not it's not easy he
[00:21:23] does the same in a third of the time I
[00:21:24] mean I'm fast with that I know I know
[00:21:26] that with this speed um
[00:21:30] 99.9% of the people in the world that
[00:21:32] cannot do that even with training but
[00:21:36] yet this guy is doing it three more than
[00:21:38] three times faster this is so impressive
[00:21:40] and he's blowing out the competition
[00:21:42] right now I think the next guy is 8
[00:21:43] seconds after him exactly imagine
[00:21:46] someone doing that in physical Sports
[00:21:48] and was like flying over the
[00:21:50] track if yanas can put this together
[00:21:53] that's incredible we haven't had a sub
[00:21:56] 202 um run of numbers done he has a
[00:21:59] record at
[00:22:01] 2101 and marwin did 21 something earlier
[00:22:06] today but nobody's broken 20 seconds
[00:22:08] yeah let's let's see what oh he had
[00:22:09] already typed in the first mistake there
[00:22:13] but that doesn't necessarily mean that
[00:22:14] you cannot fix it in in the end it's a
[00:22:17] little off though maybe he's just
[00:22:20] playing with the audience yeah he does
[00:22:22] that for us us yeah exactly I'll give
[00:22:25] him a little thing to worry about and
[00:22:27] just changed at the last minute he's got
[00:22:30] to look how quickly he's I know just
[00:22:31] filling in the rest so why is he wearing
[00:22:33] those glasses we were wondering like the
[00:22:35] clear ones they're not really they're
[00:22:37] not really helping so much I honestly he
[00:22:39] just wears it to look really cool yeah
[00:22:41] look really smart yeah work it's it
[00:22:44] gives him a it gives him this look of of
[00:22:47] of Scott from from the X-Men a little
[00:22:50] bit who has this laser
[00:22:53] eye then Yan Hendrick he's just chilling
[00:22:56] which in case you're wondering he does
[00:22:57] not have have Las their eyes I was
[00:22:59] wondering why do you have to spoil the
[00:23:01] fun man he took them off he doesn't he
[00:23:04] took them he took the glasses off and
[00:23:06] now we are we lost the the signal and
[00:23:09] here we back it was just an
[00:23:10] advertisement for that was an advertis
[00:23:13] we should we should get some there and
[00:23:15] his was memory card I mean right that
[00:23:18] kind of fits the topic we have 2 minutes
[00:23:20] and 30 seconds of
[00:23:24] recall so yanas is so Ben won 28
[00:23:29] seconds Lance won again he's blowing out
[00:23:32] the
[00:23:33] competition he's on a roll I mean it's
[00:23:35] it's going to be neck and neck with
[00:23:36] Boris and Lance yeah um in the
[00:23:41] standings well Boris could still
[00:23:45] lose yep it's true I mean there's
[00:23:48] there's still a lot of room
[00:23:51] for for everyone to lose their positions
[00:23:54] more or less except for I guess KT is
[00:23:57] pretty much much secure but some of
[00:24:00] these some of these athletes who are in
[00:24:02] back they're nervous too they don't have
[00:24:04] much they don't have many points before
[00:24:07] the others so Lance sitting Indian style
[00:24:10] right
[00:24:11] now right whatever makes him comfortable
[00:24:14] makes him memorize faster exactly I
[00:24:17] remember I remember we have we have seen
[00:24:19] many many funny things on on memory
[00:24:22] competitions Clemens Meer used to uh
[00:24:25] this is the world memory champion from
[00:24:27] 20 five and six he used to first German
[00:24:29] Champion yeah exactly he used to put the
[00:24:32] table to the wall so that he was facing
[00:24:35] the wall where the entire other um group
[00:24:38] of of memory athletes were just facing
[00:24:40] to the front he couldn't interesting he
[00:24:42] couldn't stand that he was also to
[00:24:44] taking off his shoes and then he he was
[00:24:46] he was no no no he was he brought
[00:24:48] himself these slippers yeah he had these
[00:24:51] comfortable slippers for um for for for
[00:24:55] the memorizing events interesting
[00:24:56] someone was wearing sers I think it was
[00:24:58] Lance yeah Lance had had the he had the
[00:25:01] Chinese Hotel slippers that we had from
[00:25:03] the world championship last year another
[00:25:06] hilarious thing was um yonas from Essen
[00:25:09] who who always used to take off his
[00:25:10] shoes and then he had two different
[00:25:12] kinds of socks it was like his trademark
[00:25:14] two different kinds of colored socks
[00:25:16] striped colored socks really cool I like
[00:25:19] it a lot uh well well Ben who is here he
[00:25:22] is the man with the hat he always has
[00:25:24] his hat and he has the zoomi t-shirt
[00:25:26] that we mentioned earlier look at this
[00:25:28] yanas 25 seconds yeah well he's going to
[00:25:31] fill clay just toass Boris wow he just
[00:25:35] pass that a big upset if that Happ that
[00:25:38] is a that is a
[00:25:40] point well not it's not too it's not too
[00:25:43] bad for Boris he has already 21 points
[00:25:46] there in his group and anudari who's
[00:25:48] following him has only nine so doesn't
[00:25:50] make huge difference to him go let's
[00:25:53] tune in to see his reaction here exactly
[00:25:55] maybe we can switch to the um
[00:25:58] to Boris again well it's it's already up
[00:26:01] there
[00:26:02] so um and we lost we lost the video feed
[00:26:07] from that camera for a
[00:26:10] moment it's okay right wow big
[00:26:15] upset yeah so how Lance just won
[00:26:18] to because of his time and that puts
[00:26:22] Lance into a really good position he's
[00:26:25] qualified for tomorrow Lance has the has
[00:26:28] the most points so far after 11 matches
[00:26:30] he's in the lead with 27 points there in
[00:26:33] his group followed by Boris with 21 and
[00:26:36] then clay an odari both um nine points
[00:26:40] which puts Lance and Boris in a huge
[00:26:43] huge advantage in the group yeah and so
[00:26:46] he's he's solidified his his position
[00:26:48] tomorrow he could lose every match oh
[00:26:50] yeah Lance Lance is not first one to be
[00:26:52] qualified for tomorrow right there been
[00:26:54] indicated for everyone out there who
[00:26:56] wonders how do we know that when you
[00:26:57] click on the on the xmt live.com website
[00:27:00] and you go on the groups overview you
[00:27:02] will now see in group b Lance is the
[00:27:05] first one that has this what is that
[00:27:08] this this this that's green right that
[00:27:11] green bluish um color that indicates
[00:27:14] that he's already qualified are you
[00:27:16] color blind he no I I don't know I guess
[00:27:19] it depends on some alternate color yeah
[00:27:22] just a different color it's a different
[00:27:24] blue than the other so why should he
[00:27:27] still stay in this if he already
[00:27:29] advanced well because now he wants to
[00:27:31] now it's a matter of um who does he play
[00:27:35] tomorrow so the higher ranked you are
[00:27:38] the the more chance you're going to play
[00:27:39] Someone easier uh on day
[00:27:43] two now let's see so if he wins Group B
[00:27:46] uh let's he will face group CF third
[00:27:49] place third place let's say
[00:27:53] CF which would at the moment be either s
[00:27:59] everu or Marlo Knight which is a lot
[00:28:03] better than say he was second
[00:28:05] place you'd have to
[00:28:07] play um let's see Group
[00:28:10] B where's Group B runner up we play
[00:28:13] group E
[00:28:15] winner who's in group E Yeah so Pro job
[00:28:19] or Katie you don't want that yeah no
[00:28:22] right so he still needs to fight yeah W
[00:28:24] so what's nice is he could maybe
[00:28:27] especially if he maybe wins a few more
[00:28:28] matches he could start to maybe really
[00:28:30] try some awesome scores and that $2,000
[00:28:33] for the day exactly and he has the skill
[00:28:35] to do so he does in all of the
[00:28:37] disciplines in every single one he can
[00:28:39] be extremely good I mean we both called
[00:28:41] that both said that he studied a lot he
[00:28:43] was memorizing yeah he's taking this
[00:28:46] he's taking this more serious than any
[00:28:49] of the other memory athletes that we
[00:28:50] have here today yeah so out of the 24
[00:28:53] competitors Lance is certainly the one
[00:28:55] who is giving it all
[00:28:57] yep unfortunately though he's already
[00:28:59] done all his card matches so what he has
[00:29:02] left are images names and words wow well
[00:29:06] but I have seen him on Facebook um oh
[00:29:09] perfect publishing these perfect names
[00:29:12] and I think he also did perfect words in
[00:29:15] training Here Comes Alex Table Three
[00:29:19] yeah here we see the current world
[00:29:20] memory champion on the left at table
[00:29:23] three
[00:29:24] facing the J Al from Sweden who is also
[00:29:30] doing incredibly good there today she
[00:29:33] has 21 points in her group if Alex wins
[00:29:35] this match um he will probably surpass
[00:29:39] her the recall is off by 01 but I'm
[00:29:43] assuming if he other the way he can make
[00:29:45] up for that in that match now yeah yeah
[00:29:47] that's true or not it could he could
[00:29:49] also win with it not being I mean both
[00:29:52] of them with nearly 92% accuracy that's
[00:29:56] that's just incredible monsters at word
[00:29:58] so it'll be interesting to see can we go
[00:30:00] to table
[00:30:02] one it's another big matchup between
[00:30:06] Marin and Simon AR we oh no that's
[00:30:08] that's Table Three that's Table Three
[00:30:10] there we go all
[00:30:12] right look at those two handsome fellas
[00:30:15] yes ready to explode their minds all
[00:30:19] over this match that is
[00:30:24] disgusting we have 30 seconds of
[00:30:26] memorizing and then we shall do our
[00:30:31] recall all right yeah this is here we
[00:30:36] see my guess for the for the winner
[00:30:39] tomorrow so far he's actually struggling
[00:30:42] a little bit but he's doing really good
[00:30:44] Marvin is at the moment position number
[00:30:46] two this is another one if marwin wins
[00:30:48] he could be move ahead of Simon right
[00:30:51] and it would be very good it would be
[00:30:53] very good for him
[00:30:54] because like we just figured out with
[00:30:56] Lance if he's at the top position of his
[00:30:58] group he will face a well less higher
[00:31:02] ranked third from the first day it
[00:31:04] doesn't necessar mean that it's a that's
[00:31:06] a weaker opponent but chances are that
[00:31:10] that's actually the case and here we go
[00:31:12] with the words both of them memorizing
[00:31:14] two words at at the same time that means
[00:31:16] they they combine these two words and
[00:31:19] they create this cluster image that they
[00:31:21] put on one of their locations in the
[00:31:23] Memory
[00:31:24] Palace and Simon was the first one in
[00:31:27] the world to get really crazy scores in
[00:31:30] with words actually no it's not true
[00:31:32] Boris was the first one who got really
[00:31:33] good scores and then Simon came out of
[00:31:37] the out of the blue and Sur P passed him
[00:31:39] and Boris struggled ever since
[00:31:42] to yeah to get there again and in the
[00:31:45] meantime all these other competitors
[00:31:47] came who just got super good at that
[00:31:49] everyone's taking their time right now
[00:31:50] they taking the full 60 seconds just to
[00:31:53] make sure that they got it this is the
[00:31:55] first time wow all oh no Simon 55.3 s
[00:32:00] seconds sneaky and Alex another sneaky
[00:32:03] guy 56.
[00:32:07] 56 and Marvin takes the time to review
[00:32:10] his material he's not he's not typing
[00:32:12] Simon is already typing like crazy there
[00:32:16] and here comes Marvin as well now he
[00:32:17] starts uh Marvin is memorizing in
[00:32:21] Swedish Simon in German so everyone out
[00:32:24] there who's wondering what's going on
[00:32:26] there all translate for us yeah so uh um
[00:32:31] let's see cple words first the first
[00:32:33] word I don't know in English the T that
[00:32:35] means action something like U when you
[00:32:38] killed someone that's the for
[00:32:41] example murder no no no no it's more
[00:32:44] complex oh look at this he's doing the
[00:32:46] same thing that we saw earlier with
[00:32:48] Katie he's just typing in the first few
[00:32:51] letters and Simon but yeah he always
[00:32:53] starts from the bottom and then moves
[00:32:55] the top yeah so he gives himself he
[00:32:58] gives
[00:32:58] himself
[00:33:00] um a little a little reminder by just
[00:33:03] typing in the first letters and then he
[00:33:04] comes back to it later so now it looks
[00:33:06] all red but later he will fix that just
[00:33:09] from meeting marwin he seems like he's a
[00:33:11] very serious guy he is he is yeah he's
[00:33:15] he's not he just comes and he wants to
[00:33:17] get the job done he's not really joking
[00:33:19] around a lot he just he's just take he
[00:33:21] just takes it very serious and I mean of
[00:33:24] of course we all enjoy someone who funny
[00:33:27] but I mean I also I also like this
[00:33:29] attitude of his because he really he
[00:33:31] really wants to make this happen and
[00:33:33] it's like a Michael Jordan
[00:33:34] attitude yeah I mean he doesn't he
[00:33:37] doesn't he doesn't care about um just
[00:33:40] just playing around he wants he wants he
[00:33:43] wants this really badly
[00:33:45] and doesn't look bad he made a little
[00:33:48] mistake there and he has two Miss S sim
[00:33:53] just killing it he's going forward he
[00:33:55] has something he puts something in there

[00:34:03] little reminders it looks really
[00:34:06] good it looks really
[00:34:09] good oh now he's now he's switching it
[00:34:12] no no no no no there you go so to
[00:34:16] translate a couple more words that we
[00:34:17] see here we have
[00:34:19] surround we have uh Carpenter we have
[00:34:24] adjust how do you say adjust and unpas
[00:34:28] UNP UNP UNP tap right to I don't know
[00:34:33] what that even is even a German I know
[00:34:35] that the key here is called tabulator
[00:34:38] it's called tab what was that first word
[00:34:41] TD that's um that's a thing that you did
[00:34:47] and it's it's often related to a murder
[00:34:50] scene for example but it doesn't but it
[00:34:51] doesn't necessarily mean murder um it
[00:34:55] means any action that you did in
[00:34:57] in the past oh oh but it's not an action
[00:35:00] it's a
[00:35:01] noun I don't know what this is called
[00:35:03] Engish look at Alex Table Three spinning
[00:35:08] janja just making minc meat of
[00:35:15] her what is she wearing is that a
[00:35:18] visor it's a makeshift cardboard is

[00:35:24] that's you can you can clearly see the
[00:35:26] barcode
[00:35:27] hanging there from the side I think it's
[00:35:29] done on purpose to mimic the fact but
[00:35:32] she always she always comes with funny
[00:35:34] stuff like that oh last last year she
[00:35:37] had this huge summer summer head that
[00:35:40] she put very far down to her
[00:35:44] face um comeing look at this Simon did
[00:35:47] it he cracked it wow he cracked it well
[00:35:51] what was the record it was 5 let us let
[00:35:52] us switch back to Simon Reinhard who's
[00:35:54] now breaking the were no wasn't it
[00:35:57] already broken it was it was broken by
[00:36:00] 55 by ktie Katy already got this earlier

[00:36:06] her no but the Tim is yeah oh 55 yeah
[00:36:10] yeah really that was 55.3 slightly below
[00:36:13] her that's the new world record
[00:36:14] congratulations Simon and he is veryy
[00:36:17] look at him he is very red in his face
[00:36:21] and wow can we get a closeup yeah hey
[00:36:24] Marvin doesn't really know what what to
[00:36:26] say there he's um Angels getting a
[00:36:28] picture of him he didn't he didn't have
[00:36:30] a chance to a close-up shot a little
[00:36:33] fist bu it was more like fist fist to
[00:36:36] Elbow but oh there was a that was a nice
[00:36:39] clapping there from from Marvin there
[00:36:40] was and Marvin yeah he smiled yeah I
[00:36:44] mean Marvin what Marvin
[00:36:47] knows being up against Simon and this
[00:36:50] really difficult discipline wow that was
[00:36:53] amazing I just can't believe this guy
[00:36:55] learned all the memory techniques from
[00:36:58] Boris from his I know that from his EXL
[00:37:01] Memory Trainer thing oh right 10 years
[00:37:03] ago he found it and he if I were Boris
[00:37:07] I'd be like damn it no he beat like the
[00:37:11] record on there and they he thought it
[00:37:12] was a are you mean the memor L trainer
[00:37:15] yeah yeah yeah right this is this from
[00:37:17] our from our memory Club in Germany we
[00:37:19] had we were the First Once who had this
[00:37:22] who had this this digital software
[00:37:25] actually I aage software digital isn't
[00:37:27] the software with um couple of these
[00:37:30] games that we that we do here and Dr
[00:37:32] Boris created it well no it's not true
[00:37:34] he didn't I think maybe he was involved
[00:37:37] in that but it came from it came from
[00:37:39] the club and I don't know I don't want
[00:37:42] to give wrong information it doesn't
[00:37:44] matter fighting it's good people want
[00:37:47] people want us to fight we need to get
[00:37:49] more physical
[00:37:51] here all right cool that is another
[00:37:55] world record that we saw he today there
[00:37:57] were several now there were several now
[00:38:00] in different
[00:38:02] disciplines uh Marvin was Marvin was
[00:38:06] very close to the world record in digits
[00:38:08] there yeah he nearly cracked it but he
[00:38:11] was like a quarter three quarters of a
[00:38:14] second too slow how did Katie's recall
[00:38:19] percentage go down that much it was at
[00:38:20] 98 before the lunch
[00:38:22] break that's right only one event I
[00:38:25] think that brought her down let's have a
[00:38:27] look well we can go on matches type in
[00:38:30] ktie and we will see which one she
[00:38:31] messed up so
[00:38:34] horribly right so here with the cards
[00:38:36] she only managed 34 20 cards that's
[00:38:39] pretty
[00:38:40] much it's pretty much it the the match
[00:38:44] card match number 106 against Melanie
[00:38:48] she just got 20 out of 52 that's wow
[00:38:51] that really that really screwed up her
[00:38:52] statistics
[00:38:54] there guys I'm going to leave you I'm
[00:38:56] going to head back back into the all
[00:38:58] right talk to you later me we'll be back
[00:39:01] that was the supermodel Nelson delis
[00:39:04] four-time us memory Champion I thought
[00:39:06] he was a hand model you know what let's
[00:39:08] just leave it at
[00:39:12] that all right so what is this what are
[00:39:15] we look what are we looking at here this
[00:39:16] is guys remember to go to extreme memory
[00:39:19] challenge.com
[00:39:20] that's right extreme memory
[00:39:22] challenge.com and we are now looking at
[00:39:27] maravin against Simon Johnny against s s
[00:39:30] yra against Alex and Everett against
[00:39:34] Shir and it seems like they have already
[00:39:37] they have already memorized in the
[00:39:38] meantime again while we were talking
[00:39:40] they were already memorizing the next
[00:39:41] bunch of data that's typical right yeah
[00:39:45] look at that yra did in 49.88
[00:39:50] seconds see what the world record
[00:39:53] is so names what what is what is the
[00:39:56] this here yeah yeah yeah what is this
[00:39:58] there are two names on Simon oh wow yeah
[00:40:02] did he put two names in
[00:40:04] there I think he did Virginia he's got
[00:40:08] to delete can he he needs to delete
[00:40:10] Shirley and he'll get it right that
[00:40:13] looks strange but yeah
[00:40:16] exactly but so the world record for
[00:40:19] names right
[00:40:20] now
[00:40:22] is 29 names in
[00:40:25] 52.63% by jja yeah so that means own
[00:40:28] record no one has yet cracked this is
[00:40:31] the last discipline that has not been
[00:40:32] cracked yet all the other disciplines
[00:40:34] it's now about the time yeah yeah
[00:40:36] because the amount of information is
[00:40:38] always fixed we have 80 digits for the
[00:40:40] for the numbers we have uh 30 images we
[00:40:43] have 30 names which the only one not
[00:40:47] being correct yet we have 50 words and
[00:40:49] we have like 52 cards at one deck of
[00:40:52] poker cards and all except for the words
[00:40:55] except for the the names have been now
[00:40:58] all the information been memorized in 60
[00:41:01] seconds or
[00:41:03] less so pretty damn well right now 22
[00:41:07] names and she's got two minutes to
[00:41:09] recall yeah especially look at her time
[00:41:12] yeah incredible this is aord an
[00:41:15] incredible time hopefully 49 seconds um
[00:41:20] probably too fast for her because we can
[00:41:22] already see several mistakes that don't
[00:41:24] really look like she will figure them
[00:41:27] out but she's very flashy it's with her
[00:41:31] numbers and with her style yeah I like
[00:41:34] it yeah
[00:41:37] absolutely I think what fascinate
[00:41:40] fascinates me the most is that we have
[00:41:43] so strong female competitors who are um
[00:41:48] who don't have to hide against all these
[00:41:50] male competitors not in not like in
[00:41:53] physical Sports where you can put them
[00:41:54] together because it would be would
[00:41:56] create an disadvantage to the females
[00:41:58] because the male body is can run faster
[00:42:02] lift more weights I don't know anymore
[00:42:05] there's some women out there of course I
[00:42:07] mean I don't I don't want to yeah I
[00:42:09] don't want to put up against against
[00:42:11] really female athlete there but in
[00:42:13] general of course thing right and here
[00:42:16] that's not a thing so all all you girls
[00:42:18] and women out there please please come
[00:42:20] and you can win a lot of money here you
[00:42:22] can prove that you have a brilliant mind
[00:42:24] even if you think you have a bad memory
[00:42:25] at
[00:42:26] exactly come learn the techniques and
[00:42:29] you can
[00:42:30] beat all these gentlemen here and
[00:42:34] remember go to extremem memory
[00:42:37] challenge.com
[00:42:38] take the test right take the challenge
[00:42:42] do it it's easy it's just a click away
[00:42:45] exactly you will help our sponsor dark
[00:42:47] Neuroscience here to create the um the
[00:42:52] the biggest you want a super brain in
[00:42:55] the world human brain we could have that
[00:42:58] yeah we could if you take this test so
[00:43:00] 18 seconds left but let's go to Alex
[00:43:02] Mullen so he's got some answers right
[00:43:04] here he has pretty hard it's Janie but
[00:43:06] he put Janice and then he has Debbie but
[00:43:09] he has he spelled Debbie incorrectly all
[00:43:11] right pretty close with some of these
[00:43:13] something was off with his Christopher
[00:43:15] as well I don't really see what but it
[00:43:17] looks like missing a t there looks like
[00:43:19] he just won that times up oh look at
[00:43:22] that man that was so close just the same
[00:43:25] score the two them had there but Simon
[00:43:28] wins again because he did it in
[00:43:30] 56.5 seconds that's actually a pretty
[00:43:32] interesting number that he got there I
[00:43:35] like
[00:43:36] it all right and yeah where janja
[00:43:39] couldn't get through with her 4 49
[00:43:41] seconds there Alex betterer with two
[00:43:43] more I feel bad for marwin cuz Simon is
[00:43:46] such a tough competitor to play against
[00:43:48] and he did very well yeah I mean I don't
[00:43:51] feel bad for him because Simon is one of
[00:43:54] the best
[00:43:56] the
[00:43:58] and Marvin is doing a good job there and
[00:44:00] it doesn't mean
[00:44:01] anything he's if he ends up second in
[00:44:04] his group we will have to face another
[00:44:07] tough guy tomorrow but Marvin is one of
[00:44:09] the best as well so he doesn't have to
[00:44:11] hide it doesn't really matter show up
[00:44:13] and beat him he can he can compete
[00:44:15] against anyone and he has the
[00:44:17] possibility to win he probably just had
[00:44:19] a bad moment right now or Simon Simon
[00:44:22] might be better who knows right but he
[00:44:24] he probably doesn't have to f Simon
[00:44:26] again maybe Simon is losing the what are
[00:44:29] they called the Octo finals tomorrow do
[00:44:31] we have actually octo finals I think we
[00:44:33] do round yeah it's called round of 16
[00:44:36] they don't call it octo finals oo uh
[00:44:39] they they call quarter final sem round
[00:44:42] of 16 exactly so this is I just want to
[00:44:45] give a shout out to our production crew
[00:44:48] did an amazing job today it's a lot of
[00:44:50] work they put into this for the past
[00:44:52] months that's true y that's true U
[00:44:54] couple months thank you very much much
[00:44:56] to Nick and Pete and to our camera guys
[00:44:59] I know we were not supposed to say the
[00:45:00] names because no one out there knows now
[00:45:02] their address is
[00:45:04] 237 San Diego Drive ever Evergreen
[00:45:07] Terrace
[00:45:08] yeah um no it's really cool I we can
[00:45:12] consider ourselves so lucky to work with
[00:45:14] them and um make this make this happen
[00:45:17] when they when they came back to me I
[00:45:18] was like look at this fantastic screen
[00:45:20] that we have we have the xmt logo there
[00:45:22] in the back that's us that's you that's
[00:45:24] me man yeah and that's my my brother he
[00:45:26] designed this logo it's a beautiful logo
[00:45:29] yeah yeah and yep and right here too if
[00:45:33] you want to buy these t-shirts I don't
[00:45:34] know how you can but maybe soon they
[00:45:36] will cuz these are absolutely gorgeous
[00:45:38] they will be soft only $89 on the xmt
[00:45:42] web yeah right no no no no we don't know
[00:45:44] how much they are going to be sold for
[00:45:46] but seriously buy one no I like I like
[00:45:48] the color actually this is they're so
[00:45:49] soft they're really soft aren't they
[00:45:51] really soft let's come back to memory
[00:45:53] Sports all right so now we are on to the
[00:45:55] the cards for group E we have
[00:46:00] fuj right group E and group F yep so um
[00:46:05] let's let's have a quick look at those
[00:46:06] two groups we
[00:46:08] have Pia and Katy both had tohe
[00:46:13] seven uh seven wins both of them by the
[00:46:16] way is there already now the um the new
[00:46:19] match from ktie that she was missing
[00:46:21] earlier before the they did they did
[00:46:23] that they did all right I think that's
[00:46:25] the one she didn't not do well so
[00:46:27] basically off guard yeah basically what
[00:46:29] it looks like is that's they already did
[00:46:31] nine out of 15 matches that leaves them
[00:46:35] six matches in that in group E and
[00:46:38] that's 6times three that's 18 so there's
[00:46:42] still a possibility that um Melanie and
[00:46:45] westle are winning but they have only
[00:46:48] one more chance and this is they need to
[00:46:49] win every single match from now on if
[00:46:51] they win if they lose one more match yep
[00:46:54] they um they will be out and perov and
[00:46:56] KT both will qualify immediately to the
[00:47:00] next round 24 I'm looking at well maybe
[00:47:04] yeah I mean immediately the the last the
[00:47:06] last remaining thing that would stop
[00:47:08] them would be the the accuracy but even
[00:47:10] in that I'm rooting for Old Man Rivers
[00:47:12] from KD are in the lead I'm I'm rooting
[00:47:15] for Old Man Rivers Marlo Knight you know
[00:47:17] he if he wins this he's five and five
[00:47:20] and he has a chance he has 15 points
[00:47:22] right he's 48 let's root for this guy
[00:47:25] come on he
[00:47:26] Marlo is really impressive because he is
[00:47:28] also he's also really much in love with
[00:47:30] memory Sports and he he practices very
[00:47:33] regular and he's going around the world
[00:47:35] and he goes to different championships
[00:47:37] and he's very active in the memory scene
[00:47:39] and uh he's just just very impressive I
[00:47:42] mean
[00:47:44] 48
[00:47:46] um with at that age normally you
[00:47:48] probably don't bother with a competitive
[00:47:51] sport anymore right and and now here we
[00:47:53] are in memory Sports and you can do that
[00:47:56] easily in your spare time yeah you come
[00:47:58] you come home after a long day of work
[00:48:00] and you sit down and you memorize a
[00:48:02] little bit for 20 minutes and you're
[00:48:04] still doing a really good job for your
[00:48:05] brain and it stren yeah strengthens your
[00:48:07] brain keep yourself competitive at a
[00:48:08] really high level exactly all right I
[00:48:12] think after this tournament I'm going to
[00:48:13] start training not kidding yeah and you
[00:48:16] might be my
[00:48:17] coach memory sports.com you can come to
[00:48:20] my website and I can show you everything
[00:48:22] you need I I have got all interviews
[00:48:25] he's got videos everything on his
[00:48:27] website most importantly I have the
[00:48:28] really cool training material but let us
[00:48:31] concentrate here on what what puji and
[00:48:35] ktie are doing our two top competitors
[00:48:38] in group E but look at Johan at
[00:48:54] 24.74%
[00:48:56] but on the other hand Maro doesn't
[00:48:58] really want to lose either he's on rank
[00:49:00] three right now so it's kind of look at
[00:49:03] this is nearly done he's nearly done
[00:49:06] with his 42 seconds and that look this
[00:49:09] that will 52 cards and 42. 74 seconds oh
[00:49:14] yeah he's done he's done he's done ktie
[00:49:16] has is down again that puts pugie in the
[00:49:19] lead and then that's yeah soft soft
[00:49:24] Jesus all right you speak two languages
[00:49:27] IE I prefer the original name that's so
[00:49:29] much easier purv P that's kind of like
[00:49:33] Russian to me
[00:49:35] wellong Mongolia is hugely surrounded
[00:49:39] partly by Russia and the other side
[00:49:41] would be China there so that makes a
[00:49:43] little sense just a little bit you know
[00:49:46] you know the the Mongols are so are so
[00:49:50] impressive throughout history and now
[00:49:52] they're coming back this is this is
[00:49:54] really cool I love the Mongolian team
[00:49:55] team by the way do you say Mongol or
[00:49:57] Mongolian Mongolian why do why people
[00:50:00] also say Mongol the Mongols when they
[00:50:03] talk about uh when I talk about the um
[00:50:07] the Mongol hordes that raided Europe and
[00:50:10] oh okay okay I don't know I don't
[00:50:14] Mongols are you sure it's is it
[00:50:16] Mongols it's Mongols so Mongolian is
[00:50:19] incorrect is mang no both but both both
[00:50:22] is right we we get two thumbs up yes
[00:50:25] from our Tech gu in background director
[00:50:28] who studied who studied the history of
[00:50:30] it Mongolia exactly all right we're all
[00:50:34] related to someone molia let us see I
[00:50:37] mean okay this is pretty much done here
[00:50:38] with um with Katie and pfia so let us
[00:50:41] switch to something more exciting maybe
[00:50:45] what's going on with Johan and
[00:50:48] Maro which would
[00:50:50] be table four table four none of our
[00:50:53] cameras are in the moment um pointed at
[00:50:56] them look at that beautiful thing up at
[00:50:59] the right corner extremem memory
[00:51:00] challenge.com right now we see Christian
[00:51:03] and johanes
[00:51:06] after um Johannes did the cards in 60
[00:51:10] seconds has 42 cards correct both of
[00:51:13] them are struggling there and there with
[00:51:14] the camera switching to Marlo and
[00:51:18] Johan there have 50 more seconds Johan
[00:51:22] is lead none of them has done a mistake
[00:51:24] yet and looks very much like Johan will
[00:51:27] be able to he has at least a good chance
[00:51:29] to put in the cards there in the last
[00:51:31] seconds Maro will struggle I mean that's
[00:51:33] only 46 now did a mistake Mal did a
[00:51:37] mistake now that looks Troublesome he
[00:51:39] has 30 more seconds and still7 48 for
[00:51:43] Johan is it going to get Perfection so
[00:51:46] oh yeah he Johan just put in the
[00:51:49] um card six and five there he has four
[00:51:53] more cards to put in he even if if you
[00:51:55] would guess he has a kind of a not not
[00:51:58] the worst chances no oh oh oh he just
[00:52:00] got 50 okay 5 seconds left two more cars
[00:52:04] 5 seconds I he will probably guess oh he
[00:52:07] just mixed it up ah too bad but
[00:52:10] nevertheless he wins the match he wins
[00:52:12] the match he wins the match what's the
[00:52:14] record for cards let's see uh
[00:52:16] 19.9 something by Alex just been done by

[00:52:50] exactly what they memorized and where
[00:52:53] they made the mistakes there's Nelson D
[00:52:55] the founder right there all happy and
[00:52:58] cheerful there is his
[00:53:01] fiance and they're marrying at my
[00:53:03] birthday the October 8th Prett cool at
[00:53:07] October Fest in Germany yeah I don't
[00:53:09] like that one I I always told myself on
[00:53:11] my on my gravestone there will be an
[00:53:14] inscription he was never at the October
[00:53:15] Fest why well because it's it's all
[00:53:18] about getting drunk with huge cups of of
[00:53:23] beer and what's wrong with they totally
[00:53:25] overpriced and I don't know I don't like
[00:53:27] it just it's a tradition it's a
[00:53:30] tradition but not every tradition it's a
[00:53:31] lovely tradition by you
[00:53:34] guys let's let's go back to the groups
[00:53:37] and see who was in the lead it's also
[00:53:39] it's also tradition for a German to go
[00:53:41] to mayorca and put and put their um and
[00:53:45] put and put their um um um um what what
[00:53:48] do you that towels they put their towels
[00:53:51] on a bench on a on a on a beach and that
[00:53:53] means the bench is reserved for them and
[00:53:55] for the rest of the day well that's what
[00:53:57] we do but that's really yes we do that
[00:54:00] have a pool at my people are disliking
[00:54:03] us for this Behavior I never I do that
[00:54:05] go up at like 4:00 a.m. okay you could
[00:54:07] be a good German I could be a good
[00:54:09] German right so back to the group so
[00:54:12] yeah we have the same groups again we
[00:54:14] have group E and group F again Pia
[00:54:17] versus K but the most points right now
[00:54:21] is johanes Zoo um Simon Reinhardt and
[00:54:26] right shart shart and so that so that
[00:54:30] was actually that was actually very
[00:54:31] interesting when we just saw that Yan
[00:54:33] won the game because that gave him the
[00:54:36] crucial three points that he needed to
[00:54:38] now come closer to Marlo who has 12
[00:54:40] points yeah when we look at that the
[00:54:42] last group here group F yeah um Yan has
[00:54:45] really good chances now to actually make
[00:54:49] it because Maro has 12 points
[00:54:51] and 12 points Johan even has the chances
[00:54:54] to
[00:54:56] play two in his group yep he only has
[00:54:58] one that's super
[00:55:00] exciting um let's see the stuff here oh
[00:55:02] no it's over here there we go what are
[00:55:05] you doing I'm trying to be like a
[00:55:06] meteorologist all right and here we see
[00:55:08] the CL so right here we see down here we
[00:55:11] see Johannes he is nine and
[00:55:14] one and he's got the best record pretty
[00:55:17] incredible stuff yeah it's always so so
[00:55:20] difficult to really um make up my mind
[00:55:23] um who I am for because of course all
[00:55:25] these guys are I know them I know them
[00:55:28] for for so long and they're all my
[00:55:31] friends and Associates somehow but I'm
[00:55:33] always for the underdog somehow so in
[00:55:35] this case I'm I'm really hoping that Yan
[00:55:38] will be able aage Joe
[00:55:41] aage Average Joe no no aage sh he's he's
[00:55:45] six and five he has 18 points he's only
[00:55:47] six away from the lead
[00:55:49] in years old but but he's but he in this
[00:55:52] case is not an underdog he already he's
[00:55:53] already at spot three
[00:55:55] um doesn't have a chance to come up to
[00:55:58] him anymore that's true he's only only
[00:56:01] third in his group but he it looks like
[00:56:03] as you can see from theor how's shuer
[00:56:05] done in the past he's pretty new he's a
[00:56:08] he's a newcomer to the to the Mongol
[00:56:11] team and um now when you say Mongol like
[00:56:14] are they coming together in like a yeah
[00:56:16] actually they are um in memory Sports
[00:56:19] pretty much next well next to the
[00:56:21] Chinese who are really coming as a team
[00:56:23] they have one coach they um actually
[00:56:26] that's an entire that's an entire story
[00:56:28] what's going on in Mongolia with a with
[00:56:31] a memory School of of of katna who's
[00:56:34] who's their coach uh he is being so
[00:56:37] successful that he's become one of the
[00:56:41] richest people in Mongolia within six
[00:56:43] years why don't you move there well I
[00:56:46] I'm having other plans my friend oh all
[00:56:49] right so um but he's really successful
[00:56:51] and he even made it possible that his um
[00:56:55] um calculating MH techniques that he
[00:56:59] didn't come up with but he adopted them
[00:57:00] from India and Japan and China that they
[00:57:03] have been uh put into the curriculum of
[00:57:07] um the Mongol education system so it's
[00:57:10] super successful and that's that's
[00:57:11] fantastic and that's actually exactly
[00:57:12] what we are striving for all around the
[00:57:14] world we want to bring memory techniques
[00:57:16] into school into Primary School you
[00:57:17] mentioned into University where it's of
[00:57:19] course also super helpful but if you
[00:57:21] learn this as a young child you will
[00:57:24] benefit from it much more than when you
[00:57:26] learn it 10 years later where you still
[00:57:28] will benefit from it of course but the
[00:57:30] younger the better because then the
[00:57:31] brain has much better much more time to
[00:57:35] adjust it and also people that are in
[00:57:37] their 60s and above it's great too to
[00:57:39] start them there Str your brain it's
[00:57:42] especially important because when you
[00:57:45] keep your brain active as a senior then
[00:57:49] you will be able to slow down NE
[00:57:52] neurodegenerative diseases like ala
[00:57:55] multiple sclerosis Parkinson so far you
[00:57:59] cannot really beat it if you have that
[00:58:01] was like a mandatory thing right after
[00:58:03] you
[00:58:04] retire you have to do a year of memory
[00:58:07] Sports would probably be good for the Ed
[00:58:10] for the health system but I'm I'm always
[00:58:12] a little bit skeptical when when people
[00:58:15] Force other people to do
[00:58:17] whatever yeah that's true but but you're
[00:58:20] right I
[00:58:21] mean there could be some really bad
[00:58:24] official programs that maybe not are
[00:58:27] mandatory but yeah sold very in a nice
[00:58:31] way look at
[00:58:34] this right FJ FJ so he just won a table
[00:58:39] one in 29.7 seconds beating Katie again
[00:58:43] two times in a row ktie no I think she's
[00:58:45] lost four times in a row since the break
[00:58:47] but I mean on the other hand she
[00:58:49] honestly maybe that's her strategy yeah
[00:58:52] I I doubt it I doubt it because when we
[00:58:53] look at what she is doing she's actually
[00:58:55] doing really really good on the other
[00:58:57] hand she memorized now the digits in 60
[00:58:59] seconds probably because she saw that
[00:59:01] there was the blue
[00:59:02] border um that which signifies that the
[00:59:06] opponent has just been stopped
[00:59:09] memorizing but let's go to table four
[00:59:11] cuz it's a very close match there 30
[00:59:14] seconds let us go to table four with
[00:59:15] Marlo against Yan this could be a UPS
[00:59:18] this is incredibly important for Johan
[00:59:20] to win but at the moment he's four
[00:59:22] digits behind Maro Marlo squeezed in
[00:59:26] several mistakes there maybe Yan will be
[00:59:28] able to isn't this Johan's specialty no
[00:59:31] his specialty are the cards
[00:59:34] so it doesn't really look good he only
[00:59:36] has 10 seconds left to find four more
[00:59:40] digits
[00:59:41] here kind of kind of looks like a loss
[00:59:45] now he's just typing something in oh he
[00:59:47] made a he hit the digit actually he hit
[00:59:50] the digit probably by guessing but it
[00:59:52] didn't wasn't good enough Marlo he lost
[00:59:55] that and that puts Marlo in a really
[00:59:56] good position Marlo is now going
[00:59:59] into um second position in group F no
[01:00:03] it's not true Chris no hadn't hadn't
[01:00:05] been updated yet and we had look will be
[01:00:08] going into second well we didn't look at
[01:00:10] Chris and Christian also also won so
[01:00:12] both of them got three more points which
[01:00:15] is incredibly painful for Johan because
[01:00:17] that puts him six points I feel bad for
[01:00:20] vess behind Marlo and Christian vessel's
[01:00:23] really struggling today he could have
[01:00:25] used that win vessel
[01:00:27] is pretty much out of the
[01:00:30] game they have he did 11 matches he's
[01:00:33] four more that makes four times three
[01:00:35] that's 12 points if we add that to his
[01:00:37] six he would be at 18 well still would
[01:00:41] be not too chabby it looks like Johnny
[01:00:43] with 18 with 18 he can make it but then
[01:00:46] he must really he must
[01:00:50] win well there are still he doesn't need
[01:00:53] to win every match match he could
[01:00:55] actually do 15 but then his accuracy
[01:00:57] wouldn't be good enough to beat the
[01:00:58] other guys with 15 points so he must win
[01:01:01] every single match to get 18 points he
[01:01:03] could do it he could he can do it could
[01:01:05] be a miracle we have seen we have seen
[01:01:07] these kinds of miracles last year before
[01:01:09] when when for example I mean where a
[01:01:12] different class of of athletes johanes
[01:01:15] Malo was so many I think he was like
[01:01:17] four matches behind in a was it the
[01:01:21] semifinals and
[01:01:23] he all of a sudden he one one one one
[01:01:26] one surpass one one one made it right so
[01:01:29] that was that was really
[01:01:32] crazy all
[01:01:34] right and we're back so yeah we are back
[01:01:36] on the screen ladies and gentlemen here
[01:01:38] we are faces uh my name is still written
[01:01:41] incorrectly with the um a gra the
[01:01:46] a oh they're pointing to it too my name
[01:01:49] is written correctly you can go to my
[01:01:51] Facebook page you can like me you can
[01:01:53] check me out I'm gonna post some
[01:01:55] incredible things on
[01:01:57] there I'm pretty talented so is this guy
[01:02:00] what are you talking about this this a
[01:02:02] very exciting tournament this is going
[01:02:04] to be a sport which is going to go on
[01:02:06] the rise it's going to keep going up

[01:02:13] absolutely good for your health and it's
[01:02:14] so fun it is so much fun it looks from
[01:02:16] the outside always like why should
[01:02:18] anyone do that sit down and memorize
[01:02:20] digits and you can go to Vegas and win
[01:02:22] I'm just kidding but so fun I mean
[01:02:25] let's let's let's have a quick look at
[01:02:27] at how this works actually I think we
[01:02:29] can um I prepared a couple of couple of
[01:02:33] images let me let me put them let me
[01:02:36] find them somewhere here on my hard
[01:02:38] drive and I will I will tell as soon as
[01:02:41] I found them we got we have vessel
[01:02:44] coming in vessel we were just talking
[01:02:48] about you let's let's skip my
[01:02:50] infographic here and let's invite you do
[01:02:53] we have another chair there there's not
[01:02:56] a single other man or woman will be
[01:02:59] right back it's actually quite funny you
[01:03:02] guys out there cannot see that but we
[01:03:03] are alone in a huge room right now right
[01:03:06] aren't we no we're not he's a liar hey
[01:03:08] everyone go to extreme memory
[01:03:09] challenge.com please go there click on
[01:03:13] the site take the test do the memory
[01:03:16] challenge see if you are an incredible
[01:03:18] human being but you can still be average
[01:03:19] and be amazing exactly when you are
[01:03:21] average then there are many great memory
[01:03:24] coaches out there who can help you with
[01:03:26] that like you for like me or some of the
[01:03:28] others who are here um at the I could
[01:03:30] coach you but incorrectly you want me in
[01:03:32] the middle yeah come in the Middle come
[01:03:33] in the middle so we can both cuddle with
[01:03:35] you there oh that's a really cool CH
[01:03:38] need some this is our one athlete from
[01:03:41] the Netherlands yes exactly look at this
[01:03:44] hair right here this is nice hair I like
[01:03:47] it he looks good so so vessel what's
[01:03:50] going on there we had no no no don't
[01:03:52] don't look at don't look at don't look
[01:03:53] at that's painful that's painful will we
[01:03:56] just calculated that you still have a
[01:03:58] chance Technically when you win all the
[01:03:59] other matches that have then you would
[01:04:02] you would have 18 points and with 18
[01:04:04] points you do have a realistic you I'll
[01:04:07] do it I'll do no seriously will you do
[01:04:08] it for us no no I can't why not have you
[01:04:11] given up or no but I mean there's no
[01:04:14] chance that I'll win all of my exp why
[01:04:16] not you should intimidate them actually
[01:04:19] if have did that with me right before
[01:04:21] images he he asked me like oh what's
[01:04:23] your person best and then I told him
[01:04:25] like oh I'm not going to tell you and
[01:04:27] then he told me he said like oh I got 14
[01:04:30] seconds which is ridiculously fast but
[01:04:32] because of that I like did it a little
[01:04:35] bit faster than I usually would do so
[01:04:37] you said people don't Trash Talk head
[01:04:40] it's a little thing that and and on that
[01:04:43] run I only switched the last two images
[01:04:46] oh by the way by the Way's let's look at
[01:04:48] this group your group vessel in your
[01:04:50] group P you have already made it to the
[01:04:52] finals where the seven points that he
[01:04:54] got there he is the second one now in
[01:04:57] the entire field of the xmt today after
[01:05:00] Lance who made it to the finals that
[01:05:02] puts you actually in an interesting
[01:05:04] position because what we have seen so
[01:05:06] far about the strategies of the
[01:05:08] competitors when they are qualified they
[01:05:10] will try to break records and that will
[01:05:12] of course put them in a position where
[01:05:14] they make mistakes right so you can you
[01:05:17] can you can probably benefit from that
[01:05:20] because I think I only have words
[01:05:21] against him left well it doesn't it
[01:05:23] doesn't matter exactly what you have
[01:05:25] against him because in all the remaining
[01:05:27] matches he might just go for as much as
[01:05:29] he can other thing is don't I would be
[01:05:32] in his shoes I would just go for as much
[01:05:34] as possible to try to get the
[01:05:36] $2,000 for for the daily best and he Al
[01:05:39] he knows he's not going to get like 50
[01:05:42] words in under 55 seconds so probably
[01:05:44] but uh on the other hand he might just
[01:05:46] play around who knows yeah might but
[01:05:48] also we don't know his age which is very
[01:05:50] worrisome do you know his age no I no
[01:05:53] idea but he's a junior isn't he I don't
[01:05:55] know I I I have no idea I I think I'm
[01:05:58] pretty sure he won at least at least up
[01:06:00] until now he won he was winning one
[01:06:03] junior Championship after after another
[01:06:05] so I'm not sure if he's already turned
[01:06:07] 18 or will turn 18 this year
[01:06:11] but I no what is your what is your age
[01:06:14] he's 21 I'm 21 that's not really much of
[01:06:17] a difference like in memory it's quite
[01:06:19] the difference actually because you can
[01:06:21] see that the the real young people like
[01:06:23] Yan hendrik on
[01:06:24] AA um everu they're doing so well and
[01:06:29] some of them without that much training
[01:06:31] and most of them with a totally
[01:06:32] different system which is everyone
[01:06:34] places just one immature Loki while
[01:06:37] older people always do two or even more
[01:06:40] right um and I I mean 15year olds do
[01:06:43] definitely have an edge over 20 they
[01:06:45] don't have much stress so you think so
[01:06:47] you think being younger even makes a
[01:06:50] difference in memory sport because so
[01:06:52] far we were discussing this and we were
[01:06:54] we had the opinion that they might they
[01:06:57] might have a little Advantage but you
[01:06:59] still even if you're older even if
[01:07:01] you're senior 60 years and older you
[01:07:04] might have a chance to beat the hell out
[01:07:06] of these young athletes don't you do you
[01:07:09] think that's incorrect I think that with
[01:07:11] the same training and the same
[01:07:13] strategies and such the young people
[01:07:15] would almost always win guys so we're in
[01:07:19] the images and look at Lance's time
[01:07:22] 13.47% Boris also has a record right now
[01:07:26] because if Lance doesn't get it Boris
[01:07:28] has it and if Boris and Lance don't get
[01:07:30] it clay has it yeah exactly I mean they
[01:07:33] they have they have all really
[01:07:35] incredible let's go to table four that's
[01:07:37] that's a huge one exactly let's let's
[01:07:39] let's switch to lens and Clay here
[01:07:41] because that's that's burning what's
[01:07:43] going on there both can win $2,000 right
[01:07:45] now so right now none of our cameras is
[01:07:48] directed at that table so one of the
[01:07:50] cameras has to switch over like the last
[01:07:53] like the errors lens and uh clay made at
[01:07:56] the last part those are going to be
[01:07:58] really tricky to take out because
[01:08:00] usually you don't memorize those you
[01:08:02] just like say like bird flower girl
[01:08:05] whatever and um and then in the time
[01:08:08] span between uh you click enter and uh
[01:08:12] you start recalling you might switch
[01:08:14] them around but look at that these I
[01:08:16] don't think he's going to I don't think
[01:08:18] he's going to switch them like if he's
[01:08:21] lucky he'll switch them Swit them all
[01:08:23] right camera Camera Action please yes
[01:08:25] there we go camera switching on Lance
[01:08:28] and Clay here now so here we say here we
[01:08:30] see Lance he sees come and she has 28 he
[01:08:34] didn't gets are you ever going to grow
[01:08:37] the beer too cuz you have the same hair
[01:08:39] I don't I don't think I can grow that B
[01:08:41] it's insane no but but but I don't agree
[01:08:43] he doesn't have the same he switched out
[01:08:46] he switched out one of his images yeah
[01:08:47] but it doesn't matter like it's it's
[01:08:49] wrong anyway it's wrong anyway exactly
[01:08:51] he still wins it was the wrong one that
[01:08:53] he but Boris got it Boris got it is that
[01:08:56] a new is that a new record 14 I think
[01:08:59] it's a record but it's look at the
[01:09:01] record 14 14 yeah but he gets $2,000
[01:09:05] which is it's at least the best from
[01:09:07] this year's XP so far so congratulations
[01:09:10] to Boris there we didn't now now we
[01:09:13] forced the cameraman to go to Lance and
[01:09:15] Clay but it was actually Boris taking
[01:09:16] the points but how would we know we're
[01:09:18] not oh that means that a lot more people
[01:09:21] have uh now we now we didn't now we
[01:09:23] didn't hear Boris look at him look at
[01:09:25] Boris he is so happy we didn't really
[01:09:29] hear his his Outburst I'm sure he may he
[01:09:31] prod he's always super loud he's always
[01:09:33] super loud I like having vessel here
[01:09:36] this if you're if you're on the opposite
[01:09:39] of Boris then and he wins you'll just
[01:09:42] like mentally destroy you he'll just rub
[01:09:44] it in be like
[01:09:46] yeah might this might also be some kind
[01:09:49] of strategy against his
[01:09:52] opponents I don't know just I think it's
[01:09:54] just a weird grunt he does yeah it's
[01:09:57] more than just a grunt though it's like
[01:10:00] a full on shout but it's so funny
[01:10:02] because he knows that he's being watched
[01:10:04] because people like that about him but
[01:10:06] it doesn't it's not like he's doing that
[01:10:08] on purpose because you can't really do
[01:10:10] that on purpose and and look and look
[01:10:13] sincere I mean I do it too if if I just
[01:10:16] won $2,000 yeah but I mean like right
[01:10:18] now I'm way behind so I'm not going to
[01:10:21] shout if I win you never know vessel you
[01:10:23] never
[01:10:24] why not honestly when you win when you
[01:10:26] win the next match that that I don't
[01:10:29] know the next match you have that would
[01:10:31] put you back on on track to get actually
[01:10:34] to um it wouldn't well with the way the
[01:10:37] way you talk right now everyone everyone
[01:10:39] keep saying this everyone who I talk to
[01:10:41] about the memory thing they say like oh
[01:10:43] you got to keep a positive attitude but
[01:10:45] I know that there's a certain point
[01:10:46] where I can't really qualify anymore
[01:10:49] like yeah technically it's possible but
[01:10:51] it's the same with so what are you going
[01:10:52] to do after I'm just going to try and
[01:10:55] I'm going to try and break some personal
[01:10:57] bests and then I honestly I think I
[01:11:01] believe in a universe when when you
[01:11:03] force when you are concentrating enough
[01:11:06] on on your goals everything is going to
[01:11:07] happen even if it's like the unrealistic
[01:11:10] outcome in the world and it's not the
[01:11:12] most unrealistic outcome here so yeah
[01:11:14] because other people would specifically
[01:11:16] have to lose for me to to go through the
[01:11:18] next
[01:11:19] round like if Marlo andan hendrik win
[01:11:23] even one game then I can't go to the
[01:11:26] next round so it's going to no no I'm
[01:11:29] not going to go through the next round
[01:11:30] you're kind of it's
[01:11:33] fine no because like if if I still
[01:11:35] believe that I'm going to go through the
[01:11:36] next round then it's even more
[01:11:38] disappointing if I don't so you want to
[01:11:39] stay with us here then instead I mean at
[01:11:42] least you're cool guy to at least you
[01:11:44] don't have the worst record be up our I
[01:11:45] don't have the worst record which is a
[01:11:47] huge relief yeah and I also didn't lose
[01:11:50] all of my matches which is also huge
[01:11:52] relief but I would really like to go go
[01:11:53] for like four we have four wins or
[01:11:56] something we have two more we have two
[01:11:57] more qualif qual and you have a better
[01:11:59] recall how do you say qualif
[01:12:02] qualif no I'm the worst no she oh she
[01:12:05] here has even worse what's what's the
[01:12:07] noun for a person who
[01:12:10] qualified the a noun the the qualify the
[01:12:14] like like the S qualifier the
[01:12:18] qualifier all right anyhow we have
[01:12:20] Johannes we have Johannes being
[01:12:22] qualified for the finals tomorrow and we
[01:12:26] have he sweaty right now or what oh yes
[01:12:29] look look at Alex he looks wow he looks
[01:12:32] stressed out he's shining although he's
[01:12:35] doing a good job he's on position number
[01:12:36] one even though Everett has only been 15
[01:12:38] for a single day like look look look how
[01:12:41] happy he is he is tough yeah Everett
[01:12:44] really looks like he wants to dive into
[01:12:46] his computer out of out of fun everyone
[01:12:48] does that you can see Alex as well
[01:12:50] everyone just tries to get as close as
[01:12:52] possible to get as little outside
[01:12:54] station is two card method by both of
[01:12:56] them yeah which is such an insane method
[01:12:59] do you know how much time it takes to
[01:13:01] get like familiar with the two card
[01:13:03] system it takes it takes
[01:13:07] 16.86 seconds for Alex this is the
[01:13:10] fastest time in the history of memory
[01:13:12] sport that I've ever seen in my entire
[01:13:14] life this is less I haven't even seen a
[01:13:16] training dreams come true we were we
[01:13:19] were
[01:13:21] just but he better get I'm I don't have
[01:13:24] words anymore he better get it right
[01:13:26] though he doesn't look though he he
[01:13:27] looks like he's completely looks like
[01:13:29] he's drenched and he's just you know
[01:13:31] pass out he he looks like he's losing a
[01:13:33] pound during just this five minutes of
[01:13:36] of this event that' be of just sweating
[01:13:39] it out I mean not not for him yeah not
[01:13:41] for him but like for all for lots of
[01:13:44] people ever's taking his time right now
[01:13:45] not for me not for you the two of us
[01:13:48] doesn't mustn't happen to us right
[01:13:50] exactly we are too skinny for that so
[01:13:52] yeah took it ever took it safe he was
[01:13:55] really fast though he he was slightly
[01:13:58] behind him yeah but I think he knew that
[01:13:59] he wouldn't get I think he wanted to do
[01:14:02] the recall of the riew yeah his record
[01:14:05] he beat it by 3 seconds yeah I really
[01:14:08] hope that ever goes through to the next
[01:14:11] round I too he's he's doing a lot better
[01:14:13] than when he started out the beginning
[01:14:14] like he's he's so young and I mean it'd
[01:14:16] be so cool for him if he wins or at
[01:14:18] least like goes the guy that just turned
[01:14:20] 15 yesterday no right he's he certainly
[01:14:23] he certainly is a candidate of the heart
[01:14:25] here for this entire Championship the
[01:14:27] youngest athlete he just had his
[01:14:28] birthday yesterday he was so desperately
[01:14:31] hoping that he can win one match against
[01:14:33] Alex and now he's doing so good even
[01:14:36] with the the words against Alex I mean I
[01:14:39] have not been excited as excited for my
[01:14:41] own games as for the results of his work
[01:14:44] right Honest honestly I think I think
[01:14:46] Everett is um from from all 24 uh
[01:14:50] competitors that we have here at the xmt
[01:14:53] the the most surprising the most
[01:14:56] surprising outcome on what he does
[01:14:59] people were expecting a lot somehow
[01:15:02] because like a he was still SE 21 like
[01:15:06] he was doing good enough to compete but
[01:15:08] I mean Alex might break let's let's
[01:15:11] concentrate Alex is doing good 2 minutes
[01:15:13] and 40 seconds left look at that I mean
[01:15:15] honestly I want to go in the other room
[01:15:17] right now and Sh and dance or something
[01:15:21] H I want to I want I want to leave this
[01:15:24] room or I I I I you should just go I
[01:15:27] want to go in the other room but you but
[01:15:29] I must see that first I'll take over
[01:15:31] when he when he puts in when he puts in
[01:15:33] these remaining four cards now and they
[01:15:34] are green when he puts in these two
[01:15:36] remaining two cards and they are green I
[01:15:38] will leave this seriously break here go
[01:15:42] it by guys by guys I'm going in the
[01:15:44] other room wow he just offal record with
[01:15:47] like his own record with yeah but that's
[01:15:50] uh I don't think that that will be
[01:15:51] recognized as the official record this
[01:15:53] one 19.7 but the official record is
[01:15:55] still like 20 something so technically
[01:15:58] he breaks the world record with four
[01:15:59] seconds today 23. 34 in 2015 and now he
[01:16:04] just crushed it oh my God crushed it but
[01:16:06] this is such a ridiculous score I think
[01:16:09] he sold his sold of the I mean every is
[01:16:11] taking off his headphones he's like
[01:16:12] never mind I know I can't win this yeah
[01:16:15] but look at her he's still finished yeah
[01:16:17] he did I mean that's still an amazing
[01:16:19] score a deck of cards in 52 uh in 6
[01:16:23] that's insane and now Alex is going to
[01:16:25] like sweat it out even more so we we're
[01:16:29] correcting this Mongols are a tribe who
[01:16:31] could come from a variety of countries
[01:16:34] uh Mongolian describes a
[01:16:37] country thank you I'm actually going to
[01:16:40] take over I'm just going to here you can
[01:16:42] eat his cookie too no I won't do that to
[01:16:44] him so there's a minute left in the
[01:16:47] recall yeah but he ain't going to change
[01:16:49] it looks like Simon won a table one
[01:16:51] against Johnny Johnny only has one win
[01:16:54] sjay just beat marwin because of his
[01:16:57] seconds he did in 32 seconds Alex just
[01:17:01] beat his own record and created a world
[01:17:03] record oh and Yen's oh yena's losing
[01:17:07] hard
[01:17:08] yeah so we're still on table four right
[01:17:11] now let's go to table
[01:17:14] four no she won't get it but for Alex he
[01:17:18] will definitely I think he won't change
[01:17:20] anything but if because if you get it
[01:17:22] like in 3 minutes it feels right you
[01:17:24] know like works yeah of course he's so
[01:17:28] nervous this is something he's been
[01:17:30] working on for years like for hours and
[01:17:33] hours and hours how how long do you uh
[01:17:36] train a
[01:17:37] day right before competition like in the
[01:17:40] last month at least an hour a day I try
[01:17:43] like on average about an hour so that
[01:17:45] like to a fan out there it's actually
[01:17:47] sounds like we could do this yeah you
[01:17:49] could definitely do it it's and it's
[01:17:51] it's just training oh wait Alex is is
[01:17:53] going to probably freak out as he should
[01:17:56] as he
[01:17:59] should wow the world record and he
[01:18:02] crushed it 16.82 seconds look at ever
[01:18:06] he's happy for him too yeah ever mostly
[01:18:09] just disappointed that he didn't get
[01:18:10] another points on look
[01:18:12] floran he's so happy he's like I need to
[01:18:15] take a picture with you come on for my
[01:18:18] website wow that's everyone that's
[01:18:20] incredible it will take a while before
[01:18:24] someone else breaks This Record like
[01:18:26] there's a big chance that Alex himself
[01:18:29] will break this within the like yeah
[01:18:31] within the reasonable future but or
[01:18:35] days I he might actually actually he
[01:18:38] might break it in the next couple days
[01:18:40] but someone else it will take a while
[01:18:41] look at him look at him
[01:18:44] incredible would you be happy just
[01:18:46] winning this and then let's say you
[01:18:47] don't do anything else the rest of that
[01:18:48] dude I would go 14 and one with like
[01:18:52] yeah horrible scores like horrible
[01:18:54] scores if I get one of those
[01:18:57] scores because then I just go home and
[01:18:59] be like yep world record did
[01:19:01] it now does that go in the Guinness
[01:19:03] World
[01:19:04] Record should I don't think what is that
[01:19:07] right there on the right corner let's
[01:19:10] say where should we go to oh extrem
[01:19:12] memory challenge.com yes we should test
[01:19:15] your brain go do the
[01:19:17] challenge and in a year you can be just
[01:19:20] as excited as Alex Mullen to a deck of
[01:19:23] cards in 16
[01:19:25] seconds there we go let's take our time
[01:19:28] to applaud
[01:19:30] him oh man that's an insane SC look look
[01:19:33] at Nelson he's getting it right now I
[01:19:35] mean like top people people who are good
[01:19:37] get within the minutes like if you do
[01:19:39] under 40 seconds you're really good like
[01:19:42] everyone's like okay you're going to do
[01:19:43] under 40 seconds and he takes like even
[01:19:46] less than half that time that I can't
[01:19:49] believe that if you take the top 10 it's
[01:19:51] probably I know right he just
[01:19:53] he just presses as fast as possible what
[01:19:55] how does he do it is it so it's you use
[01:19:58] the numbers and the letters I don't know
[01:20:00] how to he does I think he uses like yeah
[01:20:03] he uses a two card system so every two
[01:20:06] cards from one image so they're like um
[01:20:11] a total of
[01:20:13] 2,714 Imes something and look you're
[01:20:16] back on this is vessel it's not
[01:20:19] Florian Florian left he wanted to be
[01:20:21] where the party is and and we're just
[01:20:23] gonna stick with vessel the rest of the
[01:20:25] day I think I should call matches though
[01:20:28] you should when's your next match uh I
[01:20:31] have no oh it might be in like I don't
[01:20:34] know are they going to do another match
[01:20:35] otherwise it's right
[01:20:37] now you know what I think I should go
[01:20:40] back uh beat the crap out of beat the
[01:20:43] crap out of everyone let's do this out
[01:20:45] all of the other people and then still
[01:20:47] go to the top 16 sir all right we go
[01:20:52] I'll send FL
[01:20:54] no no I like
[01:20:55] this I'm the king of my
[01:20:58] domain so right now I'm going to go
[01:21:00] through the groups and check the
[01:21:02] rankings so in group a Johannes is
[01:21:05] clearly in the lead he has a 9 and3
[01:21:08] record 27 points as recalls
[01:21:12] 92.7 she uh cc is in second place and
[01:21:16] then in group C Simons in first place 10
[01:21:19] and two with 30 points he's tied with
[01:21:22] the most points with Lance and Lance is
[01:21:24] in group b at 10 and two and Boris is he
[01:21:27] could still take the lead you never know
[01:21:29] he has 24 points he's eight he's eight
[01:21:30] and four there's still three events left
[01:21:33] Group D we have Alex M Mullen who just
[01:21:35] broke his own record and just created
[01:21:37] another world record and janja is six
[01:21:41] points behind him but Alex mullen's
[01:21:44] recall is
[01:21:46] 9.58 and in group E we have fuj who's
[01:21:50] nine and2 with 27 points and look at
[01:21:53] that recall
[01:22:02] 94.67% points recalls at
[01:22:05] 93.5 4 but I just want to talk about
[01:22:09] everu again just incredible guy he
[01:22:11] started out 0 and3 now he's six- six
[01:22:14] he's only nine points behind so if he go
[01:22:17] wi The Next Three Tournament next three
[01:22:19] events he can get in the lead oh here is
[01:22:22] world record Champion he's a world
[01:22:25] memory champion and he just created a
[01:22:27] world memory record he becomes the world
[01:22:29] memory Champion exactly with something
[01:22:32] that I just talk told him that will not
[01:22:35] be broken for a while I guess I mean we
[01:22:37] never know but this really is
[01:22:40] outrageously fast he just had a
[01:22:44] 2.44 world record in speed cards a few
[01:22:48] months ago and then you you started to
[01:22:50] break that at the qualification for the
[01:22:52] first first time which wasn't really
[01:22:53] anything official and then you go to
[01:22:55] went to the USA memory championship and
[01:22:57] you broke it with what was that 18.6
[01:23:00] 1865 65 yeah right and and now this what
[01:23:04] is that what let's have a look at this
[01:23:06] one more time here how do you do it so
[01:23:08] quickly wow what the heck practice
[01:23:12] honestly my heart is pumping right now I
[01:23:14] think he's more excited than you are I I
[01:23:16] mean honestly most of that recall time I
[01:23:18] was really worried about these two cards
[01:23:20] yeah I saw that at the end you were
[01:23:22] going back
[01:23:23] five of Hearts three of clubs
[01:23:25] because this is probably not going to
[01:23:27] make sense but I so that image for me is
[01:23:30] uh is Liz Lemon from 30 Rock y you know
[01:23:34] and in my head I usually read like the
[01:23:36] last three or four just like quickly
[01:23:37] just read them to myself without even
[01:23:39] picturing it right and I read I read
[01:23:41] lemon because it's it's it doesn't the
[01:23:44] way I encode it isn't quite like Liz
[01:23:46] Lemon so I read it sort of as lemon
[01:23:47] right
[01:23:49] and but but then I thought I might have
[01:23:52] accidentally misread it or no okay back
[01:23:55] up for a second so I thought when I said
[01:23:57] it to myself I said lemon I thought that
[01:23:59] it was an actual lemon which is another
[01:24:01] one of my images um and then so I
[01:24:03] thought I might have misread like my
[01:24:06] actual lemon as what would oh you got
[01:24:09] another lemon there as well I've got
[01:24:11] I've got Liz Lemon and I've got a lemon
[01:24:13] and they have different pairs and I and
[01:24:15] I and I read lemon and I thought it was
[01:24:16] the lemon and I thought I might have
[01:24:18] misread it because this if it was the
[01:24:21] reverse I'm getting way tracker was the
[01:24:23] reverse um for me it's like this stage
[01:24:26] Spotlight right and I thought there was
[01:24:28] a chance I might have accident maybe it
[01:24:29] was the stage Spotlight and I
[01:24:30] accidentally misread it as lemon instead
[01:24:33] of limel which is actually how I encode
[01:24:35] it um so but I but I I stuck with lemon
[01:24:40] got lucky you trusted your instinct or
[01:24:42] your rational analyzing I just I cuz I
[01:24:46] knew that there was a there was a chance
[01:24:48] that I just misread it but but I also
[01:24:51] know that there was a there's a decent
[01:24:53] chance that if I read Liz Lemon I might
[01:24:56] have just read the lemon part for some
[01:24:57] reason instead of instead of like L
[01:25:00] lemon actually how I encod it how close
[01:25:02] were you to switching it I'd say it was
[01:25:05] like I was about like 75% sure this was
[01:25:09] right that's but not yeah yeah yeah well
[01:25:13] this is we were like don't change it
[01:25:15] don't change this is incredible I mean
[01:25:18] but but so I I mean the entire recall I
[01:25:20] wasn't I wasn't really thinking to
[01:25:21] myself like yes I've I got it I was so
[01:25:24] worried that I made look at that look at
[01:25:25] that right
[01:25:26] now Alex Mullen new world record speed
[01:25:29] cut this this is
[01:25:34] completely this is really cool I mean
[01:25:35] when I started with memory techniques
[01:25:37] world record was I think I I saw Ben
[01:25:40] pritmore breaking it with 33 seconds
[01:25:43] something and before that it was even
[01:25:45] slower than that 35 seconds that is half
[01:25:48] of it that is half of it and by then it
[01:25:50] was completely that was completely crazy
[01:25:53] and then seeing how it goes down how it
[01:25:56] goes for the first time under 302nd how
[01:25:57] it goes for the first time with with
[01:25:59] Simon's world record under under 25
[01:26:01] second was 24.9 something I think the
[01:26:04] the video is still online he did that in
[01:26:07] 2009 at the South German memory
[01:26:08] championship and then later he broke
[01:26:10] that little bit and then finally he went
[01:26:14] down to
[01:26:15] 21 something 21 it was 21.1 N I think or
[01:26:19] something like that for a while right
[01:26:21] and then like that was that was the mark
[01:26:22] sort of I was I was chasing for a long
[01:26:24] time all right 24 was Ben it wasn't
[01:26:26] Simon Ben was 24 he was the first one
[01:26:30] under and Simon was 21 actually 21
[01:26:33] something then he broke that slightly
[01:26:35] yep I think he did 20 he did 23 and then
[01:26:37] he did or maybe that was after he
[01:26:39] already broke in the 21 but he did
[01:26:42] 21.9 and then he did 21.1 n right and I
[01:26:46] think and then he obviously went to 2044
[01:26:49] after 244 exactly and now you were like
[01:26:51] throwing that in his face over and over
[01:26:53] and over again within the shortest time
[01:26:56] I mean that's still that's still the the
[01:26:58] the WMC record did did your wife uh
[01:27:01] message you or did your wife M your wife
[01:27:03] I didn't I Haven I came right here I
[01:27:05] looked yeah yeah I didn't give him any
[01:27:07] chance I just I just pulled at him
[01:27:08] basically come on come on we need to go
[01:27:10] to the Liv I saw you run over all right
[01:27:12] before you leave us again to get some
[01:27:14] some some some rest and and breath go to
[01:27:17] the next event just I mean honestly
[01:27:19] everyone in the world is already asking
[01:27:21] you about your card syst before that but
[01:27:24] now since you did this
[01:27:26] incredibly thing there I don't even know
[01:27:28] how I con I must call this we need to
[01:27:30] find a good name for that the Mullen or
[01:27:34] something the Mullen um do you think
[01:27:37] it's the system or it's you or both um I
[01:27:41] think it's mostly the system I I think I
[01:27:43] mean I I think it's partly me in the
[01:27:46] sense that I cards is my favorite event
[01:27:47] so I sort of train that you know to the
[01:27:50] detriment of a lot of my other events
[01:27:52] um but I definitely I mean you know I
[01:27:54] used to use a Pao system a one card Pao
[01:27:56] and I you're in first place and I was
[01:27:58] basically like you know hitting around
[01:28:01] like 40 or I sort of plateaued around
[01:28:03] like upper 30s and yeah I mean
[01:28:06] definitely once I once I change systems
[01:28:08] it just everything was different you
[01:28:10] know what I mean like I I I I doubt that
[01:28:11] I would be able to do this time using
[01:28:13] the same system when you when you when
[01:28:15] you compare this what you do there with
[01:28:17] this mixture of Johan Malo and Lance
[01:28:20] chard's approach yeah when you compare
[01:28:22] this to johanes Malo or Lance chart or
[01:28:25] Ben pritmore who all have these double
[01:28:27] card systems but with different Co
[01:28:29] codifications do you think it's Superior
[01:28:32] or it's just how you handle that
[01:28:34] particular approach um what do you think
[01:28:36] I don't know I you know I I do think my
[01:28:38] system sort of works for me pretty well
[01:28:41] uh I mean I I like it because it is
[01:28:43] fewer images you know the like the large
[01:28:46] two card systems like B just say half
[01:28:48] off the images right so I mean initially
[01:28:50] so there's sort of like a drawback back
[01:28:52] a negative um of doing that which is
[01:28:54] that you have to do this variable number
[01:28:56] of images per location so you don't know
[01:28:58] how many Loy your deck is going to take
[01:29:00] um Katie just won her event at table 2
[01:29:03] for words oh my gosh what did she do
[01:29:05] broke it again she BR she broke her own
[01:29:07] record so we got to get her in here
[01:29:10] now kind we kind of have so much going
[01:29:13] on congratulations that that's history
[01:29:17] today honestly thank you all right and
[01:29:19] and I'll I'll find Katie and send her in
[01:29:21] here all right man this is wow so Katie
[01:29:24] just beat Melanie I I can I can actually
[01:29:27] I can go home now I have seen everything
[01:29:29] now and that's just like it's it's all
[01:29:33] over memories that was nice that was a
[01:29:35] nice X it was wor missing this event
[01:29:37] because that was just the most amazing
[01:29:39] thing I've ever
[01:29:40] seen yeah in memory Sports yeah yeah
[01:29:43] yeah it was incredible and so PJ FJ just
[01:29:46] won he had 42 and 60 seconds Katie just
[01:29:50] set another record johannas beat Johan
[01:29:53] 41 in 59 seconds and a table four
[01:29:57] Christian just beat Marlo Knight wow 38
[01:30:00] to 36 60 seconds we missed we missed a
[01:30:02] couple of really cool matches here I'm
[01:30:04] sorry for that but that was history
[01:30:06] think everyone out there are really
[01:30:07] appreciate that we had a quick talk with
[01:30:09] Alex here and the speed cards are the
[01:30:13] most famous and most popular discipline
[01:30:17] of all memory Sports
[01:30:20] so you can breathe I can breathe now
[01:30:23] yeah you had you should have seen him he
[01:30:26] was he was shaking yeah I know his hands
[01:30:29] were shaking histi body it was this was
[01:30:32] exhausting as he was running the 100 met
[01:30:34] in 5 seconds or something let's see so
[01:30:39] and there there is the old previous
[01:30:41] speed cards record holder Ben prito
[01:30:43] sitting down at the table to to to go
[01:30:45] against thean HRI busher Again by the
[01:30:48] way Simon I just I mean I was just stand
[01:30:50] standing next to Simon in the room and
[01:30:52] Simon used to have going out of my
[01:30:54] mind are there's Nelson again with us
[01:30:57] everyone 16 seconds what and the just
[01:31:01] one more second she's like no that
[01:31:03] wasn't good enough what I had before
[01:31:05] yeah let's talk about this we completely
[01:31:06] missed that because we were with Alexi
[01:31:08] and talking with him we didn't see
[01:31:09] anything of that so just tell us a
[01:31:11] little bit what was going on with Katie
[01:31:13] right now no she just said another world
[01:31:15] record so she had the best score earlier
[01:31:17] I believe it was 55 and change seconds
[01:31:20] No 53 well before well it was 55 and now
[01:31:23] she's she did 53 and they both beat
[01:31:26] their own records today yeah so so Alex
[01:31:29] had a 19 second deck I believe before
[01:31:32] right and now 16 which is as I was
[01:31:34] saying the fastest any person has
[01:31:37] recorded a has memorized a deck of cards
[01:31:40] at a competition right exactly now for
[01:31:43] you I know you can't compare one to the
[01:31:44] other but what do you think's harder
[01:31:46] words or number I mean or cards I think
[01:31:49] words is harder honest honestly because
[01:31:52] you have uh we have Katie here I'll let
[01:31:54] her see here she can explain herself
[01:31:56] actually do you want to come talk a bit
[01:31:58] Yeah W this is exciting ladies and
[01:32:01] gentlemen we have one world record after
[01:32:02] another we have people breaking their
[01:32:04] own world records here live at xmt Katie
[01:32:09] look at look at this there was just look
[01:32:11] at that look at this Bea these beautiful
[01:32:13] words you had a dragonfly there in there
[01:32:15] that's fantastic you had a you had a
[01:32:17] tsunami going on they had a paradise
[01:32:19] yeah basically nearly finished with a
[01:32:21] paradise
[01:32:22] pretty did you know right then and there
[01:32:24] you're like I beat my record no because
[01:32:26] there was one word hesitate that I was I
[01:32:29] was hesitating I wasn't sure about that
[01:32:31] one so we we were just we were just
[01:32:34] saying that you had to show Alex this
[01:32:36] this this honestly yeah I mean Alex just
[01:32:39] did break yeah but I mean this
[01:32:42] was how how can I put this in word what
[01:32:44] you did here although sweet card is the
[01:32:47] most popular one everyone loves that but
[01:32:50] this one is so much more difficult what
[01:32:51] you just did here all the 5050 words all
[01:32:54] perfect you memorize all of and you did
[01:32:55] that in 53.65 seconds what's going on
[01:32:59] there that's so high 53.5 no it's really
[01:33:02] cool honestly congratulations and you
[01:33:05] really you really show everyone out
[01:33:08] there that
[01:33:09] how how it's being done you you really
[01:33:12] you really put yourself into the into
[01:33:16] the uh I don't I don't know how you say
[01:33:18] that there these these analogies now
[01:33:21] these these Milestones of memory
[01:33:23] athletes um and you still have a chance
[01:33:25] to beat
[01:33:26] FJ oh you still have a chance to uh
[01:33:30] first place right right and you qualif
[01:33:32] and you and you both qualified in that
[01:33:34] round for the finals didn't you right so
[01:33:36] you were now you have three more events
[01:33:38] you can do
[01:33:39] it yeah um I'm just still in sh yeah we
[01:33:44] all are I mean I just you know when I
[01:33:47] saw the time I thought wow this is a
[01:33:49] chance but when Simon beat my record I
[01:33:51] was
[01:33:52] I was a little dearit and I just thought
[01:33:54] I don't want to put pressure on myself
[01:33:55] if it happens it happens but I'm going
[01:33:56] to try and qualify and when I saw it all
[01:33:59] go green burst into tear it was um yeah
[01:34:03] I was very happy so I think Simon has no
[01:34:06] more words um rounds to come so you did
[01:34:09] it we for year we'll see what other
[01:34:12] people have more days you're really
[01:34:13] holding up the canle here all the female
[01:34:15] athletes that's I mean honestly what do
[01:34:17] you what do you say to all the girls out
[01:34:18] there who who who look at this now and
[01:34:20] think that I actually might have a that
[01:34:22] hey I think every female in this
[01:34:23] competition is doing very well yes
[01:34:27] exactly I think it's brilliant because
[01:34:29] we have this sport where we can actually
[01:34:32] do it together we don't have to separate
[01:34:34] ourself stupidly like in the physical
[01:34:36] Sports because of differences in yeah no
[01:34:38] I don't like that it's always the like
[01:34:40] having
[01:34:42] this dividing factor in in sports you
[01:34:45] know have female football and you have
[01:34:47] female athletes running and I understand
[01:34:50] that we just disc this right it's a
[01:34:52] physic it's a physical disadvantage very
[01:34:54] often but here that's not the case quite
[01:34:56] the contrary you you really show that um
[01:35:00] a uh because the the female brain weighs
[01:35:04] less I think than the than the male
[01:35:06] brain and very long time males always
[01:35:08] said yeah yeah that's that means we are
[01:35:10] smarter we are greater we are better and
[01:35:11] that's absolutely not true that has
[01:35:13] nothing to do with intelligence or what
[01:35:14] you can do with that and especially with
[01:35:19] the words which are so difficult
[01:35:22] uh it's fantastic it's really good so
[01:35:25] did youon used my technique with the
[01:35:28] initial letter I don't know if you saw
[01:35:29] that but um I was writing the initial
[01:35:32] letter of each um each word on the
[01:35:35] recall what been doing just doing that
[01:35:38] for the time he started doing it I think
[01:35:39] so yeah it was was brilliant and it
[01:35:42] worked it worked so you're already
[01:35:43] creating new Styles and systems with
[01:35:46] what you do here today that's what I was
[01:35:47] telling you at the beginning I was like
[01:35:48] is it good to remember the first letter
[01:35:51] in the the name yeah all right although
[01:35:53] and then you put it down although I
[01:35:54] still think what what you hinted
[01:35:56] at you memorized just the first letter
[01:35:59] and then you kind of guess from the
[01:36:01] first letter
[01:36:02] L yeah it's great that you know memory
[01:36:05] Sports is still so young that we're
[01:36:06] still creating systems and working out
[01:36:08] what's the best way to do things and
[01:36:10] we're all coming up with ideas we like
[01:36:11] sharing our ideas and it's yeah that's
[01:36:13] what's really great now look at this
[01:36:15] radio Table Three Lance sitting Indian
[01:36:17] style again that's a style oh yeah both
[01:36:19] these guys have a style one scre other
[01:36:21] one that's Indian style watching these
[01:36:24] two this is they're incredible yeah and
[01:36:27] both of them have already been qualified
[01:36:29] for the final day so they
[01:36:32] just give everything there still want to
[01:36:34] do their best right let's see so
[01:36:38] Boris he's eight and four and Lance is
[01:36:41] 10- two the recall is very very similar
[01:36:44] Boris actually has a better recall than
[01:36:47] Lance wow right well it's getting silent
[01:36:51] I really feel like everything is set for
[01:36:53] the rest of the day well just relax that
[01:36:55] was so that was so crazy already with
[01:36:57] with with Alex and right where the next
[01:36:59] big thing comes in so you're going to
[01:37:01] stick with that method yeah definitely I
[01:37:03] like
[01:37:04] it I think I'm going to apply some of
[01:37:07] these things I do in words to other
[01:37:08] events now like the fixed person in the
[01:37:10] location I'm going to do that in cards
[01:37:12] and numbers so it's incredible are you
[01:37:14] using are you using your memory
[01:37:16] techniques for learning somehow learning
[01:37:19] learning anything that you want to keep
[01:37:22] for the rest of your life I would like
[01:37:23] to but I time is so limited that you
[01:37:26] know it's only about training um right I
[01:37:29] don't have time to I love to learn more
[01:37:31] languages and things like that and use
[01:37:32] my memory techniques for all sorts of
[01:37:34] things but because it always it feels
[01:37:36] always like when when we see when we see
[01:37:38] you doing these kind of things like you
[01:37:40] must be able to to memorize like a
[01:37:42] thousand words in any kind of language
[01:37:44] in in half a day and you'll probably
[01:37:47] remember more than 90% of them actually
[01:37:49] I think everyone can do that with with a
[01:37:51] bit of dedication it's not really like a
[01:37:53] magic trick but you would really fly
[01:37:56] over that and you would you would go to
[01:37:58] breakfast where the other ones are at at
[01:38:01] word number 10 or something I love
[01:38:03] learning languages so yeah I want to do
[01:38:05] a lot more of that
[01:38:07] yeah we'll let you
[01:38:09] relax thank you thank you thank you
[01:38:12] congratulations very
[01:38:14] inspiring wow and there comes Nelson
[01:38:18] again jump back in thank you because I'm
[01:38:20] really out of what now we watching all
[01:38:23] that stuff it makes me wish that I I
[01:38:24] could compete in this thing and I don't
[01:38:27] back I I'll I'll find a way to come back
[01:38:30] words and names are like my favorite
[01:38:32] thing but I don't know if I could do
[01:38:35] that you could be the MJ own the team
[01:38:37] and come back and play for it did he do
[01:38:40] that I think he but the Wizards he
[01:38:41] didn't know the Wizards did he yeah what
[01:38:43] are you talking about Michael Jordan
[01:38:45] Michael Jordan oh okay wait no sorry
[01:38:47] he's part owner okay and then yeah he
[01:38:50] owns the or he own the Bobcats right yep
[01:38:52] Charlotte yep which doesn't exist
[01:38:55] Charlotte Hornets
[01:38:56] now anyways this is not physical Sports
[01:39:00] here it's mental Sports still exhausting
[01:39:03] and I always think that that everyone
[01:39:07] who got good at the sport and then
[01:39:10] stagnated or dropped out of the sport
[01:39:12] they always had the chance to come back
[01:39:14] and really get to the top again so
[01:39:16] someone like like Ben pritma for example
[01:39:18] he's now he's not really doing great
[01:39:20] here today he's a bit disint he's he's
[01:39:22] at the bottom of his group um but he's
[01:39:26] still a world class memorizer and if you
[01:39:28] really he could come back it's just a
[01:39:31] matter
[01:39:32] of to sit down and train yeah exactly
[01:39:35] but you know it's it's tough and then
[01:39:37] you'll it's the constant cycle I mean
[01:39:39] you'll see Alex go through this and
[01:39:41] Lance at some point in their life is
[01:39:44] where do you find the motivation when
[01:39:45] you're you've been at the top for so
[01:39:47] long um
[01:39:49] money maybe You' be surprised even when
[01:39:52] there is money I mean money now why
[01:39:55] don't I try I know that if I worked hard
[01:39:58] I could be up there still right why am I
[01:40:00] not doing it that's exhausting right
[01:40:02] don't you need to take a year off two
[01:40:04] years I don't know but it's that's the
[01:40:06] thing even yonas is Jonas going to come
[01:40:08] back he said so he said he's
[01:40:11] taking year off like like you but do you
[01:40:13] think he'll uh you know it's it's it's
[01:40:16] one of these things in sports I think
[01:40:17] it's hard to like when you reach your
[01:40:19] Peak it's hard to like keep you can't
[01:40:22] keep it forever you can't doesn't
[01:40:24] doesn't guess it depends heavily on your
[01:40:26] personality if we look at if we look at
[01:40:28] Formula 1 and we look at um was it
[01:40:34] Mickey lder was it Mickey L Nikki Nikki
[01:40:37] lder I feel like this is more ex n LA
[01:40:40] and what was the other guy John H John
[01:40:43] Hunt John Hunt yeah John Hunt we had
[01:40:45] this movie Rush about them and this and
[01:40:48] this dialogue I had I had this same
[01:40:49] dialogue with you ESS and actually it
[01:40:53] made quite a difference I asked yonas
[01:40:54] after his first win at the world memory
[01:40:56] Champion are you John Hunt or you Nikki
[01:40:59] lder because John Hunt won the Formula 1
[01:41:02] World memory championship and then he
[01:41:03] was done and Nikki louder worked and
[01:41:05] worked and worked and worked and he
[01:41:07] wanted continuously afterwards and it
[01:41:10] actually made a difference one year
[01:41:11] later yonas came to me and said if you
[01:41:13] wouldn't have told me that I would have
[01:41:16] settled and then yeah it's his it's his
[01:41:21] accomplishment not mine but um it made a
[01:41:23] difference it made a difference
[01:41:24] psychologically for him to to continue
[01:41:26] and and and practice and give it another
[01:41:28] shot and now since he won it
[01:41:31] twice I don't know if he's coming back
[01:41:33] or not but it's the weirdest everyone
[01:41:35] could I have to say impressive guy right
[01:41:37] now he just want to again in his Lance
[01:41:39] exactly let us concentrate on on the uh
[01:41:42] event here because he's running away
[01:41:43] with the group now they were close Boris
[01:41:45] and Lance but now it's uh he just beat
[01:41:48] him it's clear he's going to win his
[01:41:51] group look at this right Lance is really
[01:41:54] he's he's number one position with 33
[01:41:56] points no one else has done that so far
[01:41:58] here we go one more between highest
[01:42:00] others are having sharing 30 points
[01:42:02] johanes Simon
[01:42:04] p and johanes Shu so who's doing the
[01:42:07] best here who has the best record I
[01:42:08] guess Lance has the best record he's
[01:42:10] played one more match than everybody and
[01:42:12] the best recall I mean that's FJ
[01:42:17] interesting right 10 two yeah so great
[01:42:21] table we looking at right now it's Boris
[01:42:23] Conrad versus Lance TR both of them top
[01:42:26] memory athletes Boris was in the finals
[01:42:28] last year and he's very talked about
[01:42:31] this always
[01:42:32] so um visual about his losses and his
[01:42:36] winds and Lance is so completely
[01:42:39] unpredictable in his his body language
[01:42:41] also he's oh he's smiling he's kind of
[01:42:44] showing off right now he feels good
[01:42:47] that's good he does it's really good I'm
[01:42:49] happy for him and but it doesn't really
[01:42:51] come as a surprise I really I really
[01:42:54] think
[01:42:55] he he's gotten very comfortable with
[01:42:57] competition he's certainly a favorite um
[01:43:00] was he nervous at first oh he looked
[01:43:02] very nervous he's had very um like he's
[01:43:06] trained crazy amounts right probably
[01:43:08] more than anyone yeah and uh his first
[01:43:10] few competitions he tanked last year he
[01:43:14] didn't do very well at US championships
[01:43:16] he's kind of bombed even though he was
[01:43:19] putting up really amazing records scores
[01:43:22] but now it seems like he's a little more
[01:43:24] comfortable with himself in this situ
[01:43:26] and this is probably the most stressful
[01:43:29] kind of competition he's doing pretty
[01:43:31] solid solid during during the memo games
[01:43:33] last year shortly after the xmt he he
[01:43:36] went home during the competition he said
[01:43:39] sorry but he he broke one of the world
[01:43:41] records there I think he memorized the
[01:43:44] the memo cube faster than anyone else
[01:43:46] there in the field and then he said I
[01:43:48] got to go I can't do it anymore I to be
[01:43:50] honest it was quite it was quite
[01:43:53] exhausting because the US Open and memo
[01:43:55] games I I did them a few days after the
[01:43:57] xmt so all these guys were just
[01:43:59] basically for four days in a row look at
[01:44:01] this words bis goes for
[01:44:03] 46.69 which is insane if that's going to
[01:44:06] hold wow here we go I mean that we
[01:44:11] should have waited before we talk to
[01:44:13] Katie because this would is almost
[01:44:15] blowing it out by 10 seconds here we go
[01:44:18] let see he Boris knows that he can't get
[01:44:22] past Lance so I'm sure this is part of
[01:44:24] his reason for going so quick so it's
[01:44:26] either he got it or he was just going
[01:44:29] for whatever he could and see if he uh
[01:44:31] and he always they always start at the
[01:44:33] bottom yeah it's the last ones you look
[01:44:36] at you probably don't register them you
[01:44:38] just kind of look at them so you them
[01:44:43] in here we go oh yeah look at this the
[01:44:47] last word that that b screwed up Gira
[01:44:49] and AA that's a giraffe and a
[01:44:52] monkey right oh yeah and that monkey in
[01:44:55] German AFA that sounds so much like GFA
[01:44:59] so he just looked at it for such a such
[01:45:01] a short moment that he didn't even see
[01:45:04] it right he might get it might come back
[01:45:06] not be able to to fix that and he
[01:45:08] doesn't look very confident in typing in
[01:45:10] his results and look at boris's
[01:45:14] entire turned red johannas is
[01:45:19] 48.8539483 wow let's look at that
[01:45:21] Johannes is not really shying away here
[01:45:25] people know it's the end of the day
[01:45:26] there's money at at at stake and they
[01:45:29] want to break some records here I love
[01:45:30] it yeah that's what it's all
[01:45:34] about they don't they don't need to play
[01:45:36] it safe anymore now could you argue I
[01:45:39] was thinking about this could you argue
[01:45:40] now that the
[01:45:43] xmt is not only a cool interesting
[01:45:47] competition different but it's maybe
[01:45:49] helping push the the sport right I mean
[01:45:52] would you have opportunity from which
[01:45:54] angle push the sport in terms of the the
[01:45:57] limits the boundaries of what's possible
[01:45:59] right I
[01:46:00] think I I think the xmt is
[01:46:04] really good at that but no fans the mimo
[01:46:07] games are perfectly designed to go even
[01:46:09] higher than that because they don't no
[01:46:11] that's what you're supposed to say
[01:46:12] that's fine I disagree because uh on the
[01:46:15] other
[01:46:16] hand no no no no no I think I'm really
[01:46:19] because I the thing is I developed the m
[01:46:21] games after you already had the xmt and
[01:46:23] I was looking at the xmt and I was
[01:46:24] wondering okay how can we avoid that
[01:46:26] someone is making one mistake and the
[01:46:28] entire time doesn't count anymore so I
[01:46:31] wanted to take this entire element out
[01:46:33] of the disciplines and allow everyone to
[01:46:34] memorize just just go for it and
[01:46:36] completely ignore everything else and I
[01:46:40] think so what what event is that which
[01:46:42] one do you have I'm not I'm not sure I'm
[01:46:44] actually not sure if that that's
[01:46:45] actually true what I just said because
[01:46:48] okay because I what I did is I um
[01:46:51] instead of resetting the
[01:46:53] time I give a penalty time on top of
[01:46:56] that so you don't have to
[01:46:58] wor um so much about losing everything
[01:47:02] when you have when you have made one
[01:47:04] mistake I see because you still might be
[01:47:06] competitive with with that one on the
[01:47:09] other hand of course if you get 15
[01:47:11] seconds penalty time on top of your
[01:47:13] result one minute left that's not really
[01:47:15] a cool super cool time anyway anyhow so
[01:47:19] I don't know of course the xmt is force
[01:47:21] is struggling is pushing this the xmt is
[01:47:24] in terms of uh the length of the
[01:47:26] discipline also pushing that because you
[01:47:28] have one minute and you don't have to
[01:47:29] worry about anything when you just do
[01:47:31] one minute well the the reason I I bring
[01:47:33] it up is because you have this situation
[01:47:35] where johanes can now go for 40 seconds
[01:47:39] for something he normally wouldn't
[01:47:41] because he gets one shot at usually
[01:47:43] another championship I agree
[01:47:45] absolutely and if there's money on the
[01:47:47] line you know that's why they're both
[01:47:48] going for 50 no you're right beat the I
[01:47:52] think I think that that that term X andt
[01:47:54] is way Superior did you hear that
[01:47:55] everyone I didn't mean to like no no no
[01:47:58] it's it's true it's true I have to be I
[01:48:00] have to be realistic about this this is
[01:48:02] this is um because because now there's
[01:48:05] absolutely no pressure on them anymore
[01:48:07] so they can seconds left they have so
[01:48:08] many attempts that's also looks like CC
[01:48:10] beat joh if you have just one or two
[01:48:13] attempts you have to play it you have to
[01:48:15] play it somewhere sa CC beat johanes
[01:48:18] there we go John Hendrick beat b Ben
[01:48:22] Lance beat Boris even though Boris tried
[01:48:25] to go for the record yeah A New Beat
[01:48:27] clay he didn't he didn't do so bad
[01:48:30] actually was 37 he got there it it
[01:48:32] didn't look like the you we just saw two
[01:48:35] World Records so that doesn't impress me
[01:48:37] anymore yeah exactly it's 50 perfect or
[01:48:41] yeah 50 get out of
[01:48:45] here so how many how many matches are we
[01:48:47] still seeing here
[01:48:48] today this is we have 15 so I think
[01:48:52] there's one 15 left no no no 15 we are
[01:48:56] at match
[01:48:57] 153 and 54 so we have up until 180
[01:49:03] today so it's still still quite a few to
[01:49:06] go right right now it feels like it's
[01:49:09] it's over any second now it's not true
[01:49:10] they still and where should we go to
[01:49:13] extreme memory challenge.com do the
[01:49:16] challenge find out how amazing you are
[01:49:19] how your brain works
[01:49:20] maybe maybe Nelson we um you can tell us
[01:49:23] a little bit about it I need to we have
[01:49:26] mentioned it he has mentioned it 100
[01:49:28] times and today and that's good but
[01:49:30] maybe you can tell us a little bit more
[01:49:31] about it yeah sure so we're trying to
[01:49:32] get uh as many people as possible
[01:49:35] ideally a million
[01:49:37] or um sorry I'm just looking at that
[01:49:40] tweet from my fiance over there she said
[01:49:42] mind blown at extrem
[01:49:45] oh anyway so yeah it's it's it's a
[01:49:48] research project that Dart is doing the
[01:49:50] sponsor the competition they're trying
[01:49:51] to get a million people to take this
[01:49:53] test and the idea is the more people we
[01:49:55] have the more of a spectrum we can get
[01:49:59] for what memory looks like in the
[01:50:02] average population and we want to find
[01:50:04] and isolate people who have naturally
[01:50:06] good long-term memories it's basically
[01:50:08] the people that can do what we do um but
[01:50:11] remember things days later but naturally
[01:50:14] how long does it take the the challenge
[01:50:16] the challenge is uh it's it's like five
[01:50:18] to 10 minutes it's super easy um and
[01:50:20] there's two parts to it you do one on
[01:50:23] one day and then we remind you the
[01:50:24] second day you don't have to remember
[01:50:26] we'll remind you um seriously I'm going
[01:50:28] to do it tonight but it's great it's a
[01:50:30] good test to see how good you are um how
[01:50:32] close you can get to my score I won't
[01:50:35] tell you what it is um and uh yeah it's
[01:50:38] for a good cause and for research look
[01:50:40] at that look at that tweet I know that
[01:50:43] guy that's your brother that's my
[01:50:44] brother not a
[01:50:46] billionaire and it is true he is not
[01:50:48] he's a billionaire in
[01:50:50] there yet yet
[01:50:54] yeah well good I'll leave you guys to it
[01:50:57] I'm going to get back there and and and
[01:51:00] see if there'll be some other world
[01:51:01] records what do we have coming up I like
[01:51:04] but I like how the stage Alex has
[01:51:05] another set of cards well Simon now and
[01:51:08] Simon said Simon told me that he has
[01:51:11] never done anything like that in
[01:51:12] training like Alex did now in a
[01:51:15] competition yeah but of course since he
[01:51:17] was the world record holder before for
[01:51:19] such a long time and he was like the
[01:51:21] cards
[01:51:23] guy he he wants to do something about it
[01:51:26] he probably will not be able to do
[01:51:28] anything about it today but no
[01:51:31] um I think this is this is really
[01:51:35] motivating him I don't think that Simon
[01:51:37] will just give up like many others in
[01:51:39] the history of memory sorts have done
[01:51:41] before him and just accept the fact that
[01:51:44] someone else came and will be much
[01:51:46] better I think Simon
[01:51:47] will get get down on its button and and
[01:51:50] memorize a bit more and get it get the
[01:51:53] training a little bit different and but
[01:51:54] what I thought was that people get
[01:51:57] slower numbers later in the day they're
[01:52:00] getting even better right you see it's
[01:52:01] almost more like they warm up in the
[01:52:03] morning and they figure out where
[01:52:04] they're going to be in this competition
[01:52:06] and then at the end they just but maybe
[01:52:08] it's also part of of the strategy
[01:52:11] because in the beginning you just want
[01:52:12] to get your points just want to just
[01:52:15] want to play it safe in the morning and
[01:52:17] know since the people are getting yeah
[01:52:20] this is a track ball you need to use
[01:52:22] your thumb there all right let's watch
[01:52:25] I'm going to watch this match with you
[01:52:27] guys watch it so I want to see Alex
[01:52:30] let's go to Alex can we go to yep see
[01:52:33] how fast he goes through his cards here
[01:52:35] I think he's going to go
[01:52:37] crazy let's see Jesus he almost
[01:52:40] done oh my God come on come on come on
[01:52:46] come on come on
[01:52:48] oh no
[01:52:50] I don't know there's a bit of delay
[01:52:51] let's see what he gets ah
[01:52:53] 1.09 come on Al how slow is that what
[01:52:57] disappointment what a disappointment
[01:52:59] exactly oh he's
[01:53:02] upset 26 by qu a second slower than the
[01:53:06] record yeah look at everyone like even
[01:53:08] Everett beat that old record of 33
[01:53:10] seconds yeah I mean a sub30 second time
[01:53:14] now is so
[01:53:16] normal
[01:53:17] yeah it's insane
[01:53:20] that's sad but
[01:53:23] amazing yeah it's still amazing still
[01:53:25] feels like Mar 51 and so interesting
[01:53:29] that Simon is still going through it I
[01:53:32] wonder is he trying to be careful so
[01:53:34] that he
[01:53:36] wins does he need that win right now um
[01:53:39] I think he does well no he's already on
[01:53:41] to the next round yeah but maybe he
[01:53:44] doesn't I don't know maybe he wants
[01:53:47] to yeah he doesn't really his distance
[01:53:49] yeah stay on position number one or so
[01:53:53] who's your biggest surprise of the day
[01:53:55] I'd say Katie I mean she's always pretty
[01:53:58] solid but she's just been winning
[01:54:01] matches that usually she may not um
[01:54:04] she'd be doing awesome who else cc is
[01:54:07] doing awesome and Lance of course he's
[01:54:10] yeah um he's like I said before he's
[01:54:13] definitely gotten comfortable with
[01:54:15] himself in competitions I think we all
[01:54:17] knew that he was good just it was a
[01:54:20] question of could he do it in
[01:54:21] competition actually I'm pretty
[01:54:23] surprised by Marvin because he's now at
[01:54:26] position number three there in his round
[01:54:28] which is not the worst thing but yeah
[01:54:33] um doesn't really put them in a good
[01:54:35] position for tomorrow he will have to
[01:54:37] compete against one of the top a winner
[01:54:39] from uh one groups maybe he doesn't want
[01:54:42] to exhaust
[01:54:43] himself you're ready for
[01:54:47] tomorrow here we go
[01:54:50] can't believe he's going to get the
[01:54:51] second best record the thing with Alex
[01:54:53] is he's so consistent at that speed
[01:54:56] right that's really what's crazy I mean
[01:54:59] he's it looks like he's getting a bunch
[01:55:00] wrong but I guarantee he's going to
[01:55:01] shift those over and they'll be correct
[01:55:03] right while Simon when we looked at his
[01:55:05] history of doing speed cards either in a
[01:55:08] competition
[01:55:09] or in a show on on television every
[01:55:12] time you are never really sure about
[01:55:15] what's going to happen where Alex is
[01:55:17] just getting through with that yeah
[01:55:19] Simon already
[01:55:22] finished how did you do oh 52 and 56.84
[01:55:26] seconds L was a safe so Marvin will have
[01:55:31] to compete against Alex if it stays like
[01:55:34] it is
[01:55:35] now will be a nice rematch from the the
[01:55:38] world championship that's
[01:55:42] exactly we have two minutes left in the
[01:55:46] recall so that would be intense actually
[01:55:50] e just beat yeah janja he oh that's big
[01:55:54] I don't know what his I think he's six
[01:55:56] and six so now he's seven and six so
[01:55:58] they'll be tied actually what's his
[01:55:59] percent recall oh he's well it might
[01:56:03] increase yeah yeah I think he might move
[01:56:05] above so he might wow yja was at the top
[01:56:09] remember she was undefeated right she
[01:56:10] was the best of all of them for six
[01:56:13] matches or something like that yeah oh
[01:56:15] at five she was at 15 points and then
[01:56:18] she she didn't get many more Point all
[01:56:20] right
[01:56:21] Alex have 80 seconds
[01:56:24] left can we switch to Alex's screen
[01:56:27] let's go to Table
[01:56:28] [Music]
[01:56:37] Three I move some of those over let's
[01:56:40] see I'm sure he's going to figure it out
[01:56:45] yep yeah I mean this kind of system that
[01:56:47] that he's using is also very beneficial
[01:56:51] of um eliminating mistakes because when
[01:56:56] you have something something like this
[01:56:58] mistake that he has there then he will
[01:57:01] he will um have some few cards remaining
[01:57:05] that that don't make sense to him yeah
[01:57:07] so that gives him a clue that something
[01:57:09] is something is off there and he might
[01:57:13] be able
[01:57:14] to to put it into position although it
[01:57:17] doesn't really look like it right now
[01:57:19] yeah looks like he's 20 seconds going to
[01:57:21] be stuck with
[01:57:24] that I guess he's better when it's a bit
[01:57:28] faster five seconds
[01:57:31] yeah oh yep so looks like Shir just beat
[01:57:35] him right see that
[01:57:39] record sh well okay three and 10 that's
[01:57:45] it there we
[01:57:48] go so we
[01:57:51] have Simon getting another Point mavin
[01:57:53] getting another Point very important for
[01:57:55] him and Everett beating janja o and
[01:57:58] they're off she's beating him by 03 of a
[01:58:01] percent recall better
[01:58:05] than but that's a close game still have
[01:58:08] a couple more
[01:58:10] events and
[01:58:12] and barar now qualified for
[01:58:16] tomorrow as well that she already did
[01:58:20] she has the opportunity to win her group
[01:58:21] even she's close she's really close
[01:58:24] behind she might beat the number one in
[01:58:26] the world that's right it's always
[01:58:28] confusing to say number one in the world
[01:58:30] if you have the world memory Champion if
[01:58:32] you have the xmt champion if you have
[01:58:34] the world rankings right now it's only
[01:58:35] the
[01:58:36] XT Friday let's forget about all this
[01:58:39] other stuff there we're starting
[01:58:42] over there is no World by the way we I
[01:58:44] was I was about to talk about this
[01:58:46] earlier and then somehow we got
[01:58:48] interrupted
[01:58:50] we have started the International
[01:58:51] Association of memory the oh yeah the
[01:58:54] xmt is the very first memory
[01:58:56] Championship that is running under the
[01:58:58] new Banner wow of a democratic free
[01:59:03] awesome memory memory association
[01:59:06] association exactly which will something
[01:59:07] that cares about the the competitors
[01:59:10] except for um instead of instead of
[01:59:12] looting them yeah
[01:59:15] so we will we will do a lot of cool
[01:59:18] stuff with that in the future we'll be
[01:59:20] exploring your competition this one
[01:59:23] possibly International versions of ours
[01:59:26] exactly um Ben is already planning a new
[01:59:28] thing top secret has a few ideas uh
[01:59:32] which is great so I love this idea that
[01:59:34] we can experiment with different kinds
[01:59:37] of memory competitions and try to create
[01:59:38] One Umbrella that uh tries to promote
[01:59:42] the athletes which I think this is what
[01:59:44] the sport is all about it's not about
[01:59:46] the the people who
[01:59:49] sit there with
[01:59:51] their fists under their chin the the the
[01:59:55] S the sarcasm in that room is so thick
[01:59:57] you can cut it um I think what's also
[02:00:01] very important to mention is that the I
[02:00:04] am is being supported by the best memory
[02:00:06] athletes in the world from all from all
[02:00:08] countries all over the world they're
[02:00:09] supported by Arbiters by top Arbiters
[02:00:12] from all over the world by the
[02:00:13] organizers by fans this is not just some
[02:00:17] something that you have in
[02:00:20] in in inboxing where all of a sudden you
[02:00:22] have all these different organizations
[02:00:24] and everyone is doing everything this is
[02:00:27] it yeah this is what we are doing this
[02:00:29] is it we are I'm sure we will be able to
[02:00:33] get the most out of it maybe join world
[02:00:35] rankings people were talking about this
[02:00:36] for such a long time imagine how cool
[02:00:38] that would be that everyone here today
[02:00:40] would improve their rankings by
[02:00:42] competing at the xmt that would give the
[02:00:45] xmt so much more value than it already
[02:00:48] has as being the coolest fastest
[02:00:50] craziest of all of them but putting them
[02:00:52] into the world rankings you can play any
[02:00:54] competition and it it adds or detracts
[02:00:57] from your your your overall World ring
[02:00:59] that's that's the dream right next next
[02:01:01] week we have the US Open being the the
[02:01:04] first traditional one under the um IM
[02:01:06] Banner memo games is up from now on
[02:01:09] under the IM banner I have contacted M
[02:01:13] duar from from the memorial today nice
[02:01:17] uh or was it yesterday I did
[02:01:20] and he already he already responded very
[02:01:22] well that he is looking forward to work
[02:01:24] with us and and do something about
[02:01:26] memory and also mental mental Sports so
[02:01:30] all these big championships they're all
[02:01:32] coming together I was contacted from a
[02:01:34] Brazilian who wants to do a new memory
[02:01:36] championship in Brazil which is
[02:01:38] fantastic because we don't have anything
[02:01:39] in South America nothing there's this
[02:01:42] one Championship is kind of under the
[02:01:43] radar in Colombia and I'm sure they're
[02:01:45] they're happy to to work with us as well
[02:01:49] this is this is really
[02:01:51] exciting let's have a look here the
[02:01:53] fastest here we have Yan with
[02:02:17] 19.84% in the wrong positions right if
[02:02:21] you see that right you have those two
[02:02:24] those over here uh well these two I
[02:02:27] don't know where those go so she has a
[02:02:29] bit of rearranging to do but she's got
[02:02:31] the pairs right it seems but look at him
[02:02:33] he just finished so when we look at all
[02:02:36] when at all these number three and
[02:02:38] marwin just won
[02:02:41] positions um none of none of them are
[02:02:44] safe in on day two
[02:02:46] yet right the ones that are in yellow
[02:02:49] still that's correct the ones that are
[02:02:53] yellow um well the number twos are kind
[02:02:56] of kind of secure not really secure when
[02:02:58] we look at sangi and Marvin they kind of
[02:02:59] have the same points there and so I have
[02:03:01] JN Johan Everett but nevertheless the
[02:03:03] number three doesn't necessarily go to
[02:03:05] day two it depends there are only four
[02:03:08] slots for the number threes right it's
[02:03:10] the best threes but I mean you can tell
[02:03:11] right the green is telling you they for
[02:03:14] sure have made it but when we look now
[02:03:15] at the number threes we only have four
[02:03:17] spots you have HRI B we have Marvin
[02:03:20] bonio we have
[02:03:21] a and we have Marlo Knight that is 1 2 3
[02:03:25] four
[02:03:26] plus well the blue ones are already like
[02:03:29] they don't have any chance anymore or
[02:03:31] what is that no they they do uh they're
[02:03:33] just at the bottom it's just uh right so
[02:03:36] the yellow ones are at the moment in the
[02:03:39] top at have the chance to go to the
[02:03:43] finals where the blue ones don't have
[02:03:45] enough points to make it if the game was
[02:03:47] over now but still there's still stuff
[02:03:51] going on but if we look at at all the
[02:03:53] light
[02:03:54] blue athletes they
[02:03:58] are they are missing so many points
[02:04:01] already Johan Randall abrina two points
[02:04:04] behind Maro it's kind of the closest
[02:04:06] ones from all of those that are behind
[02:04:10] probably the only one who might still be
[02:04:12] able to do it she at 26 constructing it
[02:04:15] yep she has two swaps yep two swaps
[02:04:18] that's it
[02:04:19] this could be a big win where is she
[02:04:21] janja really wants that I like either
[02:04:24] one but ever because he's 15 oh here she
[02:04:27] goes she knows something is wrong oh no
[02:04:30] she's really switching it whoa let's see
[02:04:31] what she does
[02:04:34] here she's making how do you do that
[02:04:36] what they do that they move everything
[02:04:38] to the side uh I believe it's a plus and
[02:04:42] minus so you click on one image and then
[02:04:44] you click plus and it moves to the right
[02:04:45] and you click on minus moves to the left
[02:04:47] exactly yeah can we do that in training
[02:04:49] at home as well the instructions are on
[02:04:52] page I never read them here we go look
[02:04:55] this table
[02:04:56] four ping out going for it Everett wow
[02:05:00] he's
[02:05:02] done still struggling 10 seconds left
[02:05:06] will not flinch when he wins he is
[02:05:09] so keeps it all together he he really
[02:05:12] has has Champion qualities in any way
[02:05:15] yeah he's pretty Stone Cold look at him
[02:05:17] he just won
[02:05:19] yep see oh no he reacted a little bit
[02:05:21] that was a quick uh
[02:05:24] handshake that's amazing let's look at
[02:05:25] the standings now what's now that puts
[02:05:28] him in front of yan and now Alex has
[02:05:31] secured his spot Alex is now in the
[02:05:33] finals and look who's finally finally
[02:05:37] Simon and Lance are tie with the best
[02:05:38] score but Lance has a better recall so
[02:05:42] he Lance still has the best y record
[02:05:45] overall incredible it'll still be
[02:05:47] interesting to see him in the the the
[02:05:50] playoff rounds tomorrow even though I
[02:05:52] say that he's kind of got he's never
[02:05:54] done something like that before right
[02:05:56] wow he did this last year and I think he
[02:06:00] got the feel for it so now he's good at
[02:06:01] that but he's never gone face to face
[02:06:03] with someone and with surprise events
[02:06:05] which right he's told me he's he hates
[02:06:07] and he's not very good at so that'll be
[02:06:10] interesting to see how he does that
[02:06:12] right right all right I'm going to head
[02:06:14] back in there this thing up a pleasure
[02:06:16] we'll try to send some folks in for you
[02:06:18] thank you yeah please send them in keep
[02:06:21] them
[02:06:21] coming keep them coming I must say I'm
[02:06:25] I'm very exhausted right now I am too I
[02:06:27] I feel I feel a little bit like I was
[02:06:29] memorizing all day and no my head hurts
[02:06:32] I get migraines and I can't look at a
[02:06:33] screen for that long it's amazing here
[02:06:35] we are wow we look exhausted we're
[02:06:38] sweating we're tired but you know what
[02:06:40] we're fighting through this because we
[02:06:41] saw some world records and it was
[02:06:43] incredible it was really incredible this
[02:06:45] my first day ever so yeah I'm loving it
[02:06:50] I I love it even more wow you have to
[02:06:52] always beat me I love it even I don't
[02:06:56] love it even more than you love it I
[02:06:58] love it would you wear these glasses
[02:07:00] during the comp I laughed it
[02:07:03] before would you wear these these block
[02:07:07] I'm coming I'll I'll be back I'll be
[02:07:11] back I think I think I make a
[02:07:14] better
[02:07:17] terminat because I because I actually
[02:07:19] speak the language that this guy speaks
[02:07:21] but you're not Austrian except for the
[02:07:24] muscles I don't have them but that's
[02:07:25] okay I have he's Austrian you're German
[02:07:29] yeah but we speak the same language
[02:07:30] although his his German sounds funny and
[02:07:34] honestly I I never understood he doesn't
[02:07:36] speak he doesn't speak Austrian he
[02:07:37] speaks German yeah yeah and anyhow let's
[02:07:41] not talk about that it's like Spanish
[02:07:43] people they have a little accent yeah
[02:07:45] it's true I mean I I speak now Costa
[02:07:47] Rican Spanish which is pretty cool
[02:07:50] because they have they have they have so
[02:07:51] much cool slang there and they don't
[02:07:54] have this they don't speak like this no
[02:07:57] people from this is from people from
[02:07:58] Spain Spain they don't do
[02:08:02] that
[02:08:04] argentin AR Argentina nine we had just
[02:08:08] we just confirmed we we had close to
[02:08:10] 1,000 views here tell your friends tell
[02:08:12] all your friends to tune in now tell
[02:08:13] your friends tell your uncles tell your
[02:08:15] aunts tell your mother we will have a
[02:08:17] four digigit viewer count here this is
[02:08:20] it's going to get even bigger tomorrow
[02:08:22] and the next day and in the future
[02:08:24] exactly in the future we will have
[02:08:28] 1,1 and maybe we'll be promoting some
[02:08:31] alcohol I'm just kidding no where are we
[02:08:33] going um right let's concentrate I'm I'm
[02:08:37] so unconcentrated right now there was
[02:08:39] all too much makes sense it's
[02:08:41] 4:30 all right memorization starts what
[02:08:44] do we have here parafia versus Melanie
[02:08:47] um vessel we're rooting for vessel right
[02:08:49] now he is just one hell of a kid very
[02:08:52] nice guy vers Katie who's dominant right
[02:08:54] now johanis who's killing it versus
[02:08:56] Marlo who's not too shabby but he's
[02:08:58] pretty pretty good and Johan vers
[02:09:02] Christian
[02:09:06] right I feel like I'd be good at the
[02:09:13] names you know um I'm always confused
[02:09:17] why none of these athletes are using a
[02:09:19] names database they don't prepare they
[02:09:21] don't prepare these names they don't say
[02:09:23] oh he's David and David reminds them of
[02:09:26] David versus goth so they can use the
[02:09:28] sling as an object symbol for
[02:09:31] David they just look at David and they
[02:09:33] use something they came up through
[02:09:36] repetitive training but everyone out
[02:09:38] there honestly if you want to if if
[02:09:40] you're just starting with memory
[02:09:41] techniques or you are already a memory
[02:09:43] athlete and you are really bad at names
[02:09:46] think about it just just Google Google
[02:09:48] the most common names from your area
[02:09:52] maybe whether you're coming from the
[02:09:53] United States or wherever that you might
[02:09:55] be from just Google them there all there
[02:09:57] are so many lists out there and then you
[02:09:59] encode these names step by step into
[02:10:01] images that you that you pre-make and
[02:10:04] you memorize them and next time you see
[02:10:06] the name you you will just think for a
[02:10:08] split second and you have an image there
[02:10:10] and you can immediately memorize it none
[02:10:12] of our athletes are doing that because
[02:10:15] they were just going through the painful
[02:10:16] experience of doing over and over and
[02:10:19] over again until they got
[02:10:20] good so Christian just did your method
[02:10:25] 59.3 seconds he clicked right before
[02:10:29] right I wouldn't call it my method they
[02:10:30] already did that last year
[02:10:33] actually if you want to if you want to
[02:10:35] give me any method it would be faster
[02:10:36] than 59 so something between something
[02:10:39] below 57 actually slightly below 57
[02:10:42] maybe 53 to 57 something in that area I
[02:10:46] think is strategically
[02:10:49] pretty pretty secure in terms of you
[02:10:52] don't have to go super fast but you
[02:10:55] still beat those guys who think doing 59
[02:10:58] 58 or 57 is good enough because you will
[02:11:02] be slightly better in times but you
[02:11:05] still had all the time to memorize the
[02:11:07] stuff right so but not many people did
[02:11:10] that here Johannes did that now he has
[02:11:12] 52 but look at this so we should really
[02:11:14] look at Marlo and Christian cuz if Marlo
[02:11:17] wins andr loses then it's going to be
[02:11:20] very close one can move up one can move
[02:11:22] down in the rankings Christian's at in
[02:11:25] second place and Marlo's in third in
[02:11:27] group
[02:11:30] F so at table three
[02:11:34] Marlo is
[02:11:37] [Music]
[02:11:38] down let's
[02:11:40] see come on
[02:11:43] vessel he's being he's playing against a
[02:11:45] Powerhouse right now on ktie right
[02:11:55] now we just wait and
[02:11:56] listen you know what I think these
[02:11:59] Spectators chairs they shouldn't be in
[02:12:01] the room or they should it should be
[02:12:03] arranged somehow differently because now
[02:12:04] we look at that and there's there's no
[02:12:06] one sitting there it kind of gives a
[02:12:08] wrong it gives a wrong no that's true
[02:12:11] and you see people yawning and idea to
[02:12:14] people they think ah no one is watching
[02:12:15] it and I mean no they are there so many
[02:12:18] watching this they're watching us right
[02:12:19] now they're watching we don't allow that
[02:12:20] many people in here exactly you have to
[02:12:22] you have to fulfill some very strong
[02:12:25] test have a bloodline you know the
[02:12:27] bloodline yeah doesn't sound right at
[02:12:30] all doesn't really you got to be related
[02:12:34] to one of the athletes
[02:12:38] the the bloodline cousin Fifth Fifth
[02:12:46] Grade right right so um so Katie just
[02:12:51] finished vessel can tie
[02:12:53] her Katie just did 30 names
[02:12:57] there which is brilliant because when we
[02:13:00] look at the names uh it's
[02:13:04] still uh that would be a world record
[02:13:07] then so look at
[02:13:11] that we just made it to uh 1,000 views
[02:13:14] hooray congratulations thank you very
[02:13:17] much for tuning to the xmt live stream
[02:13:20] extreme memory tournament 2016 my
[02:13:25] fantastic co-host here today Max berz
[02:13:27] wanted to tell you something about our
[02:13:30] sponsor yes so go to extreme memory
[02:13:33] challenge.com take the challenge do the
[02:13:37] test it takes 5 to 10 minutes we'll
[02:13:39] figure out how smart you are no I'm just
[02:13:41] kid but it will really help find out
[02:13:44] what goes on with your memory and they
[02:13:48] want 1 million people to take this test
[02:13:51] so okay and now let's look at Katie
[02:13:54] because three more seconds for a new
[02:13:55] world record boom here it is 30 names no
[02:14:00] mistakes she's being first person in the
[02:14:03] history look at vessel he's so happy for
[02:14:06] her doing that he should win a Mis
[02:14:10] Congeniality yeah vess vessel is really
[02:14:12] a cool guy I hope he's I hope he's
[02:14:14] returning to us very soon to um I think
[02:14:18] she's going to pass out her she's so
[02:14:20] excited she has she just broke another
[02:14:22] she's like breaking one record after
[02:14:24] another and then she's beating her own
[02:14:26] record after she did that so this is
[02:14:29] fantastic this is beautiful look at this
[02:14:31] she just she just memorized Mike Gregory
[02:14:33] Candace Cheryl probie Dorothy Amanda it
[02:14:35] takes me longer to name all of them
[02:14:38] memorize them MH this is beautiful wow
[02:14:42] this is beautiful you go kitty we're
[02:14:44] going to have to talk to you again yeah
[02:14:46] get in here
[02:14:49] man what a match so far what a match I
[02:14:52] mean tomorrow will be super
[02:14:54] exciting but they honestly that they
[02:14:57] have to work to to Ane this up what they
[02:15:00] did here today and this was just the
[02:15:02] first day they they're not even in the
[02:15:04] finals yet so wow but on the other hand
[02:15:07] when we look at what happened last year
[02:15:10] day one also got more records coming in
[02:15:12] because people had more games more
[02:15:14] matches it
[02:15:16] wasn't it wasn't so intense because here
[02:15:20] they have the group system they can up
[02:15:21] second even third yeah and they still
[02:15:24] get into the finals while tomorrow they
[02:15:27] cannot do that just look at this look at
[02:15:29] vessel he's he's crying he's crying of
[02:15:33] joy that he was that he was there at the
[02:15:36] table with KY W where we going to now
[02:15:40] going to Table Three
[02:15:44] Marlo so how did that turn off ring
[02:15:46] completely distracted by another world
[02:15:48] record here so how did that turn out for
[02:15:50] Marlo so Christian won Marlo lost so
[02:15:55] Christian's right Chris basically cting
[02:15:59] cementing himself here at position
[02:16:01] number two in group f look at Everett
[02:16:02] now eight and
[02:16:04] six Everett is now on position number
[02:16:06] two I missed that part that was can he
[02:16:09] win today or no no he
[02:16:11] can't there one there's one one one more
[02:16:14] event that will give him a maximum of 27
[02:16:17] points Alex is in the lead with 30 ex
[02:16:19] say there's only one more and he doesn't
[02:16:21] want to win he doesn't want to win
[02:16:23] because if he is in second position he
[02:16:25] will have a much um well he will have a
[02:16:29] less higher
[02:16:31] ranked um opponent in the morning when
[02:16:35] he's going into the the best out of 16
[02:16:39] or the Octo finals like we call it in
[02:16:42] Europe octo finals the Octo finals
[02:16:46] yeah so
[02:16:48] so it's vessel's still happy because he
[02:16:51] doesn't have the worst record right now
[02:16:54] and we know we know Johnny does but we
[02:16:56] know he was tired he was just on a show
[02:16:59] and we don't know if he made to the next
[02:17:00] round but right seems like he
[02:17:04] did wow this is all brilliant really
[02:17:07] brilliant BR people out here today and
[02:17:10] now we see another round of group E and
[02:17:12] group F again with KT versus vessel for
[02:17:17] example
[02:17:18] and um if ktie is winning this
[02:17:24] then she has now 13 matches she can she
[02:17:28] can come even with Pia when if he is
[02:17:31] losing now no
[02:17:34] no uh but again it's it would she would
[02:17:38] be better off if she stays where she is
[02:17:40] I guess uh always he loses his next two
[02:17:42] match depends um group E winner would go
[02:17:46] against group be runner up which is
[02:17:48] Runner Up's number three right y so no
[02:17:51] yeah um no Runner Up's number
[02:17:54] two right what's not what's what they
[02:17:56] call this oh yeah they call this third
[02:17:58] place so Runner with number two that
[02:18:00] would be at the
[02:18:02] moment um
[02:18:06] Boris so that's pretty tough
[02:18:09] actually o vessel got 49.4 four seconds
[02:18:14] KD has 60 seconds right now and the Rec
[02:18:17] call starts right
[02:18:23] now Kitty starting from the bottom and
[02:18:27] so is vessel vessel start from a weird
[02:18:29] spot yeah probably because he already
[02:18:32] forgot that 7566 there yeah so he was
[02:18:37] going backwards
[02:18:41] but what did he do there probably
[02:18:44] skipped the location or something do you
[02:18:46] think their hands are tired
[02:18:49] from typing I think I think it's rather
[02:18:52] their brains are tired after such a long
[02:18:55] day I think the the hands still keep up
[02:18:58] to the task but some of them are
[02:19:00] probably already drifting away with
[02:19:01] their minds because this is this so
[02:19:04] intense here we go look at vessel he's
[02:19:06] he's doing pretty
[02:19:09] well but Katie's got a clean slate right
[02:19:12] here she's all green on her green green
[02:19:14] Green then so far that's that's always
[02:19:17] promising if you have that 60 4 five
[02:19:21] there you go 8
[02:19:22] 1 look at Katy
[02:19:26] go oh she's
[02:19:29] stuck but she's got two minutes and 45
[02:19:31] seconds
[02:19:33] right and Al looks like he might he
[02:19:37] might um Take the Lead even further he
[02:19:40] still has some some and he got it but
[02:19:42] Melanie no but Melanie might beat him
[02:19:45] right she only got four digits and she
[02:19:48] has a fantastic time that 34 seconds
[02:19:52] believe that that's so fast it's amazing
[02:19:54] for 80 digits that's really fast even
[02:19:58] even among these other super memorizers
[02:20:01] here this is a brilliant time if we look
[02:20:03] at best scores in in numbers look so
[02:20:06] confident look at him that
[02:20:08] is only eight other people did a fosta
[02:20:12] time before uh oh she put two numbers in
[02:20:15] they are completely off
[02:20:21] Johannes beat Marlo it's
[02:20:27] confirmed Christian is
[02:20:29] still winning but Johan could win you
[02:20:32] never
[02:20:33] know yeah it doesn't really look look
[02:20:36] good for him though and vessel is down
[02:20:39] right now so Melanie vessel Johan those
[02:20:42] three are really they're giving the best
[02:20:44] and they're doing so brilliant even okay
[02:20:47] just switch it around despite where they
[02:20:49] are at the championship right now
[02:20:52] but come on come on I think they they
[02:20:55] don't have a chance anymore
[02:20:57] here come on
[02:21:01] Melanie getting those last three digits
[02:21:05] remaining two images in her memory
[02:21:08] system she's using a two-digit major
[02:21:11] system and I think she puts two of these
[02:21:13] images together in one location so this
[02:21:15] is basically one
[02:21:17] loai that she is working at right now
[02:21:21] trying to figure out what was going on
[02:21:23] there and uh vessel he's down in the
[02:21:26] count but Kitty he she has a perfect
[02:21:29] score all
[02:21:35] green 40 seconds
[02:21:38] left well it's getting it's getting
[02:21:40] really tight from Malo
[02:21:42] now is he going to win this one no
[02:21:45] already L losing he's losing that one
[02:21:48] against johanes so it will be tough for
[02:21:51] him to get that that
[02:21:53] important that important slot on
[02:21:56] position number three because at the
[02:21:57] moment Jan hendrik
[02:21:59] sangam and Yan have seven points well he
[02:22:03] has five that he's that puts him on the
[02:22:05] lowest end of the four slots in the
[02:22:08] third place that still can make it into
[02:22:10] the finals so at the moment Malo is
[02:22:13] struggling
[02:22:14] against anudari two one it's done Katie
[02:22:19] just beat vessel again she is on fire
[02:22:25] right actually
[02:22:28] Melanie can still make it no because she
[02:22:32] has four points Maro has five points
[02:22:33] Maro lost this game Melanie can win the
[02:22:36] last game Maro can lose the last game
[02:22:38] Melanie's percentage is higher than the
[02:22:41] one from Marlo if Maro loses the next
[02:22:43] game and Melanie wins the next game they
[02:22:46] will be tied five wins and Melanie has
[02:22:49] more percentage and putting Marlo out of
[02:22:52] the four slots that can make it into the
[02:22:54] next
[02:22:55] day so it looks like Johnny will be
[02:22:57] sitting next to us
[02:22:59] tomorrow that's that's that's pretty
[02:23:01] given he us he might too same for Ben
[02:23:04] same for clay anudari can still make it
[02:23:07] she can uh she can win this then she
[02:23:11] clearly will get the slot from Maro if
[02:23:13] Maro loses the next one so if anudari
[02:23:16] wins
[02:23:17] the next one she will have six points if
[02:23:20] then Marlo wins he will also have six
[02:23:23] wins um no I mean need six points but
[02:23:26] six wins so if God there's so much
[02:23:29] calculation around so anudari wins Maro
[02:23:32] wins Maro will be in the lead because he
[02:23:33] has a better percentage if anadari wins
[02:23:36] Maru
[02:23:37] loses anadari goes into the finals if
[02:23:41] anari loses if Marlo loses and if
[02:23:43] Melanie wins Melanie will be finals if
[02:23:47] this person wins if this person ties if
[02:23:49] this there is there is still there is
[02:23:51] still a lot of stuff going on even
[02:23:53] though the top competitors have already
[02:23:54] been qualified for the next day so
[02:23:57] there's a lot of yellow yeah but these
[02:23:59] yellow ones are um a lot of them are
[02:24:02] between position number two and three so
[02:24:04] it's about if Marvin and S yeah but if
[02:24:07] Marvin and S San are fighting about
[02:24:11] position number two but both of them
[02:24:12] will make it to the finals because they
[02:24:14] have enough points no one can take that
[02:24:16] from them anymore Everett and yja they
[02:24:18] have enough points it's just about who
[02:24:20] of them will be number two and three in
[02:24:21] the group so no one can take it from
[02:24:23] them anymore um Yan hendrik has seven
[02:24:27] points no one can take it from him
[02:24:28] anymore so it's all about those blue
[02:24:30] ones which are actually not yellow at
[02:24:31] the moment because Melanie is blue
[02:24:34] anadari is blue but they can turn yellow
[02:24:36] again when everything happens that I
[02:24:38] just said look if Katy was in another
[02:24:40] group she'd be a winner she be not a
[02:24:42] winner but she'd be in first place in
[02:24:44] group a could be right yep Group D but
[02:24:47] actually all all eyes hey what's going
[02:24:50] and there is Nelson the camera switches
[02:24:52] to us and he he appears out of nothing
[02:24:55] we were just we were just speculating
[02:24:57] what's going on with with the last
[02:24:59] position the last one is at the moment
[02:25:00] Malo he is in the um yellow spot third
[02:25:04] position five wins but anod Dari has one
[02:25:06] more match she can make it and she got
[02:25:08] six if she wins and Maro loses she gets
[02:25:11] into the third if she loses and Maro
[02:25:15] wins he will get there if she loses
[02:25:17] loses and Melanie wins Melanie gets it
[02:25:19] because she has a better percentage than
[02:25:20] Marlo has oh there you go yeah yeah so
[02:25:23] the it's I think the top parts are
[02:25:24] pretty much set it's now these bottom
[02:25:26] ones that are fighting for their lives
[02:25:28] to be in the right in those last few
[02:25:30] spots of third place exactly he on
[02:25:32] Henrik Marvin s Everett and yja they
[02:25:34] don't have to worry about anymore it's
[02:25:36] just about which position they get in
[02:25:38] the end the ones who are definitely out
[02:25:41] are Johnny Ben and vessel yep and Clay
[02:25:45] I'd say yes clay
[02:25:47] exactly and Y and Johan and joh so yeah
[02:25:52] the bottom the bottom ones in each of
[02:25:55] the group I'd say are out and now it's
[02:25:57] kind of those yeah they're fighting for
[02:25:59] those last third place spots so what do
[02:26:01] we see here now the most interesting one
[02:26:05] now is anadari versus Lance because she
[02:26:06] must win it in order to get that that
[02:26:08] point so and I feel like Lance is
[02:26:11] probably going to go for he was so close
[02:26:13] last time
[02:26:15] 13.97 seconds for his images so wants
[02:26:19] those $2,000 he's going to go for it
[02:26:21] which could bode well for anadari if she
[02:26:23] just gets a solid I would just go for a
[02:26:26] 60-second safe run right so let us let
[02:26:29] us focus on table number on camera
[02:26:32] number two which is table number four
[02:26:35] four there yes exactly the camera's
[02:26:38] already zooming in there there's the
[02:26:40] newspaper there's the newspaper crazy
[02:26:42] hair here we go now let's see does the
[02:26:45] Yan Hendrick match have any like that's
[02:26:47] a teddy bear again um let's see right
[02:26:49] here y does y HRI need to win y HRI only
[02:26:52] only to it's important but no he's
[02:26:55] already this is this is really that
[02:26:59] anaran match is really exactly this is
[02:27:01] the only
[02:27:03] really CL is probably going to go balls
[02:27:06] to the wall here the other one still can
[02:27:09] can do records there technically now I
[02:27:11] think they clay knows and Boris knows
[02:27:13] that this is just and here we start
[02:27:15] let's go let's go to
[02:27:17] Lance exactly we already see them there
[02:27:20] so here are the images flying through
[02:27:22] Lance is like going crazy fast through
[02:27:24] the images anari taking it Taking it oh
[02:27:27] man 1.91 that would be a world record if
[02:27:31] he can 13 anudari did go interestingly
[02:27:35] for a 1 that was a
[02:27:37] very risky move actually and look at
[02:27:40] table number three we have two 13 second
[02:27:44] oh this is insane inred anari really
[02:27:46] should have gone for the entire 60
[02:27:48] seconds here that that
[02:27:51] strategically didn't make any sense that
[02:27:53] she did that she probably didn't see
[02:27:55] that Lance was flicking up his blue
[02:27:58] border indication that he was already
[02:28:00] done but she could have anticipated that
[02:28:02] he's and banner taking their time so if
[02:28:04] I would have been an odari in this
[02:28:06] position I wouldn't even try to go fast
[02:28:09] I would just from from the beginning try
[02:28:10] to do super secure and hope that Lance
[02:28:13] is screwing up yeah that would have her
[02:28:15] be her on our only
[02:28:17] or try to beat the time of course but
[02:28:19] Lance could break the record too so we
[02:28:21] we have four opportunities here for to
[02:28:23] win the oh wow look at these other times
[02:28:26] I didn't see that bis and Clay did that
[02:28:27] and three of those the 13 seconders can
[02:28:30] be world records right so since Anu Dari
[02:28:34] has now that problem with the time I
[02:28:36] guess the the camera is now already
[02:28:38] showing the even more interesting game
[02:28:40] between clay and Boris now because both
[02:28:42] of them have this incredible time which
[02:28:44] are both faster than Lance even who's
[02:28:46] going going to win who's going to beat
[02:28:48] the record I think I'm most excited to
[02:28:50] see boris's celebration if you get yeah
[02:28:52] come on let's get Boris in here actually
[02:28:54] we should we should switch off our
[02:28:56] microphones here and get the get the
[02:28:58] sound through the through the
[02:29:00] camera we could do that but then the
[02:29:03] audience cannot hear us for a moment
[02:29:04] that's fine it'll be fine for me right
[02:29:06] because it's more interesting to hear
[02:29:08] Boris cheer than to to us say Well done
[02:29:12] great new word record something I think
[02:29:14] clay needs a two either one he's already
[02:29:17] doing some mistakes there Boris is still
[02:29:19] up in green Lance is all up in green as
[02:29:22] well but they are both not super fast
[02:29:27] recalling there is looking good steadily
[02:29:28] go coming there bars did his
[02:29:31] first mistake
[02:29:33] okay but nothing is and look at these
[02:29:35] images that Boris has there that these
[02:29:38] are they look very similar don't they
[02:29:41] right next to each other where is that
[02:29:42] that's like no well he's off by one so
[02:29:46] so maybe he'll swap that in the end
[02:29:48] we'll
[02:29:49] see by the way everyone um we didn't
[02:29:53] really have the chance to show all these
[02:29:54] cool Champion cards that I created today
[02:29:57] um I put them I put them in the in the
[02:30:00] break I uploaded them on the memory
[02:30:01] sports.com Facebook web page everyone
[02:30:04] who's on Facebook you can get them there
[02:30:05] I couldn't do it on the X but we can
[02:30:07] upload them there later as well yeah
[02:30:09] sure um so everyone who's interested in
[02:30:11] the systems of our athletes you can go
[02:30:13] on memory sports.com fan page on let's
[02:30:16] go to Lance Facebook table table
[02:30:20] four table four he could do it he's got
[02:30:24] a lot of time left no well everyone of
[02:30:26] them still can do it this one mistake
[02:30:28] from Boris can easily be
[02:30:32] correct yeah Lance has 28 he's going to
[02:30:35] get it he got it he got it got that's
[02:30:38] world record right now at for now that
[02:30:40] can be broken within a few a few seconds
[02:30:43] now right yeah but these guys are down
[02:30:45] so Boris just put out something there
[02:30:47] again and look at uh but he has now
[02:30:49] three mistakes Lance seems pretty
[02:30:51] confident there if we looking at his
[02:30:53] body language right and Forest he's
[02:30:55] thinking what am I going to spend those
[02:30:56] $2,000 on hopefully a STP to the barber
[02:31:01] shop maybe little he can take me with
[02:31:04] him I actually wanted to go to the
[02:31:05] barber shop as well but it couldn't you
[02:31:07] look fantastic do it anymore I I wanted
[02:31:09] to get a really bold head here today to
[02:31:11] make it really shiny but anyhow so 1
[02:31:14] minute to go Lance is already
[02:31:18] flying to the Moon there in his in his
[02:31:20] head Boris and uh clay it's not looking
[02:31:22] good for them no it's not there a
[02:31:24] valiant attempt but we have a world
[02:31:27] record
[02:31:28] so I really like B's time though with a
[02:31:31] 13. huh yeah
[02:31:36] um 40
[02:31:39] seconds
[02:31:41] actually well Boris doesn't really look
[02:31:44] like that he feels in any way confident
[02:31:46] about what he does there at the moment
[02:31:48] with still so many omissions that he has
[02:31:52] and I don't think there will be a huge
[02:31:54] outcry of disappointment because he
[02:31:56] already anticipates right now in this in
[02:31:58] this very moment that this is not really
[02:32:01] looking good for
[02:32:02] him there would only be there we go we
[02:32:05] have we have 20 seconds till we get a
[02:32:08] world record and I know Lance is going
[02:32:10] to be absolutely thrilled to have this
[02:32:12] he's trained this is not this used to
[02:32:15] not be his best
[02:32:17] uh discipline and here we go here we go
[02:32:20] two one and boom there he
[02:32:36] gets bis wins his match with 19 and thir
[02:32:41] 13 seconds Yan hendrik 30 and 53 seconds
[02:32:44] and Ben kidmore 30 and 56 seconds
[02:32:47] amazing scor and and you guys were like
[02:32:50] confidently walking um to the to the um
[02:32:54] ceremony of of of the Nations the day
[02:32:57] before and we were chewing all these
[02:32:58] guns and I thought these guys are
[02:33:00] so
[02:33:02] soic we are running late so like
[02:33:05] to another world oh by the way I'm not
[02:33:08] supposed to say American anymore since
[02:33:10] my wife is also American there are 35
[02:33:13] countries in on the American continent
[02:33:15] it's not just United States
[02:33:17] look at that let's look here so for the
[02:33:19] best cards of the day is Alex Mullen
[02:33:21] 16.86 seconds incredible images just now
[02:33:25] broken
[02:33:45] 13.91% with the words 53.65 everything
[02:33:48] was broken and
[02:33:49] anord except EX for for numbers but it
[02:33:52] was so close too so anudari she doesn't
[02:33:55] have any chance anymore to to go to day
[02:33:57] number two because Maro already out
[02:34:00] smarts her with a with a recoil accuracy
[02:34:03] the only look at look at him on camera
[02:34:04] do you see L the only the only chance
[02:34:07] for um for any surprise now will be
[02:34:10] Melanie
[02:34:11] winning her next match and Maru losing
[02:34:14] her his match next match that will
[02:34:16] switch both of their positions so mostly
[02:34:18] everyone's done for the all the others
[02:34:20] are just now fighting for their position
[02:34:22] here we will see what's happening
[02:34:23] between s if he wins he
[02:34:26] will be before Marvin and if Yan wins
[02:34:31] she will still be behind Everett except
[02:34:33] Everett is now completely screwing up
[02:34:35] his accuracy yeah we have the numbers
[02:34:37] now so now numbers will be exciting
[02:34:39] because uh Alex people will want that
[02:34:42] money and it's mostly people who are uh
[02:34:45] good at num numbers and have nothing to
[02:34:47] lose at this point marwin Simon
[02:34:51] Alex look at that yand trying to to
[02:34:54] build herself they need to beat it under
[02:34:56] 21 seconds to get 21. seconds and
[02:35:00] they'll beat it what is what is she
[02:35:02] putting on there instead of Tiara
[02:35:06] sheers it's a elastic
[02:35:14] band here we go
[02:35:18] still so sweaty we have numbers and then
[02:35:21] what was the last one
[02:35:23] names and Words which I don't think
[02:35:26] anybody's going to beat that one in
[02:35:27] terms of a record but numbers is
[02:35:30] definitely open you never know now can't
[02:35:36] predict look someone's asleep table four
[02:35:40] sh here no that's Everett sorry that's
[02:35:43] Everett yeah well I think Everett needs
[02:35:45] to win this to stay where he is not an
[02:35:48] accuracy if if yanaa wins this next game
[02:35:51] she will still be behind Everett at
[02:35:53] least there's nothing unless changing
[02:35:56] between the yeah no exactly she could
[02:35:59] easily switch with him yeah it's open
[02:36:03] but he still has Advantage there even if
[02:36:07] he loses there is still a good
[02:36:09] possibility that he's not losing his
[02:36:11] slot against
[02:36:13] Yan and also marn needs to win his just
[02:36:16] want to go down s s sandre by the way
[02:36:21] for everyone who's just listening to us
[02:36:23] that you see that stream you look at uh
[02:36:26] Shir and you look at aett but what we
[02:36:29] here in the studio we can we can look
[02:36:30] actually at three different cameras plus
[02:36:33] um our own cameras there have four
[02:36:35] cameras going on right now and we have
[02:36:39] all that material recorded don't we y so
[02:36:42] what what are we going to do with that
[02:36:44] later are we cutting cool video
[02:36:46] we'll make little shorts for the not
[02:36:49] like wearable shorts but uh short videos
[02:36:52] that we can uh upload for the world
[02:36:54] records and right do our best to keep
[02:36:57] making this sport exciting uh for next
[02:36:59] year for our future sponsors by the way
[02:37:02] speaking of variables will there be any
[02:37:04] um fan articles to to buy somewhere like
[02:37:06] our cool xmt t-shirts xmt baseball caps
[02:37:09] and the xmt um I don't know extension
[02:37:14] cord hold on that thought we have I'll
[02:37:18] answer that question after right now we
[02:37:19] have some sub2 second yeah we do s Simon
[02:37:23] at 1656 seconds and Alex at 17.65
[02:37:27] seconds
[02:37:29] and he would tie I mean he would tie it
[02:37:31] at 20.01 well it was oh no 21 also is an
[02:37:35] opportunity to win so we have another
[02:37:37] three potential and so Simon uses the
[02:37:41] two card I mean the two number method
[02:37:43] and
[02:37:44] then Marin uses three yes no Simon S no
[02:37:50] Simon has a four-digit system he does
[02:37:52] yeah he has 10,000 images in his in his
[02:37:55] memory system he's the only one so far
[02:37:57] memory does he show four at a time I
[02:37:59] think show he puts one he puts one image
[02:38:01] on one location with four digits so he
[02:38:05] has he has technically the most
[02:38:06] sophisticated one although of course
[02:38:09] that's um arguable whether this is
[02:38:12] better than a three-digit system or not
[02:38:14] because he has to
[02:38:16] deal with so many
[02:38:18] more or
[02:38:20] Alex uh either or I guess we'll go with
[02:38:23] Simon since he's got the faster fastest
[02:38:26] time here so what what is your opinion
[02:38:28] on that Nelson do you think that a
[02:38:30] three-digit system always beats a
[02:38:32] two-digit system and a four-digit system
[02:38:34] beats a three-digit system I used to see
[02:38:36] think between three and two no because
[02:38:38] then you think about Wang Fang and he
[02:38:40] uses two digits and he had the speed
[02:38:43] record for numbers but now it seems like
[02:38:46] the three is the way to go um but maybe
[02:38:49] just because people are thinking that
[02:38:51] and doing that more often look at Simon
[02:38:53] he's killing it right
[02:38:55] now we have a great shot of Lance
[02:38:58] chewing his gum just turning back let's
[02:39:02] switch to Alex here how's he
[02:39:05] doing okay he's he's pausing for a
[02:39:08] moment let's see if he's struggling to
[02:39:12] bring those to mind come on Alex and
[02:39:15] look at Simon 60 just needs 20 more I do
[02:39:18] know sometimes he does like to review it
[02:39:20] before he writes it down so I'm assuming
[02:39:22] those last few he remembered just by
[02:39:25] looking at it and now he's going back
[02:39:26] through his Memory Palace here he
[02:39:30] goes and Yan got her numbers perfectly
[02:39:34] unlike Everett who's still struggling to
[02:39:38] put to put it together there and he he
[02:39:41] he's actually missing a lot of digits at
[02:39:43] the moment meaning that that would
[02:39:46] actually screw up his accuracy probably
[02:39:48] to put him below Yan true if she's if
[02:39:50] she's
[02:39:52] winning um that's true yeah which puts
[02:39:56] him in in a difficult position because
[02:39:57] then he has to compete against a more
[02:40:00] higher ranking athlete from today there
[02:40:02] tomorrow
[02:40:03] y but he's got it there's two minutes
[02:40:06] left the moment yeah and so
[02:40:08] marwin was able to get his perfect so I
[02:40:11] think he secures his spot wow Alex just
[02:40:14] has the record oh here we go yep y here
[02:40:17] we go and Simon is how's Simon doing he
[02:40:20] did that so he corrected a mistake
[02:40:22] though just put in another mistake but
[02:40:24] hey he has still more than one and a
[02:40:25] half minutes to go so temporarily Alex
[02:40:29] has the world record maybe it only helps
[02:40:33] only is holding for another 90 seconds
[02:40:36] now just picture this if Alex were a
[02:40:37] single man right and there were eight
[02:40:39] ladies yeah giving him his phone number
[02:40:42] yeah he could do that in 17 seconds
[02:40:45] that's amazing if he was running out of
[02:40:48] the bar and parking ticket was running
[02:40:50] out and he needed to get those numbers
[02:40:51] he would just get them that should be a
[02:40:53] commercial for xmt memorizing eight
[02:40:55] different numbers yeah Ron did that in
[02:40:59] at the superum show by the way that was
[02:41:01] my idea I wrote I wrote that to these
[02:41:03] guys and they never they never contacted
[02:41:05] me again but they used it and thank you
[02:41:08] yeah was they they were happy that that
[02:41:10] I had this at you
[02:41:12] Simon how's he doing 50 seconds
[02:41:16] Let's uh how is he doing he's still he
[02:41:19] looks a bit befuddled trying to think of
[02:41:22] those last few digits but we're zoomed
[02:41:23] in on Alex I think we think that he's
[02:41:25] going to break
[02:41:26] it no now we're back at
[02:41:30] Simon it's will be very difficult for me
[02:41:33] he still have to put in three entire
[02:41:35] images there which are the 12 digits
[02:41:38] that they are still wrong or
[02:41:40] missing doesn't look good for him even
[02:41:43] if in the last seconds he comes up with
[02:41:44] it that's there he puts in another wrong
[02:41:46] one that's basically
[02:41:48] it now guessing something it's it's
[02:41:52] Alex's win what a day by Alex really
[02:41:56] Alex unbelievable had a few losses this
[02:41:58] morning but just pulled it together and
[02:42:00] just destroy the afternoon wow three two
[02:42:05] one Alex and here we go World memory
[02:42:08] record right here in new world record
[02:42:11] for for a guy who's just so incredibly
[02:42:14] xmt I mean this this man just practices
[02:42:18] for 30 minutes a day and after one and a
[02:42:22] half years becomes the world memory
[02:42:23] Champion it's insane that's the first
[02:42:25] time ever I heard something like that
[02:42:26] because before him everyone assumed I
[02:42:28] have to practice like 4 hours a day at
[02:42:30] least and some people practices the most
[02:42:32] exactly and that's Notre proved that
[02:42:34] that's actually not the case exactly you
[02:42:36] can you can do that you can do that um
[02:42:39] during during your breakfast probably do
[02:42:42] you see people lie about that at all
[02:42:44] probably
[02:42:47] I don't think Alex he's he's got school
[02:42:50] and and yeah true this is his it doesn't
[02:42:53] add up otherwise right exactly yeah
[02:42:56] that's
[02:42:57] amazing so there he is so now we have
[02:42:59] our last match of the day and this one
[02:43:02] will be probably one of the most
[02:43:04] interesting ones although it's on the on
[02:43:06] the bottom end this is really not all
[02:43:08] about melan versus Marlo even though
[02:43:11] they they not compete against each other
[02:43:14] so what's
[02:43:16] let's see and also also Katie versus
[02:43:19] purv can they catch each other let's go
[02:43:21] to the groups all right here we
[02:43:23] go uh they can't okay so P job so that's
[02:43:28] she can go for her maybe another world
[02:43:30] record but I mean she's got it in the
[02:43:31] back so I guess she has nothing to lose
[02:43:32] she's probably going to do something
[02:43:34] insane and congratulations to our
[02:43:35] youngest competitor ever a nine and six
[02:43:38] he's he's now he's now set on on day
[02:43:41] two and even before yaner who is still
[02:43:45] in the yellow here but that doesn't
[02:43:48] matter because she's why why is by the
[02:43:50] way why are Yan HRI andon yja not green
[02:43:55] although I still don't think it's green
[02:43:56] but why are they not already in in the
[02:43:59] next day because they they are but we
[02:44:01] know they are no one can no one can
[02:44:03] surpass them anymore it might only be
[02:44:05] the the green is for the top two seeds I
[02:44:08] wonder if um because this is still from
[02:44:12] the first year when we had 16
[02:44:13] competitors that maybe Simon didn't
[02:44:14] update that maybe that's maybe that's it
[02:44:18] you're right some of these y it's like
[02:44:20] it's like a yeah no it's a feature it's
[02:44:23] a feature Johannes and bevv could go for
[02:44:26] the top record this afternoon because
[02:44:28] they're both at 12 and 2 Lance is
[02:44:30] already at 13 and two but their recall
[02:44:33] yeah s that's that's true johannas could
[02:44:35] still surpass L there and pfia already
[02:44:38] has a better accuracy than lens uh yanas
[02:44:42] have to well I don't know if that's even
[02:44:44] possible with the 100% two 100% accurate
[02:44:47] things that he goes higher than that not
[02:44:50] quite sure but maybe herf has a slightly
[02:44:53] better chance to do that to get the top
[02:44:56] slot
[02:44:58] today fascinating I'm going to go join
[02:45:00] them in there and we'll wrap it up last
[02:45:02] one with this match we'll do the prizes
[02:45:05] for the top disciplines of the day and
[02:45:08] you guys can wrap it up and we'll see
[02:45:09] you tomorrow
[02:45:11] sure he's a good
[02:45:14] man Nelson D yeah yeah he was I mean he
[02:45:18] did so much for the sport even before
[02:45:20] even before he came up with the xmt he
[02:45:22] already put the USA on the map yeah and
[02:45:26] and I think it was an important thing
[02:45:27] for for memory Sports to put the USA on
[02:45:29] the map because this is one of the
[02:45:31] biggest countries in the world is the
[02:45:33] most did you see them on SNL it's it's
[02:45:36] the well I have a lot of words in my
[02:45:38] head that I don't want to that should be
[02:45:41] appropriate it's the well what do you
[02:45:44] call the USS it's like the the
[02:45:45] superpower right we are the superow yeah
[02:45:48] it's the superpower and the superpower
[02:45:49] should have some good memory athletes as
[02:45:51] well in order to to use that let's put
[02:45:54] Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in here
[02:45:57] let's see who wins that determines who's
[02:46:00] President
[02:46:03] right but but if we already going that
[02:46:07] far we should bring in a couple of these
[02:46:08] other candidates who dropped out earlier
[02:46:11] that's true um they might have a chance
[02:46:13] at this as well but let let's switch
[02:46:15] back from politics to games here but
[02:46:18] look at the top right what is there
[02:46:20] Florian top right of the screen oh yes
[02:46:24] interesting could could you say that
[02:46:25] because do you want me to say everyone
[02:46:28] who's listening and watching go to extr
[02:46:31] rememory challenge.com once again
[02:46:33] extremem memory challenge.com it's a 5
[02:46:36] to 10 minute test I guarantee it you
[02:46:38] will love it take the exam the challenge
[02:46:42] let's see how you do thank you and you
[02:46:44] will actually get some some feedback
[02:46:45] afterwards which will tell you how where
[02:46:49] you kind don't tell tell you exactly
[02:46:52] where you where you were but if you were
[02:46:54] in the upper or middle or lower end so
[02:46:57] you can at least get a feeling for
[02:46:58] yourself if you were in the lower end
[02:47:00] don't feel bad about yourself everyone
[02:47:01] can improve their memory memory
[02:47:03] techniques are out there there are so
[02:47:05] many websites there's memory sports.com
[02:47:07] there's the artof memory um. Forum there
[02:47:10] are many other websites there's the um I
[02:47:13] think the Mind athlete from from one
[02:47:15] white and and so on there's so many good
[02:47:18] websites where you can learn all of this
[02:47:21] mostly for free and if that's still not
[02:47:23] enough you can get one of those many
[02:47:24] memory coaches out there who will help
[02:47:27] you to get an incredible memory not just
[02:47:29] a average memory but a memory that is
[02:47:32] outsmarting everyone else and your
[02:47:34] friends and family look cool you look
[02:47:37] cool exactly you can go to a party and
[02:47:40] memorize a couple of cards and everyone
[02:47:41] will think you're a genius although
[02:47:43] you're not but you you are you can
[02:47:45] everyone can become a genius yeah well
[02:47:47] it depends when everyone is a genius and
[02:47:49] it's not really genius anymore well then
[02:47:51] we'll just move the bar up a little bit
[02:47:53] but at least you will feel very good
[02:47:54] about yourself and will give you an
[02:47:57] ability that was already lingering there
[02:48:00] in you all your life it was just dormant
[02:48:03] waiting for you to activate this power
[02:48:05] Florian how do you feel about this last
[02:48:07] event are you you tired or I'm I'm kind
[02:48:09] of happy that it's the last event
[02:48:11] because actually it's two more events
[02:48:13] isn't it no this the last one
[02:48:15] AR wait really yep all right well then
[02:48:19] oh one more after this this is yeah this
[02:48:22] is it this this is it all right so
[02:48:25] what's happening here at our live box
[02:48:27] everything dropped out oh it's our live
[02:48:29] box probably it's was tired before us
[02:48:33] just resetting there here we go we have
[02:48:35] marwin in back no that's Yan Hendrick in
[02:48:39] back right so still waiting something is

[02:48:47] wasn't here the past two years what do
[02:48:48] the guys do that lost the next two days

[02:49:28] creator of this won that four
[02:49:31] times no yeah us memory Championship
[02:49:34] yeah that's a different one the creator
[02:49:36] of that it's me and I didn't win
[02:49:38] anything here yet yeah
[02:49:41] so you were referring to the USA memory
[02:49:44] championship that's a different one are
[02:49:45] you created the US memory open yes wow I
[02:49:48] wanted to bring rankable championships

[02:49:54] German the German brought the first
[02:49:56] championship after so many years to to
[02:49:58] the United
[02:50:00] States right where are where's our feed
[02:50:03] here there still there we
[02:50:05] go something recall ends in
[02:50:08] 33 I mean 3 minutes and 30 seconds my my
[02:50:14] life view here is completely blank where
[02:50:16] do you get the stream for the I I don't
[02:50:17] think it's working right now because
[02:50:19] it's not showing the points oh no and
[02:50:21] it's starting soon recall ends I think
[02:50:23] there's something being messed up and
[02:50:24] then we'll reset the entire maybe we
[02:50:25] should sing a song or something or which
[02:50:28] one like the Smurf song the
[02:50:32] [Music]
[02:50:38] Smurf okay here we go everything is
[02:50:42] reseted people are
[02:50:45] getting ready now putting up
[02:50:48] their their smart
[02:50:50] glasses by the way Smart Glass really be
[02:50:53] aware of that as a cheating device these
[02:50:56] Google Glasses and stuff like that you
[02:50:57] can you can record stuff and then you
[02:50:59] see that in your glass and you don't
[02:51:00] even know maybe they're creating their
[02:51:03] own okay here we go they already started
[02:51:07] so let us let us have a closer look at
[02:51:10] table four with Maro and
[02:51:13] Johan or actually we already look we
[02:51:16] already look at that actually let's
[02:51:18] switch to Melanie because Melanie is now
[02:51:20] in the position to turn it around and
[02:51:23] throw M out of the competition yes so
[02:51:26] this is this is the table with K Pia
[02:51:29] where is Melanie I think we don't have
[02:51:32] any camera on Melanie yet Melanie is
[02:51:35] sitting at table two so please camera
[02:51:38] guys let us switch to
[02:51:41] table table two camera
[02:51:45] no no camera yet is there so I don't
[02:51:47] even know one of one of our camera guys
[02:51:49] has to decide to switch to table two and
[02:51:52] there is camera 2 now moving around and
[02:51:55] in a few seconds we will
[02:51:58] see the table with melon You're So Soft
[02:52:02] right now you sound like a golf anouncer
[02:52:05] and table two and here we are at the
[02:52:08] extreme memory tournament 2016 and now
[02:52:11] their memory goes and now I will bite
[02:52:13] into my cookie that I have here because
[02:52:14] I'm running out of
[02:52:16] energy do you want a chip do you need
[02:52:19] anything you want to no no I have I have
[02:52:20] my
[02:52:22] cookie there are 5 Seconds no whoa
[02:52:25] mine's
[02:52:27] off
[02:52:29] wow okay both of them have 60 seconds so
[02:52:32] that's interesting Melanie took a bit of
[02:52:35] time
[02:52:37] to um think about the remaining
[02:52:40] images a vessel already made some
[02:52:43] mistakes since since he is out I'm I'm
[02:52:47] pretty sure
[02:52:50] that she has a really good chance to to
[02:52:53] win that look he's already making so
[02:52:54] many red mistakes come on
[02:52:57] vessel finish this last one
[02:53:01] strong came all the way from the
[02:53:03] Netherlands the Netherlands it's my
[02:53:06] homeland oh no my computer crashed I
[02:53:08] cannot see at least it crashed on the
[02:53:10] last one can you can you click on
[02:53:11] Melanie please Yep looks it's crashing
[02:53:15] right
[02:53:16] now yours is crashing as well and the
[02:53:18] entire software is crashing now I hope
[02:53:21] it's not crashing for the athletes
[02:53:22] because that would
[02:53:23] be devastating I think if you're having
[02:53:27] the same issues that we have right now
[02:53:29] you will not see on the live website
[02:53:32] what they type in but on the live stream
[02:53:33] at least we can see what they type in
[02:53:35] there so that's good enough for us
[02:53:38] vessel has a million red words
[02:53:42] there but he's not not he's not
[02:53:44] improving he he did a similar thing that
[02:53:46] Katie and Simon did earlier now look at
[02:53:48] this vessel just did a couple of letters
[02:53:52] in there and he's now improving that
[02:53:55] into the correct words
[02:53:56] so Melanie hasn't won yet let's have a
[02:53:59] let's see Maro I I don't get Marlo's
[02:54:04] results yeah that's for some reason the
[02:54:07] website is it's not showing us that so
[02:54:10] let's let's just stay here look at stay
[02:54:12] here relax just enjoy it
[02:54:15] and and see how that goes Melanie has 30
[02:54:17] words she is still typing there1 by the
[02:54:21] way there's a slight delay of what she
[02:54:23] types in and what you see so don't
[02:54:24] wonder when she's not with her fingers
[02:54:26] on the keyboard how what happened to
[02:54:28] vessel it was just
[02:54:29] a yeah he moved everything I think to
[02:54:32] the side he might change that back in in
[02:54:35] a moment he got a minute and a half he's
[02:54:39] got a minute and a half but there we go
[02:54:40] he switched it
[02:54:41] yeah so he has 20 points Melanie is with
[02:54:45] 32 in the lead that looks very good for
[02:54:47] her but even if she wins she still needs
[02:54:51] Marlo to lose and right now we can't
[02:54:54] tell we we can't really tell we cannot
[02:54:56] click on on the result from from Maro
[02:54:59] and Johan there can we just go to Marlo
[02:55:01] the camera and then we'll just see his
[02:55:02] reaction and see if he's yeah I mean now
[02:55:04] the camera has to swing around
[02:55:06] completely so let's just stay there
[02:55:07] where we are let's just stay there we
[02:55:09] are and see what's what's happening at
[02:55:10] the end now now the camera is switching
[02:55:13] all right they are too fast for
[02:55:16] us Chris Christian and um and
[02:55:21] Johannes
[02:55:23] Su zo so so
[02:55:31] so we have 40 seconds left in day
[02:55:37] one okay I was I was able to reload the
[02:55:40] page and now I'm getting the feed um
[02:55:43] properly Maro is going to
[02:55:46] win it's it's inevitable he is being in
[02:55:51] the finals on day two and Melanie is
[02:55:53] dropping out although she did a
[02:55:55] fantastic job there and she really was

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FugF2CUbzXI

[00:00:01] tow you and collect the
[00:00:04] fee
[00:00:06] 6040 when you're in the back uh when
[00:00:09] you're finished with your match please
[00:00:12] remember to be quiet and
[00:00:14] seated it's so easy to get distracted as
[00:00:17] we all know by by someone just walking
[00:00:20] past the opening the the four
[00:00:23] competitors that are facing the back
[00:00:27] it's very easy if you're just walking by
[00:00:29] you think well I'm in the back back room
[00:00:31] I'm quiet my shoes aren't squeaking I'm
[00:00:33] just going to walk over here and grab
[00:00:35] something that can distract the for
[00:00:38] competitors that are facing that way so
[00:00:39] please take a seat whether you're in the
[00:00:41] back or in
[00:00:44] here like to have a wrong Applause for
[00:00:46] all the volunteers who are spending
[00:00:58] their
[00:01:23] split that up in two sections like we've
[00:01:26] done in the past two years for the past
[00:01:28] year um so what we'll do is is um
[00:01:31] everybody who's seated will stay here
[00:01:33] will take the other eight competitors
[00:01:35] into a back room I think we follow Mary
[00:01:37] and Beth are you going to or is just
[00:01:39] okay they'll be there to monitor you um
[00:01:43] what are we doing with phones phones no
[00:01:45] El should we put them in a basket or
[00:01:48] basket okay so no devices Mary will have
[00:01:51] a computer open once the surprise event
[00:01:54] is done um where you can see at least
[00:01:57] the scores of the matches that come
[00:01:59] afterwards can stay in the loop but we
[00:02:01] obviously don't want you to know what
[00:02:02] the surprise event is so no streaming
[00:02:07] um talking avoid talking about well they
[00:02:10] won't know people yeah um the point is
[00:02:14] is try to keep it as Fair as possible so
[00:02:16] the second group have no idea just like
[00:02:18] the first group will have no
[00:02:23] idea else so following that um then you
[00:02:28] know after the round of 16 is done we'll
[00:02:30] go into the
[00:02:31] quarterfinals and then we'll have lunch
[00:02:33] and then we'll go into the
[00:02:35] semifinals and then tomorrow will be the
[00:02:38] runner-up match starting uh at 9: and
[00:02:41] then we'll have the finals match and
[00:02:44] tomorrow just the heads up in the past
[00:02:47] the the surprise event for the runner-up
[00:02:49] match was the same as the one for the
[00:02:51] first Finals we're not doing that this
[00:02:53] year they'll be separate so we can just
[00:02:56] watch and um the third place match will
[00:02:59] just have
[00:03:09] and then how these matches work so every
[00:03:12] match is best of seven so first of Four
[00:03:15] Points um every match will start with
[00:03:18] one of these surprise events and we'll
[00:03:21] all do the same one in that round at the
[00:03:23] same time I'll announce it and the
[00:03:26] details will come and we'll do it and
[00:03:28] whoever wins that at their table
[00:03:30] um will get that first point from then
[00:03:33] on the loser of that match gets to
[00:03:36] choose of the five events what they want
[00:03:39] to do next so we'll go around the room
[00:03:42] asking who uh what they want to do and
[00:03:45] from now on it goes back and forth you
[00:03:47] can't choose any of the last two events
[00:03:49] that were done that's that's kind of the
[00:03:51] rule so let's say CC wins a surprise
[00:03:54] event Everett gets to choose the second
[00:03:56] point he says cars and then CC's turn
[00:04:00] she chooses names Everett's turn he
[00:04:03] can't choose cards or names he's got to
[00:04:04] choose one of the other three so you can
[00:04:06] choose your past two ones that
[00:04:12] clear
[00:04:15] um yeah in the in the event of a tie
[00:04:18] well we'll discuss for each surpris what
[00:04:20] the ties the tie issues are um some
[00:04:24] there may it will be very unlikely that
[00:04:26] there'll be a tie but in the event that
[00:04:28] there is a tie which we really don't
[00:04:30] think will happen we're just going to
[00:04:31] pull a card high card gets to go um I
[00:04:35] think that's the easiest way to choose
[00:04:37] the next I mean if you do it exactly the
[00:04:40] same time then I think it's you guys are
[00:04:43] equal so it's just we'll do by
[00:04:45] chance okay so we'll give that to
[00:04:50] Mary so the people that will be going
[00:04:53] with Mary um the next hour or so is Alex
[00:04:58] Mullen s
[00:05:00] PV Boris Johannes nja marwin and
[00:05:06] Christian so the eight of you if you
[00:05:08] guys could get in the back there and uh
[00:05:12] once you're within distance we'll we'll
[00:05:14] get started over
[00:05:23] here hey Mary will you maybe send me a
[00:05:26] text when you you're to go y

[00:06:28] big banner you here on the bottom there
[00:06:30] that's the extreme memory challenge we
[00:06:32] mentioned that yesterday once or twice
[00:06:34] this is what our sponsor. neuros signs
[00:06:37] put up it's the biggest memory test in
[00:06:40] the
[00:06:42] world check it out go there absolutely
[00:06:46] clear I want everybody to have a fair
[00:06:48] shot of this and understand what they
[00:06:50] have to do before they do it is that
[00:06:52] good so if there's any language issues
[00:06:56] make sure you tell us yeah so if if you
[00:06:58] don't understand me tell me and we'll
[00:07:00] figure it out okay once we start once
[00:07:04] the surprise is
[00:07:05] revealed it's hard to stop and go back
[00:07:11] and let me just wait for Mary to text me
[00:07:13] and let me know that everybody's in the
[00:07:16] back
[00:07:28] there
[00:07:50] sorry the
[00:07:51] doors good yeah can we get
[00:07:58] a
[00:08:09] okay so they're ready over there so we
[00:08:11] can start this
[00:08:17] um we all good back
[00:08:20] there okay
[00:08:23] so part of this
[00:08:26] um yeah so you guys can flip over the
[00:08:29] the sheets you have
[00:08:45] there it's the same thing you have in
[00:08:47] front of you so the basic these are the
[00:08:50] basic rules U I'll be revealing more
[00:08:52] rules past this sheet but I first want
[00:08:55] you to understand this first section
[00:08:56] before we continue so I will be EXP
[00:08:59] explaining this in three parts so this
[00:09:01] is a new kind of surprise event where
[00:09:03] your recall time will be timed so the
[00:09:06] max time allowed for this event will be
[00:09:09] 5 minutes you can stop your recall timer
[00:09:12] by clicking the Finish button before the
[00:09:14] five minutes are up if you choose so the
[00:09:16] recall will look similar to what you've
[00:09:19] been doing in all the events for recall
[00:09:22] the person who recalls the most items
[00:09:24] wins if both if both competitors recall
[00:09:27] the same number of items
[00:09:29] the person with the fastest recall time
[00:09:32] wins scoring is 1 point for correct no
[00:09:36] penalty for a mistake so very similar to
[00:09:38] what you're used to uh just we're timing
[00:09:40] the recall so does everyone understand
[00:09:43] that
[00:09:47] recall actually not quite those are
[00:09:51] really the the same rules for for
[00:09:54] everything else where I mean this is the
[00:09:56] recall time it's being tested yeah there
[00:09:58] is no
[00:10:00] memorization those are the same rules
[00:10:04] yeah well that's we we we'll get to that
[00:10:07] I just want to make sure everybody
[00:10:08] understands that part I'll give you more
[00:10:09] details that's we're not going to start
[00:10:11] don't worry um but it's recall time how
[00:10:15] fastly how quickly you
[00:10:21] recall not
[00:10:23] me okay so if everyone understands that
[00:10:26] I'd like you to please press the ready
[00:10:28] button
[00:10:29] we're not going to start don't worry
[00:10:30] I'll give you ample time to
[00:10:50] start well because someone might get two
[00:10:53] items two two items in five yes yeah
[00:10:59] score two items in five minutes is
[00:11:02] better than one item in one
[00:11:05] second does that make
[00:11:07] sense 10 items in five minutes is better
[00:11:16] than the recall time is the Tie break if
[00:11:18] you have the same score so if you both
[00:11:21] recall everything perfectly then the rec
[00:11:24] okay so the idea is not that we will
[00:11:27] have much later
[00:11:31] yeah I think it'll make more sense when
[00:11:33] I reveal
[00:11:34] what so someone memorizes if two people
[00:11:38] memorize recall 20 things and one
[00:11:41] recalls 20 things in one minute and one
[00:11:44] recalls 20 things in two minutes the
[00:11:47] person who call
[00:11:48] recalls faster
[00:11:51] wins do I see when the other person
[00:11:54] presses the Finish button or I don't see
[00:11:57] no yeah that was your question too yeah
[00:12:00] so the screen won't turn blue if the
[00:12:02] person finishes um it won't yeah and I
[00:12:07] believe you just have to press finished
[00:12:08] there is no right arrow or anything just
[00:12:11] click the finished button yeah is it uh
[00:12:15] are the recall and memorization time
[00:12:18] from the same block of time so you have
[00:12:20] to
[00:12:21] decide just wait one second you'll
[00:12:24] you'll understand that in a moment so
[00:12:26] justes everybody press ready that they
[00:12:28] understand at least what we've talked
[00:12:29] about
[00:12:38] now and
[00:12:47] no okay so this is the next part the
[00:12:49] next reveal So Yesterday everyone
[00:12:52] memorized cards images words names and
[00:12:55] numbers in several matches right you
[00:12:57] each had three matches of each of those
[00:12:59] five events correct your task will be to
[00:13:03] recall something you memorized yesterday
[00:13:05] it will be one of these five categories
[00:13:09] so something you memorized
[00:13:10] yesterday everybody might have something
[00:13:13] different
[00:13:15] right so no memorization it's only the
[00:13:18] recall
[00:13:20] right so you won't see the the
[00:13:22] information again what what does that
[00:13:24] mean so you tell me I don't know my
[00:13:26] match against Christian
[00:13:29] so hold on
[00:13:33] um so like I said you have three matches
[00:13:37] in each of those five events so let's
[00:13:39] call either you had the first match a
[00:13:42] middle match and a third match right so
[00:13:46] we will tell you it's one of those three
[00:13:49] I'm going to let you know which one that
[00:13:50] is in a moment okay please don't look at
[00:13:54] if you have your own computer please
[00:13:55] don't look at previous matches or
[00:13:58] previous Journeys or anything that you
[00:14:01] may have okay so the thing you will be
[00:14:03] asked to recall is your last match okay
[00:14:07] of one of those five
[00:14:09] disciplines so that'll be not
[00:14:12] necessarily your last match of the day
[00:14:15] just the last match in that discipline
[00:14:18] okay so you had cards your last cards
[00:14:22] match where you have numbers your last
[00:14:24] numbers match your words Last Words
[00:14:26] images last images and names last
[00:14:30] names that's okay so the way this is
[00:14:33] going to work I'm going to give you a
[00:14:34] 10-second countdown and then we are
[00:14:36] going to start so I know this is
[00:14:37] uncomfortable this is not how we do it
[00:14:39] but this is part of the recall it's
[00:14:40] figuring out how quickly you can access
[00:14:43] that information if you can and then
[00:14:45] filling it in as you go remember recall
[00:14:48] time is what we're
[00:14:55] timing
[00:14:57] exact
[00:14:59] if that's the event
[00:15:01] yeah so I'm going to say I'm not going
[00:15:04] to do this right now make sure you
[00:15:05] understand everything before we start
[00:15:07] but I'll say we have a 10-second
[00:15:08] countdown it will show up on their
[00:15:10] screen right we'll say go and then on
[00:15:12] their screen it'll be a 10-sec countdown
[00:15:14] and that is I'll say exactly what it is
[00:15:17] as we start that 10-sec countdown and
[00:15:19] obviously when it comes on the screen
[00:15:21] you know if it's names there'll be
[00:15:24] pictures you know yeah it's clear by the
[00:15:26] recall what you're recalling and
[00:15:29] everyone gets the same
[00:15:31] displine yes right but each person's
[00:15:35] final match of that discipline so your
[00:15:38] set might be different from Katie's
[00:15:40] because you played someone else or
[00:15:42] whatever um so all I need to say now is
[00:15:45] which of the five disciplines is right
[00:15:47] we all understand that it's the last one
[00:15:50] that you did of the day correct you
[00:15:53] understand
[00:15:56] understand you're not going to tell us
[00:15:58] what our last match was
[00:16:03] yeah Simone understand the
[00:16:06] rules
[00:16:07] HRI
[00:16:09] joh
[00:16:11] Kati okay so audience please take your
[00:16:13] seat so we're going to start so
[00:16:15] everybody's ready um as soon as I say
[00:16:18] we're starting 3 2 1 go there's going to
[00:16:21] be a 10-second countdown and then the
[00:16:23] recall will begin and I will announce
[00:16:25] what I'm going to announce what it is
[00:16:27] and then the 10 seconds will go
[00:16:29] so Silence from the audience please
[00:16:31] finish on the screen when you're done
[00:16:33] with your recall there's a finish button
[00:16:35] that's how you so you're you're only 20
[00:16:37] seconds or so away from starting so do
[00:16:39] whatever you need to do with headsets or
[00:16:41] earplugs or hats yeah because you only
[00:16:44] have 10 seconds before you start okay
[00:16:49] so so the event that you will be
[00:16:51] recalling the last one of this match of
[00:16:55] yesterday will
[00:16:56] be numbers
[00:17:00] quiet please don't talk to your
[00:17:01] competitor
[00:17:22] please kind of
[00:17:24] shout like
[00:17:26] hello hello welcome back we are back we
[00:17:30] were cut off a little bit there because
[00:17:31] there was an announcement earlier in the
[00:17:33] room for the first event of the day
[00:17:35] we're pretty surprised at the event
[00:17:37] ourselves so we're waiting on the
[00:17:39] information honestly we have no idea
[00:17:40] what's going on we we're just listening
[00:17:42] in the room and we heard something about
[00:17:45] fast recall which is awesome yes I
[00:17:47] already said to Max sadly Ben has
[00:17:49] already been eliminated because in my
[00:17:51] opinion he's like the fastest recall of
[00:17:53] all of them but you said you're the
[00:17:55] fastest of forgetting everything next
[00:17:58] why do why do you me no it's it's true I
[00:18:00] mean in memory we we want to reuse our
[00:18:04] memory palaces and after you recalled a
[00:18:07] deck of cards or numbers or whatever you
[00:18:09] don't need that information anymore so
[00:18:13] what you can do on purpose is you can
[00:18:15] you can tell yourself this information
[00:18:18] is relevant to me and for some reason as
[00:18:20] psychological effect that your brain
[00:18:21] then somehow understands that and
[00:18:25] handles this is it as it is irrelevant
[00:18:28] and then it fades it fades out a little
[00:18:31] bit quicker and also another thing that
[00:18:33] you can do is you just don't trigger the
[00:18:35] information anymore so you don't go back
[00:18:37] to your memory Palace you don't look at
[00:18:39] the table and ask yourself what was at
[00:18:41] the table um and then the information
[00:18:43] will not pop up and if it's not popping
[00:18:45] up it will not being strengthened so it
[00:18:48] looks like right now it's a numbers
[00:18:52] event yeah so our the Octo finals have
[00:18:56] already started what we see here is the
[00:18:59] first surprise event of the day um on
[00:19:03] the screen we see Marlo versus Lance and
[00:19:07] didn't really memorize anything did you
[00:19:08] see them memorize anything I think
[00:19:10] they're just supposed to recall what
[00:19:12] they did in that particular discipline
[00:19:15] in the
[00:19:16] last so this one this is this is numbers
[00:19:19] so they need to recall what they did
[00:19:21] yesterday in the last way too extreme
[00:19:24] this is too extreme how extreme how
[00:19:26] could someone do this and such a
[00:19:27] surprise yeah right so it's it's
[00:19:30] difficult I think it's super difficult
[00:19:31] to remember that and it's also a little
[00:19:33] bit I must say it's a tiny bit mean
[00:19:36] because it is mean thanks Nelson maybe
[00:19:39] maybe these guys didn't really properly
[00:19:40] memorize this last discipline yesterday
[00:19:43] but look at look at Katie look at yri
[00:19:46] not sure if they remember some people
[00:19:48] will remember a lot let's look at Katie
[00:19:49] a table four right now she has 58 and
[00:19:53] she's got a lot of green on her
[00:19:55] screen and same with Johannes at 50 1 y
[00:19:59] Yan Henrik is really rocking it right
[00:20:00] now with 64 yeah and Marlo as well 47
[00:20:04] Old Man River he's he's 48 years old
[00:20:07] he's almost at the same score right so
[00:20:10] Everett and CeCe are struggling right
[00:20:12] now but we'll see there's 2 minutes and
[00:20:14] 25 seconds left in recall let's let's
[00:20:16] analyze what is actually going on in
[00:20:17] their minds right now yeah so in memory
[00:20:20] Sports we have our memory systems so we
[00:20:22] are doing numbers right now all of these
[00:20:24] athletes they have two three four
[00:20:27] digigit uh images encoding encoding
[00:20:30] these numbers into images and then then
[00:20:32] put these images on the Memory Palace so
[00:20:34] far so good and then they have a lot of
[00:20:38] memory palaces hundreds thousands of
[00:20:41] so-called loai which is Latin for
[00:20:44] location yep right it took ladin for
[00:20:46] seven years very good do you remember a
[00:20:49] lot of it no my recall is pretty bad you
[00:20:51] need some memory training anyhow
[00:20:55] um the surprise event now is as asking
[00:20:58] them if we understood that correctly
[00:21:00] because we just understood half of it
[00:21:03] actually they need to recall what they
[00:21:05] did yesterday in each of the five
[00:21:08] disciplines in this particular one right
[00:21:10] now um the numbers discipline so they
[00:21:13] have to go back to that Memory Palace
[00:21:15] that they used in the last event so
[00:21:17] first of all that's actually already it
[00:21:20] can be tricky because they did so many
[00:21:22] matches yesterday first of all they need
[00:21:24] to remember which memory pet they used
[00:21:26] there otherwise they have all this
[00:21:27] information from yesterday then they go
[00:21:30] there and then they need to remember
[00:21:31] these images but they as you have seen
[00:21:33] yesterday they did so many events 15 per
[00:21:36] person hundreds of images Marlo right it
[00:21:41] looks pretty good no no mistake so far
[00:21:43] there Lance is a little off and since
[00:21:46] they had so many images it's easy to
[00:21:48] confuse all of that yeah so now they're
[00:21:51] really trying to get in there now there
[00:21:53] 25 seconds left CC CC only got two yeah
[00:21:56] so she is is really struggling the ever
[00:22:00] only got 12 L only got 12 uh you see
[00:22:03] that's like everything is red there uh
[00:22:06] it's really that's really a tough one I
[00:22:09] think I think that it's just the first
[00:22:13] round of the first round yeah surpris is
[00:22:17] much more than just this what we just
[00:22:19] see here yeah it's best out of seven
[00:22:20] they need to win four no no wait but
[00:22:21] what I'm referring to is this is not
[00:22:23] just the surprise event yet I think this
[00:22:25] just part of the surprise event yeah so
[00:22:27] I as far as I understood that they have
[00:22:29] to do all the four other events the all
[00:22:33] the four other disciplines as well now
[00:22:35] well looks like I remember from
[00:22:37] yesterday looks like Yan Hendrick got
[00:22:38] the best score it's 64 and Johannes and
[00:22:41] ktie are on par with 58 that's but it
[00:22:45] looks like johannas beat Katie with her
[00:22:47] recall um with his recall of
[00:22:50] 27217 the recall speed was relevant
[00:22:53] there so oh my God this is really and
[00:22:56] look at Everett Everett beat uh um CC
[00:22:59] 300 but he got 14
[00:23:03] 14 wow that's that's impressive to get
[00:23:07] any like just remember anything from
[00:23:11] yesterday right I mean I thought Marlo
[00:23:14] was incredible techn technically
[00:23:16] technically it's not that crazy if you
[00:23:20] just memorize a little bit for the
[00:23:21] regular person right now it's pretty
[00:23:24] crazy for the regular person everything
[00:23:26] we do here is crazy but then again let
[00:23:28] us mention everyone can do that everyone
[00:23:30] can learn that you can get an incredible
[00:23:32] memory out there as well if you haven't
[00:23:34] done that before and you can learn by
[00:23:36] going to extremem memory challenge.com
[00:23:38] actually can memory the extreme memory
[00:23:42] challeng stud is is just giving you an
[00:23:44] indication of where you are right now
[00:23:46] and then you can learn afterwards so the
[00:23:50] extreme memory challenge is the biggest
[00:23:53] memory test in the world but it will not
[00:23:55] really help you to improve your memory
[00:23:56] it just gives you an indic where you are
[00:23:58] I just want to talk about Everett right
[00:24:00] now he won his first event first
[00:24:01] surprise event and I just learned that
[00:24:04] he's
[00:24:05] homeschooled is he you know you know
[00:24:07] this is a really wonderful thing I love
[00:24:09] about the United States that you have
[00:24:11] this that you have this possibility in
[00:24:12] Germany for example it's against the law
[00:24:15] really it's completely impossible to do
[00:24:17] that the the government takes control of
[00:24:20] your education and although I'm not I I
[00:24:24] don't want to educate that or advertise
[00:24:26] that every everyone is doing
[00:24:28] homeschooling but I think the
[00:24:29] possibility is a pretty nice one
[00:24:32] especially with technology now exactly
[00:24:33] everything can come home with you
[00:24:35] exactly right now we're on we're on the
[00:24:38] images event we still have CC Everett
[00:24:42] and then we have a table two Lance vers
[00:24:44] Marlo Knight Table Three Simon vers Yan
[00:24:47] hendrik and table four Yanna zooo vers
[00:24:50] Katie so is this now already over
[00:24:54] surprise event this is over for now so
[00:24:56] that they only had to do numbers not the
[00:24:58] other yeah disciplines all right they
[00:25:00] might come back to another surprise
[00:25:01] event yeah there will be more surprise
[00:25:03] events during the day y many more and
[00:25:07] I'm sure they will get harder every time
[00:25:09] although actually this was already
[00:25:10] pretty pretty tough but all the surprise
[00:25:12] events are always like oh my God what do
[00:25:14] you do there because you're not prepared
[00:25:16] for this now on my screen it says we're
[00:25:19] doing images but uh yep okay perfect
[00:25:21] we're there well if the surprise event
[00:25:23] is not really over and this is it then
[00:25:25] that means that the the winners who are
[00:25:28] Everett Marlo Yan Henrik and Johannes
[00:25:32] they can now choose the event of their
[00:25:35] choice Yep this is why we will now see
[00:25:38] all these different events for the for
[00:25:40] our athletes so um CC and aeverett are
[00:25:43] doing images obviously since was
[00:25:46] Everett's choice he's very confident
[00:25:48] about this event and he will try for a
[00:25:50] very fast time um Lance and Marlo are
[00:25:54] doing
[00:25:55] words Simon and Jan h are doing cards by
[00:25:58] the way Yan Henrik beating Simon that's
[00:26:01] that's also interesting interesting
[00:26:03] thing the Simon's pretty good first the
[00:26:06] first xmt winner and Yan hendrik tries
[00:26:09] to challenge him in his specialty but on
[00:26:11] the other hand Simon doesn't really have
[00:26:14] a specialty he's good at everything but
[00:26:16] is Jan Hender kind of poking at him
[00:26:18] because he just picked cards cuz y Sim's
[00:26:20] pretty damn good at cards he probably he
[00:26:22] probably thinks that names and words are
[00:26:25] something that Simon will outsmart him
[00:26:28] more easily than cards although he was
[00:26:30] the cards world record holder up until
[00:26:33] Alex took it away from him recently Alex
[00:26:34] really took it away with
[00:26:37] [Music]
[00:26:56] 16.83% we see Simon and Yan hendrik here
[00:27:00] Simon was take was taking it kind of
[00:27:03] safe with 38 seconds and Yan hendrik
[00:27:07] took the entire time I think it was a
[00:27:09] strategy sa yeah it was a strategy from
[00:27:11] the beginning I guess if he was smart
[00:27:13] there um and I'm sure he was uh he was
[00:27:17] just hoping that Simon would do too much
[00:27:20] or just counting on a mistake there it's
[00:27:24] unlikely though this time that Simon did
[00:27:26] there this is a very very safe easy time
[00:27:29] for him it must have felt like Sleep
[00:27:31] Walk sleep walking through the room like
[00:27:33] while he memorizing in cards he can do
[00:27:36] twice as fast and going back to table
[00:27:39] one it looks like they both are doing
[00:27:40] very well in images there are no red
[00:27:43] it's all green but CCE did in 43.5
[00:27:46] seconds so she has an advantage there
[00:27:49] and we have Louis Angel here come on
[00:27:50] Louis do you want to join us for a quick
[00:27:52] minute right you have just a quick
[00:27:55] minute you were in the room and the
[00:27:56] surprise even we I was in there can you
[00:27:58] just give us a quick um um yeah overview
[00:28:01] because we didn't hear everything okay
[00:28:03] so first of all everybody was totally
[00:28:05] surprised and shocked that this was
[00:28:07] happening uh because we've never had
[00:28:09] that before where you take information
[00:28:11] and we were just talking about it
[00:28:12] yesterday right can these memory
[00:28:14] athletes remember information you know a
[00:28:16] day later two days later a week later
[00:28:18] and we just saw the results of that some
[00:28:21] some of them can really do well with
[00:28:23] that with long-term memory recall and
[00:28:26] some you know they just either forget it
[00:28:28] because they don't care about the
[00:28:29] information anymore um or you know they
[00:28:32] just have a harder time to recall it to
[00:28:34] r that information this is very
[00:28:36] important that shows like if you can
[00:28:38] really remember things exactly are we
[00:28:40] true memory ex but but on the other hand
[00:28:43] um the result that we saw here must be
[00:28:45] taken carefully and um you cannot just
[00:28:48] say because of this result we canot
[00:28:51] exactly say this and that because what
[00:28:53] they did yesterday all of them had 15
[00:28:55] events they had they memorized hundreds
[00:28:57] maybe thousands of information depending
[00:28:59] on their systems if it was just say
[00:29:02] here's a 80 digigit number that's all
[00:29:04] you're going to do today tomorrow we're
[00:29:06] going to test you on it the results
[00:29:08] would have been much different
[00:29:09] completely different that's that's
[00:29:10] completely you didn't want to do that
[00:29:13] that's why it's that probably didn't
[00:29:14] even remember what Journey they used
[00:29:16] that what memory palets they used for
[00:29:17] the last event because they used so many
[00:29:20] or how did Lance react to this uh I
[00:29:22] think he was one of the most shocked
[00:29:24] individuals in the room cuz he's like
[00:29:26] wait what's going on but he was actually
[00:29:28] he got I don't know if you guys saw like
[00:29:29] his ticker but he got most of them
[00:29:32] correct the ones that he put down it was
[00:29:34] just he was missing a two so that
[00:29:35] shifted everything over to the left if
[00:29:37] he would have put in a two everything
[00:29:39] would have been shifted to the right and
[00:29:40] he would have got in most of those
[00:29:41] correct and I think he would have beat
[00:29:43] Marlo but Marlo did an amazing job with
[00:29:45] over 60 digits I think it was uh correct
[00:29:48] so uh he was he has a really what
[00:29:50] happened right here was that right so uh
[00:29:52] what are we looking here on the live on
[00:29:54] the live stream Lance left the table hm
[00:29:57] something happened there I'm not sure if
[00:30:00] that was a technical problem or if Lance
[00:30:02] I did hear last year Lance you know when
[00:30:05] he doesn't want to do something he just
[00:30:06] leaves well maybe he was maybe it was a
[00:30:09] um so shocking for him what happened
[00:30:11] with the surprise event that now he has
[00:30:12] to gather his his energy again and maybe
[00:30:16] he left the room to take a deep breath
[00:30:18] and cuz you can lose another one best
[00:30:20] out of seven did he win the first one no
[00:30:22] I think he lost I mean the second one I
[00:30:24] think he lost against Mal well the
[00:30:25] second one now
[00:30:28] really over yet and this is as it looks
[00:30:31] like Marlo has 10 lands this is the
[00:30:33] second one is this still the surprise
[00:30:35] event now no this is already we we're
[00:30:38] moving on yeah they get to pick their
[00:30:39] own event there's 5 seconds left in the
[00:30:41] recall it looks like CC's taking home
[00:30:44] this event in images 28 to 26 although
[00:30:48] it was Everett's pick so that's also
[00:30:50] interesting we should always have uh
[00:30:52] take into consideration who picked the
[00:30:54] event and what will they actually take
[00:30:56] out of it yeah because they all have
[00:30:58] this strategy now now the advantage goes
[00:31:00] to CC because now she's going to choose
[00:31:01] the next one and if we look at this I
[00:31:03] mean Simon against Yan Henrik Yan Henri
[00:31:05] picked cards but he's now Lo he now lost
[00:31:07] against Simon same for cc versus Everett
[00:31:11] Everett picked images but he now lost
[00:31:13] against Cece and then Katie Katie versus
[00:31:16] johannas who was this is her specialty
[00:31:19] wi her second round she W she won the
[00:31:21] second so she won one and two and three
[00:31:24] right or it's one and one it so johannas
[00:31:26] was winning the surprise event and he
[00:31:28] picked he picked the um event I just did
[00:31:32] and he he lost it against Katy so three
[00:31:34] out of four already lost their first
[00:31:36] their first pick of this here's Lance
[00:31:38] again interesting let's see what
[00:31:39] happened he has some cards I don't know
[00:31:41] why he cards let's see
[00:31:43] he's yeah we cannot hear the audio the
[00:31:46] um live stream I think that's good we
[00:31:48] live Spectators they can hear what he is
[00:31:50] saying probably I think he's saying I
[00:31:53] love extreme memory tourn and take the
[00:31:56] extreme memory about to drop down to
[00:31:59] extrem challenge.com exactly all right
[00:32:02] uh cool thank you guys for having me
[00:32:04] sure all the time give give us some
[00:32:05] information let's hear tell us like
[00:32:07] what's happening in there always come
[00:32:09] back okay yeah yeah I will I'll feed you
[00:32:11] guys some good especially about the
[00:32:12] surprise events because we weren't
[00:32:13] provided with any information him okay I
[00:32:16] wasn't either so I saw I was surprised
[00:32:18] just as these guys and GS and but can
[00:32:20] you can you tell Nelson please to um
[00:32:23] inform us for the next surprise event
[00:32:25] because otherwise is we can't they can't
[00:32:28] say anything they don't have to tell us
[00:32:29] beforehand but at least give us a piece
[00:32:31] of paper when they are announcing it
[00:32:33] yeah so then we can actually tell people
[00:32:35] everyone got got a paper with
[00:32:36] information I guess maybe not for this
[00:32:39] one but for the other well now we're on
[00:32:40] to last two years we did that okay yeah
[00:32:43] another round and CCE and Everett are
[00:32:46] choosing cards Lance and Marlo at table
[00:32:48] two are choosing cards at table three
[00:32:50] it's Simon and Yan Hendrick choosing
[00:32:52] names and a table for Johannes and Katie
[00:32:55] and that's cards three cards of events
[00:32:57] in one name so the The Pick of the
[00:32:59] disciplines are now going back and forth
[00:33:01] back and forth the winner of the
[00:33:03] surprise event had the first pick that
[00:33:05] was what we just saw in the second round
[00:33:07] and now in the third round we will
[00:33:09] actually um all these picks are from the
[00:33:12] loser of the surprise events and this
[00:33:14] will now go back and forth for all um
[00:33:17] seven seven rounds that we have in the
[00:33:20] Octo finals now I want to look at table
[00:33:21] two let's stay on this one at Lance and
[00:33:23] Marlo because this is big for Lance he
[00:33:25] needs to win this event right he's
[00:33:27] already down
[00:33:28] 2 so exactly and he was he was the one
[00:33:32] who was going really crazy yesterday who
[00:33:34] had uh the highest results of the entire
[00:33:37] of the entire xmt team and here we go
[00:33:40] memorization starts in 25 seconds at the
[00:33:42] moment Lance is the clear favorite at
[00:33:45] least that's how he started into the day
[00:33:47] right now he is can we zoom in is he
[00:33:50] wearing his slippers
[00:33:51] today maybe that could help actually we
[00:33:54] can see that he's only wearing socks uh
[00:33:56] we didn't see see that live we were
[00:33:58] seeing that in our we were see our
[00:34:00] stream here they're doing their
[00:34:02] memorization ready in three 2 and one
[00:34:06] okay here we go both of them using a
[00:34:08] double card system and Lance is just
[00:34:10] rushing through these cards Maro is
[00:34:12] taking it way slower which is fine it
[00:34:14] might give him an advantage if he counts
[00:34:17] on Lance making a mistake there Lance
[00:34:21] seems to he's already finished there in
[00:34:23] the original video stream we can see
[00:34:26] that there um on our on our website it's
[00:34:29] still lagging 2 3.41 seconds by Lance so
[00:34:33] for everyone who's wondering why he was
[00:34:34] already finished there we have a 10c
[00:34:37] delay on the website on purpose so that
[00:34:41] nobody in the room can and he are the
[00:34:43] zoom yes thank you thank you very much
[00:34:45] thank you it looks like he's just
[00:34:47] wearing socks today yeah but that looks
[00:34:49] comtable he's very comfortable outfit
[00:34:51] but he hasn't picked up on yonas from
[00:34:52] Essence style yet who's wearing two
[00:34:55] colored uh um wrangled socks two
[00:35:00] different socks he's not doing that well
[00:35:02] he's he's covered in hair so he's
[00:35:04] probably pretty warm too but actually
[00:35:05] it's interesting because I have seen a
[00:35:07] couple of really good memory athletes
[00:35:09] now who are taking off their shoes for
[00:35:11] the events now Clemens climens um Maya
[00:35:14] did that who was the world memory
[00:35:15] Champion 2005 2006 and yonas Van Essen
[00:35:18] did that who was a two times World
[00:35:19] memory champion in strategy what was it
[00:35:24] 201 13 14
[00:35:27] I think your memory yonas Essen from
[00:35:30] Sweden all right here we go and we've
[00:35:33] she's not using a newspaper today just a
[00:35:36] paper and Everett CH the youngest
[00:35:40] competitor 15 years old just turned 15
[00:35:43] two days ago he just he just told me
[00:35:44] that he will come to our live stream as
[00:35:46] soon as he's being eliminated and I told
[00:35:48] him um so you will not come at all then
[00:35:52] no right he has really good chances to
[00:35:56] he does look at the to come forward with
[00:35:58] this he did 34.6 seconds he's incredibly
[00:36:01] talented and if he's a little bit in
[00:36:04] luck in terms of what his the other
[00:36:06] opponents do in this um in this in these
[00:36:09] events today he might actually even get
[00:36:12] into the finals tomorrow yeah it will be
[00:36:14] tough but it's possible and it will be a
[00:36:16] sensation for sure so what are we doing
[00:36:20] here now we are looking at Simon and Yan
[00:36:23] hendri Germany against Germany they are
[00:36:27] doing names o look at table two keep
[00:36:30] switching back and
[00:36:32] forth between Lance and
[00:36:36] Marlo but Lance did in 23.4 one seconds
[00:36:39] absolutely incredible yeah Lance already
[00:36:42] put in a mistake there but he still has
[00:36:45] two and a half minutes to correct it but
[00:36:49] Marlo Marlo's looking green for now but
[00:36:52] that doesn't mean anything and I love
[00:36:54] this Marlo is on fire if we could get
[00:36:56] the the finals Marlo versus Everett
[00:36:59] that'd be my favorite final yeah and
[00:37:01] also I mean what we saw yesterday Marlo
[00:37:04] was the last one to qualify for the
[00:37:06] finals it was pretty it was pretty
[00:37:08] intense between anudari Marlo and
[00:37:11] Melanie and re Maro really did it and it
[00:37:15] was very important for him because last
[00:37:16] year he was he just dropped out as the
[00:37:20] last person to qualify for the finals
[00:37:22] and now he just got in to the finals at
[00:37:26] last and he just finished moment he just
[00:37:28] finished perfect score 60 seconds not a
[00:37:31] great time but it's a secure Time same
[00:37:33] with CC 50 60 seconds as well exactly
[00:37:36] Everett still has a minute and 30
[00:37:38] seconds to go look Simon and Yan Henrik
[00:37:40] they have both 60 seconds and Simon has
[00:37:43] 25 names Yan Henrik has 24 names so oo
[00:37:47] that that could actually get uh oh um
[00:37:50] although Simon had a little misspelling
[00:37:52] that he might correct forever just won
[00:37:55] that round Everett table one
[00:37:58] 34.6 seconds he wins again fantastic he
[00:38:02] is on fire there but not the the event's
[00:38:04] not over yet he might build in actually
[00:38:06] a mistake out of um I some rational
[00:38:10] analyzing that puts him on a wrong track
[00:38:12] it wouldn't be the first time that
[00:38:14] happens so Yan hendrik just just went
[00:38:18] even with Simon typing in lazyy
[00:38:23] everywhere and I think he hit did he hit
[00:38:25] the right lazy I think he did so he got
[00:38:28] this one point that was necessary for
[00:38:29] him maybe Simon finds this one Ellison
[00:38:33] name there and corrects that for
[00:38:35] whatever reason Allison here is spelled
[00:38:37] with Three L's without an ey is that
[00:38:39] correct you see that same thing here so
[00:38:42] oh he could he got it he really found
[00:38:45] thats Triple L
[00:38:47] Ellison um Simon got the 26 now Simon
[00:38:50] told me his Memory Palace is very he Rec
[00:38:53] corrected it he Rec corrected he just
[00:38:55] got it right did you see that
[00:38:57] he he made it Triple L Alison oh wait no
[00:38:59] but Yan Hendrick went back
[00:39:01] down no what is going on there both of
[00:39:04] them lost the point Yan Henrik was even
[00:39:07] then Simon got above and then Simon got
[00:39:09] down again and Yan Henrik also got this
[00:39:11] is exactly what I said people are
[00:39:14] starting to rationalize their decisions
[00:39:16] and instead of listening to their
[00:39:18] intuition they built in a mistake which
[00:39:22] is a really interesting thing in memory
[00:39:24] because you should always listen to your
[00:39:25] intuition in gives you clue then you
[00:39:28] start rationalizing and then you don't
[00:39:30] remember actually what you remembered
[00:39:32] and then you make mistakes very lucky
[00:39:35] Simon's a lucky man that he won that
[00:39:36] round Simon was extremely lucky and Yan
[00:39:39] Henrik was extremely unlucky because he
[00:39:41] was there and that was oh my God that
[00:39:44] didn't really cost uh that did cost him
[00:39:47] a valuable Point here now with Simon I
[00:39:51] was just saying that his Memory Palace
[00:39:52] is very tamed he that's what he says
[00:39:55] it's not like the other ones where they
[00:39:56] use violence and sexual images right he
[00:40:00] says it's more just you know physical
[00:40:02] things like building stuff which I
[00:40:05] thought was very
[00:40:06] interesting names numbers or words
[00:40:17] numbers
[00:40:21] numbers you're having actually the X
[00:40:23] andt tsht I don't need the look at
[00:40:24] t-shir today look can't help me now I'm
[00:40:26] already out of the competition you're
[00:40:28] just enjoying it now right it's so much
[00:40:30] easier right we just going crazy here
[00:40:32] with all these with all this what's
[00:40:33] happening um Simon against Yan Henrik
[00:40:36] they just had 25 against last second
[00:40:39] both both of them changed something um
[00:40:42] Simon had an Ellison with triple L and
[00:40:45] he found out that it was Triple L and he
[00:40:47] corrected it down again y Henrik had 25
[00:40:49] and he corrected it down to 24 so it's
[00:40:52] so interesting in memory Sports you have
[00:40:55] only we can see that that they already
[00:40:56] right they have all these points and
[00:40:58] then all of a sudden they start
[00:40:59] rationalizing and I just sent that to
[00:41:01] Max um I see that from my own training
[00:41:03] when I follow my instinct it's in most
[00:41:06] cases right but then when I think about
[00:41:08] it it doesn't feel like it's right I
[00:41:09] don't remember this image it just came
[00:41:12] out of the blue and then I start
[00:41:14] rationalizing it and I think about it
[00:41:15] and I think a little bit more about it
[00:41:16] and I I I delete it again or I don't
[00:41:19] trust myself and I put in something else
[00:41:21] and that's wrong oh the great thing
[00:41:23] about watching these events is you can
[00:41:24] see how the competitors minds are
[00:41:26] working at it I remember last year or
[00:41:28] maybe the year before seon in a numbers
[00:41:30] event he typed in a huge string of
[00:41:32] numbers he stopped he realized he have
[00:41:34] only got 14 images there should be 15 he
[00:41:37] thinks wait where is the gap what is the
[00:41:39] other image you can see it all playing
[00:41:41] out in his mind as he's sitting the last
[00:41:43] 30 seconds I can see that I can never
[00:41:45] quite understand what's going on in
[00:41:46] Lan's
[00:41:47] mind he's always the same now with your
[00:41:51] preparation has it changed over the
[00:41:53] years are you yeah yeah I mean when I
[00:41:57] started back in the year 2000 there was
[00:41:59] really only the world memory
[00:42:00] Championship so I spent most of my time
[00:42:02] preparing the long events the marathan
[00:42:04] events as we call them one hour numbers
[00:42:06] one hour cards things like the xmt they
[00:42:09] didn't come along until a lot later on I
[00:42:11] did a little bit of practice of speed
[00:42:12] cards in the old days but I only focused
[00:42:14] on the long events the long disciplines
[00:42:16] now I think there's a lot more focus on
[00:42:18] the quick short things that remembering
[00:42:20] something very very fast no is it
[00:42:23] exhausting over time it's yeah it's
[00:42:25] really physically shattering after a
[00:42:27] competition like this I mean I haven't
[00:42:29] done so much this year on account of
[00:42:30] being knocked early but if I'd gone a
[00:42:32] way to the final I would have to like
[00:42:34] spend the next day asleep absolutely it
[00:42:37] wears me out physically and it does the
[00:42:39] same I think for everybody else yeah
[00:42:41] absolutely it's it's like like real hard
[00:42:44] work a championship it especially if you
[00:42:47] have several days like the world memory
[00:42:48] championships three days with Marathon
[00:42:51] disciplines where you sit there for 3
[00:42:52] hours just for one discipline but even
[00:42:55] this over 3 days it's so intense you're
[00:42:57] only sitting there memorizing for a
[00:42:58] minute maximum but it's so draining it
[00:43:01] now do you think it's a competitive
[00:43:03] Advantage for someone like everu who's
[00:43:05] 15 years
[00:43:07] old it's scary he wasn't even born when
[00:43:09] I first started doing this that is
[00:43:12] incredible that's a really good question
[00:43:13] because we had this discussion before
[00:43:16] yesterday and then vessel came in and he
[00:43:19] he said oh no I think the Young The
[00:43:21] Young Ones will always be superior to
[00:43:23] the older ones and I completely disagree
[00:43:25] I don't think that's true at all I think
[00:43:26] I think if any in any age if you do the
[00:43:30] right training and the right dedication
[00:43:33] you can you can outsmart all these
[00:43:35] youngsters with ease yeah and I mean for
[00:43:38] example when when we look at you you had
[00:43:40] you had your Peak a couple of years ago
[00:43:42] and then you had all these World Records
[00:43:44] numbers cards and so on and then for a
[00:43:46] while you were holding that I was Top of
[00:43:47] the World in my early 30s so you know
[00:43:49] there's still hope if you're that kind
[00:43:50] of right and and Caston won the World
[00:43:53] Championship when he was late 40s
[00:43:55] exactly he's a per example that he was
[00:43:57] super dedicated he always had this goal
[00:43:59] to become this world memory champion and
[00:44:01] he was eight times German Champion when
[00:44:03] he finally reached that moment and
[00:44:06] afterwards he immediately dropped out of
[00:44:08] memory spots he reached his goal he
[00:44:10] didn't want to go further anymore well I
[00:44:11] feel like you're going to come back well
[00:44:13] I feel like you're motivated now I hope
[00:44:15] so yeah but it's it's hard to come back
[00:44:17] like floran said gun stopped competing
[00:44:19] after we achieved his go won the world
[00:44:20] champion I myself the first time I won
[00:44:22] the World Championship I couldn't sit
[00:44:23] down and look at a pack of cards for
[00:44:25] another year after that I just couldn't
[00:44:27] find the motivation to sit down and
[00:44:28] practice I got it back and then it
[00:44:30] slumped off again yeah and then you got
[00:44:32] it back again well I was saying to
[00:44:34] somebody this morning the last time I
[00:44:35] was seriously practically training was
[00:44:38] 2008 I've done bits and pieces since
[00:44:40] then but I'm basically coting on all the
[00:44:42] hard work I did all those years ago but
[00:44:45] it's also it's also impressive that um
[00:44:47] that it shows how you can keep up a
[00:44:50] level that you achieved once with little
[00:44:52] training little to none training um and
[00:44:56] it will not fade away like when you're
[00:44:58] doing weightlifting for example you
[00:45:00] build up muscles if you don't do
[00:45:01] anything it will go away in in no time
[00:45:04] it's not the case here you might forget
[00:45:06] a little bit but then with some training
[00:45:08] you get quickly to where you were before
[00:45:10] exactly yeah my problem is that if I get
[00:45:12] back to where I was before when I won
[00:45:13] the World Championship all those years
[00:45:15] ago it's not half as good as everybody
[00:45:17] is nowadays the thing about B
[00:45:19] competition the standard jumps up every
[00:45:21] year you have to keep practicing now do
[00:45:23] you think anyone's taking anything
[00:45:26] like 16 seconds for cards what it's
[00:45:30] unbelievable well people have talked
[00:45:32] about that before I'm not sure what kind
[00:45:33] of drugs would be
[00:45:35] good I remember Josh F saying rlin might
[00:45:38] be interesting whatever they're taking I
[00:45:39] want to take what would be interesting
[00:45:40] rlin it's what American kids get doed
[00:45:43] with yeah we all get doed with the raw
[00:45:46] but it sort of improves concentration it
[00:45:47] would be a sort of help for this kind of
[00:45:49] but yeah sorry speaking of Joshua 4 we
[00:45:52] just having this this funny this funny
[00:45:54] thing going on when he entered the
[00:45:55] United States and the border control
[00:45:57] when I came into the US I went to the
[00:45:58] border control to get my passport
[00:46:00] stamped the guy there like oh you're Ben
[00:46:02] fitmore you're in moonwalking with
[00:46:03] Einstein by Josh V I love that and he
[00:46:06] talked he's developing his Memory Palace
[00:46:07] he's learning memory techniques that's
[00:46:09] incredible building up it's like being a
[00:46:11] celebrity coming into the country yeah
[00:46:13] well you are no found of course and um
[00:46:17] for for a long time you were the were
[00:46:19] the the figure for memory Sports so
[00:46:22] don't don't talk yourself down there you
[00:46:25] you're still a legend long time ago now
[00:46:28] yeah but it's nice coming here and being
[00:46:29] treated like a legend seriously but I
[00:46:31] mean what I what I really appreciate
[00:46:34] about you is you're the really
[00:46:36] only super champion of memory Sports who
[00:46:40] stayed with it even though even though
[00:46:42] that others came and surpass you wait
[00:46:44] guys and I really I really think let's
[00:46:46] get this there's a minute left in this
[00:46:49] event and Everett is holding it right
[00:46:51] now 78 to 76 oh he's just trying to
[00:46:54] remember that one last yep
[00:46:56] thing three and six she she's oh she's
[00:46:59] mixed up two of her images down at the
[00:47:01] bottom there 93 and 12 but it's
[00:47:03] interesting how you can see where she's
[00:47:05] actually at the moment with her yellow
[00:47:06] highlights to check um the digits that
[00:47:09] she typed she typed in that she's at the
[00:47:11] moment at the incorrect one look look at
[00:47:13] Marlo what happened to him and here he
[00:47:15] got Everett his perfect score um what
[00:47:18] happed that CC can correct I don't know
[00:47:21] do you think he's been distracted in
[00:47:22] some way I think he has he's not f
[00:47:25] anything on his imag do you know what
[00:47:27] happened to Lance in in run two he just
[00:47:29] left the table Yeah Lance was under the
[00:47:31] impression that the um surprise task was
[00:47:33] still going on and so when even though
[00:47:35] he selected words for the next one he
[00:47:37] thought he was going to be recalling old
[00:47:38] words rather than memorizing new ones oh
[00:47:40] so he left yeah he you hat it he he
[00:47:44] reacts strongly to things like a lot of
[00:47:46] memory competitors do I don't know if
[00:47:48] you could hear the audio in here he
[00:47:49] shouted what is this what is this during
[00:47:51] the mental preparation 10 seconds and
[00:47:54] he's down 03 now he get now he got a
[00:47:56] point can you do that wasn't that
[00:47:58] distracting every do that no and I in
[00:48:01] the cards as well when he finished
[00:48:02] memorizing he clapped his hands okay he
[00:48:04] got he got his first point now Lance um
[00:48:07] he's down one to three against Marlo
[00:48:10] which is a sensation because Lance was
[00:48:12] the top Runner yesterday but on the
[00:48:15] other hand it was a bit it was a bit um
[00:48:18] foreseeable because he has never in the
[00:48:20] he was never in the final rounds and he
[00:48:22] is really specialized in what he could
[00:48:26] prepare himself with and then when the
[00:48:28] surprise EV went came in he check it out
[00:48:29] ktie got 50 5.31 seconds is that a new
[00:48:33] record by yesterday by yesterday there
[00:48:35] would have been a huge announcement oh
[00:48:37] no it's 51 I didn't see it's a new world
[00:48:39] record it's a new world record okay
[00:48:40] ladies and gentlemen we have a new world
[00:48:42] record in words and which is also
[00:48:44] Sensational because in the last two
[00:48:46] years we barely or not at all saw a
[00:48:49] world record on day two because everyone
[00:48:51] was just focusing on getting the points
[00:48:54] that didn't that's
[00:48:56] get and here we are on the camera ladies
[00:48:59] gentlemen he is the man with the head
[00:49:00] Ben pritmore right so Ben tell us are
[00:49:05] you honestly planning to take the torch
[00:49:09] back and really get into some training
[00:49:11] because what you always says I don't
[00:49:12] train I don't train I just stay here but
[00:49:15] do you do you want to come back I you
[00:49:16] can we just talked about I would like to
[00:49:18] come back people are for you it's not
[00:49:20] that I don't want to do it well it is
[00:49:22] but it's it's all psychological you know
[00:49:24] I just can't find the motivation to sit
[00:49:26] down and train and work I mean long long
[00:49:28] ago back 2003 2004 I was doing nothing
[00:49:31] but working on my systems training
[00:49:33] memory techniques it it was new it was
[00:49:35] exciting it captivated me and that's
[00:49:37] what took me to the top in the first
[00:49:39] place but ever since then it's it's hard
[00:49:41] to motivate myself to do the same thing
[00:49:43] again that I've already done in the past
[00:49:45] interesting just said the same thing
[00:49:47] does that motivate what's that does this
[00:49:48] motivate you money not in the slightest
[00:49:50] no I'm I'm famous for it
[00:49:52] no I don't care whether I have money or
[00:49:55] not it it would be nice if I had I never
[00:49:56] do I'm I'm flat foke at the moment which
[00:49:58] I always am but I really I I can't
[00:50:01] really ever use money as a motivation
[00:50:04] I'm an old school communist basically I
[00:50:06] think I would abolish money if I was the
[00:50:08] ruler of the world all together wow
[00:50:10] which will probably make people laugh if
[00:50:11] my work colleagues are watching this at
[00:50:13] home I because I am an accountant in
[00:50:15] real life are you really so you're
[00:50:17] pretty good with numbers but privately I
[00:50:20] I'm not fond of money well you you were
[00:50:21] an accountant until now yeah until now
[00:50:24] sorry guys
[00:50:26] okay so but you I feel like you just saw
[00:50:29] this you came in you're you're shown as
[00:50:30] a celebrity get the motivation back we
[00:50:33] want you to win again yes uh no
[00:50:36] disrespect floran has said that to me
[00:50:38] before you tried to motivate me with go
[00:50:39] on do it it takes a bit more than that I
[00:50:41] think it needs something to click in my
[00:50:42] brain maybe it will one day we never
[00:50:44] know and you also need a different
[00:50:46] strategy because so far you had your
[00:50:48] strategy you had your systems you you
[00:50:50] know what you were doing and you were
[00:50:51] going to the top and then other people
[00:50:53] were adopting that taking over your
[00:50:54] systems the system everyone wanted to
[00:50:57] have the double card system you were the
[00:50:59] first invting at least I will always
[00:51:01] have the credit of having been the
[00:51:03] innovator of the idea of a two card
[00:51:05] system exactly I mean it's a fairly
[00:51:06] basic idea but nobody had thought of it
[00:51:08] until that point what do you think
[00:51:09] they're talking about now Marlo and
[00:51:11] Lance as I say I always have difficulty
[00:51:13] getting into Lan's mind he's he's sort
[00:51:16] of from another planet in another way in
[00:51:18] a very nicest possible way yes right but
[00:51:21] it's true it's true and it has some it
[00:51:23] has some similarity with some people
[00:51:26] that I saw before in memory Sports also
[00:51:29] the fact that he's taking off his shoes
[00:51:31] and sits there in his socks it's great
[00:51:33] and we get that quite a bit we saw that
[00:51:35] we saw it with SM we saw it with yess
[00:51:38] yes I I think I started a trend I'm
[00:51:40] wearing matching Socks today I quite
[00:51:42] often wear OD socks at these at these
[00:51:44] competitions just because it it attracts
[00:51:46] people's attention somehow and they say
[00:51:47] oh look you're wearing different colored
[00:51:49] socks that's really cool and eccentric
[00:51:50] but look at your fellow UK competitor
[00:51:54] she just beat another record she even
[00:51:55] look like it didn't phas her she's
[00:51:57] incredible she surprised you she's
[00:51:59] relaxed she's astonishingly good at
[00:52:02] names and at words she's the best in the
[00:52:03] world at those two events she needs to
[00:52:06] the thing about the xmt is you need to
[00:52:07] sort of more roll around things so she's
[00:52:09] still working on improving her cards of
[00:52:10] images things like that if she gets to
[00:52:12] that level she will blow everybody else
[00:52:14] away right even now she's forced to be
[00:52:17] reckoned with just because she's very
[00:52:18] very hard to beat at those two
[00:52:20] disciplines now right before you start
[00:52:22] memorizing what do you do how do you do
[00:52:23] you get in like a meditation mode or I'm
[00:52:27] sitting there I close my eyes and I just
[00:52:29] run through the Journey that I'm going
[00:52:31] to use in my head what journey I have a
[00:52:33] lots I have lots of different Journeys
[00:52:36] 1,638 is that
[00:52:38] right I don't even know that you I I I
[00:52:42] created these these these Champion cards
[00:52:44] there available to download and I think
[00:52:47] that was the number that you gave me you
[00:52:48] were the only one who really gave me
[00:52:50] such a precise number at first at first
[00:52:53] you answered actually I never counted
[00:52:54] them and you you actually wrote down
[00:52:57] this this calculation process I must I
[00:52:59] must have sat down and calculated it for
[00:53:01] you but I've forgotten now we'll have to
[00:53:02] check the number it would be a multiple
[00:53:03] of 26 cuz I have 26 locations on each of
[00:53:06] my Journeys but I have a lot of Journeys
[00:53:08] but Ben what do you think about do you
[00:53:10] think about let's give us a couple
[00:53:12] examples I know some people think of
[00:53:13] Anime characters some people I have a
[00:53:15] lot of cartoon characters I have a lot
[00:53:17] of um comic book superheroes and things
[00:53:20] like that I have people I know I have
[00:53:23] lot of you know objects I have a micro
[00:53:25] phone I have a computer I have a table I
[00:53:26] have a chair among my images I have 274
[00:53:30] different images basically so there's a
[00:53:31] lot of them that come in there have I
[00:53:32] ever been in new unfortunately I didn't
[00:53:35] know who you were until this weekend no
[00:53:37] the problem with this is I created my
[00:53:39] images back in 2003 so almost nobody who
[00:53:42] I know in memory competitions now is in
[00:53:44] my IM especially ever they especially
[00:53:47] ever was he a baby at that point by the
[00:53:50] way I just realized that I followed I
[00:53:53] followed your ride
[00:53:56] um in your career life I was there 2004
[00:53:59] when you became World memory Champion
[00:54:00] for the first time wasn't it4 and then
[00:54:03] the third time you became the world Mar
[00:54:04] champion in 2009 I was there as well I
[00:54:07] just I just didn't see your second one
[00:54:08] but I was I'm I'm actually very happy
[00:54:11] the second one was barain wasn't it the
[00:54:13] second year we were in barain that was a
[00:54:14] fantastic Championship right you get to
[00:54:17] go to some incredible places this that's
[00:54:19] the wonderful thing that memory Sports
[00:54:21] has given me over the years I've been
[00:54:22] all around the world I practically never
[00:54:24] left the country before I started wow
[00:54:27] when I say the country I mean England
[00:54:28] which is like quite small compared to
[00:54:30] the rest of the world so if you're
[00:54:31] watching and you want to become a memory
[00:54:34] athlete you can go to Bahrain Singapore
[00:54:36] you can go to uh the UK some incredible
[00:54:40] places by the way ladies and gentlemen
[00:54:42] um when you are connected with me on
[00:54:44] Facebook or even if you're not connected
[00:54:45] with me on Facebook you can write me
[00:54:47] some questions and um I would see them
[00:54:49] here on my computer and we can we can
[00:54:51] ask Ben or anyone else hey look at that
[00:54:53] You' got a data card all about me yeah
[00:54:55] here's your data 1,638 I think it was
[00:54:59] right yeah here we are um oh we're
[00:55:01] starting the next event exactly let's
[00:55:03] switch to that so at table one CCE and
[00:55:06] Everett they chose words uh table two
[00:55:08] Lance and Marlo images Table Three Simon
[00:55:11] and Yan hendrik images and table four
[00:55:13] johannas and Katie is I see they haven't
[00:55:15] counted the previous event for Lance and
[00:55:17] Marlo yes they they are down one one
[00:55:19] event something must have gone on with
[00:55:20] that and we saw Marlo didn't put
[00:55:23] anything in look at cc four four words
[00:55:25] at the same time time yeah wow I I think
[00:55:28] the the highest one I ever saw was Yas
[00:55:30] from asth five and I I found that pretty
[00:55:33] crazy because you have to stack that all
[00:55:37] together but it seemed to work for these
[00:55:40] guys I I I go with Everett's Choice um
[00:55:43] of two words together I think it's a
[00:55:45] perfect it's a perfect combination it's
[00:55:47] very easy to create your images like
[00:55:49] that how do you do that I do three
[00:55:50] myself I only started using locations in
[00:55:53] that way when I came to the xmt in older
[00:55:56] competitions when I was doing words I
[00:55:57] would just string them all to together
[00:55:58] in a big long story I wouldn't split
[00:56:00] them into groups at all mhm here I do
[00:56:02] them in threes but um Simon Orton one of
[00:56:05] the organizers of the xmt he's sent me
[00:56:07] an email saying do you think you could
[00:56:08] perhaps move the words around on the
[00:56:10] screen what I do is I just stare at the
[00:56:11] little words because I find it easier
[00:56:13] just to read from a list rather than to
[00:56:14] have a few appear before me at a time
[00:56:16] Jacob Gorman sens his love from England
[00:56:18] Jake and star hello Jake and star wait
[00:56:21] what happened here guys I think they
[00:56:23] stopped ever true and CC oh dear all
[00:56:26] kinds of things going on in
[00:56:28] there we're zooming in on CC something
[00:56:32] must have happened to her screen she
[00:56:33] seems
[00:56:34] upset yeah she is she is down in her
[00:56:38] group behind Everett let's let's have a
[00:56:40] quick look here what the overall points
[00:56:43] say oh the website is not reacting
[00:56:45] anymore maybe that's that is probably
[00:56:47] what the problem is for um I think it is
[00:56:50] the images are still going on SE and Yan
[00:56:52] Hendrick yeah they're working right now
[00:56:55] yeah ktie and Johannes are tied up Simon
[00:56:58] Yan Hendrick so Simon's beating Yan
[00:57:00] Hendrick three to one and Marlo's up
[00:57:02] three nothing against Lance I thought
[00:57:04] Lance won no yeah I was just saying to
[00:57:06] floran they didn't seem to have count
[00:57:08] countered the Discover the last one we
[00:57:09] saw Marlo didn't fill anything in there
[00:57:11] must have been some technical problem I
[00:57:12] guess or perhaps some I don't know
[00:57:15] distraction problem and that's
[00:57:16] exhausting too to go through it again
[00:57:19] yeah but something has happened out
[00:57:21] there with CC and Everett as well
[00:57:23] obviously
[00:57:26] but the others are still running there
[00:57:29] yeah Yan Hendrick's got his images mixed
[00:57:32] up well I will be right back
[00:57:35] guys the coffee is running through the
[00:57:38] coffee yes yeah for me too after we
[00:57:41] switch all right so let's let's um look
[00:57:44] here Everett Everett is 3 to one in the
[00:57:47] lead um in his in his slot against CC
[00:57:51] then we have Lance Marlo Marlo in the
[00:57:53] lead with 3-0 is that accurate because L
[00:57:57] Lance just Lance just got a got a point
[00:57:59] that's what we've just been saying they
[00:58:01] obviously haven't counted the results of
[00:58:03] the images we saw Marlo didn't fill
[00:58:05] anything in so there's obviously some
[00:58:06] kind of technical problem going on you
[00:58:08] see they're doing images again now so
[00:58:09] they're redoing right that one and it
[00:58:12] looks like Marlo is winning this time
[00:58:14] although Lance may still fill in those
[00:58:17] gaps yeah we never know right but sadly
[00:58:20] we cannot hear the sound from the room
[00:58:22] at least at least the audience hears
[00:58:24] what's going on there so they are
[00:58:26] actually more informed than we are here
[00:58:28] at the commentary I think Lance is
[00:58:30] pretty badly rattled by things that have
[00:58:31] gone on at first you see he's well he's
[00:58:33] always a little agitated he's not one of
[00:58:35] those who sits Rock Solid he's always
[00:58:37] moving he's twiddling his thumbs he's
[00:58:39] and
[00:58:39] this why I didn't put him as my favorite
[00:58:42] just as my second in favorite yeah
[00:58:44] because I I see that he is so such a
[00:58:46] talented guy but he gets pretty easily
[00:58:50] shaken off by things and this is this is
[00:58:53] why I thought
[00:58:55] Marvin will have a better chance
[00:58:57] although Marvin didn't do so well
[00:58:59] yesterday but that doesn't mean anything
[00:59:01] he might he might come hard today and
[00:59:03] he's competing against Christian if we
[00:59:05] look at both skills from those two guys
[00:59:09] I think Marvin is superior than I think
[00:59:11] Marvin gets the higher scores but I he I
[00:59:14] always say Marvin does tend to wonder
[00:59:16] perform at big event like the xmt
[00:59:18] Christian is consistent he's got an old
[00:59:21] head on young shoulders he's not as
[00:59:23] young as he looks but and he has a lot
[00:59:25] of experience right he competed at so
[00:59:27] many championships already he is one of
[00:59:30] the most experienced um you are actually
[00:59:32] the number one in the world in terms of
[00:59:34] how many um competitions I think bis bis
[00:59:38] is close to you I thought bis overtook
[00:59:39] me already I don't keep count of these
[00:59:42] things but I I'm sure I remember Boris
[00:59:43] saying on Facebook I've now overtaken
[00:59:45] Ben pmore as the person who's competed
[00:59:47] in the most competitions right I
[00:59:49] actually am very high on that ladder as
[00:59:50] well although I haven't competed in ages
[00:59:52] I got 14 competitions it's not that you
[00:59:54] have many other comp in yeah when I
[00:59:57] counted that you got we at 35ish or I
[00:59:59] was just going to say it must be about
[01:00:01] since then you got a few
[01:00:03] more lad slumped over his desk like that
[01:00:06] he's he's I I envy Lance's hair it's
[01:00:08] amazing I wish I could have hair like
[01:00:10] that and look at this Marlo
[01:00:11] is 4 Z Marlo gets through to the
[01:00:14] quarterfinals and Lance is devastated
[01:00:17] look at that this is this is very
[01:00:20] dangerous this moment for him now he
[01:00:22] must he must really gets himself
[01:00:25] together otherwise otherwise he'll drop
[01:00:27] out and this is so easy to get these
[01:00:30] things to let this this thing get into
[01:00:32] your head and then it creates so much
[01:00:35] stress and adrenaline and so on he's a
[01:00:37] highly strong person it can that can be
[01:00:39] a good thing in this that do I think
[01:00:41] help him to get these super fast times
[01:00:42] he's got actually my my specialty is to
[01:00:45] talk with people in these kinds of
[01:00:47] situation I would love to go in there
[01:00:49] now and just take his hand and pet it a
[01:00:51] little bit and and give him some pet I
[01:00:54] remember the uh at the first xmt two
[01:00:56] years ago yonas he had a complete mental
[01:00:59] collapse in his he was 3-0 up and then
[01:01:01] he ended up losing 4-3 to Hannis mow
[01:01:03] right and he was absolutely devastated
[01:01:05] about this and his girlfriend came up
[01:01:06] straight afterwards and just gave him a
[01:01:08] hug and they were like standing there
[01:01:09] hugging for the next five minutes it was
[01:01:12] awesome to see yeah I think I think it
[01:01:15] would go in there as
[01:01:17] as because this I always I always do
[01:01:20] these kinds of things and I I I actually
[01:01:23] I collect these more where I can where I
[01:01:25] can help people to get out of these I I
[01:01:28] did that for johanes Malo in
[01:01:30] 2013 when he was losing against yonas
[01:01:34] from Essen trying to defend his title in
[01:01:37] London and it was nine disciplines out
[01:01:40] of 10 before the speed Cuts event and he
[01:01:43] was about to give up and I I gave him
[01:01:44] the pep talk and he went back into the
[01:01:47] room and for the first time in his
[01:01:48] career he did speed cards under 30
[01:01:50] seconds uh and I did the same with with
[01:01:53] um Yon I I mentioned this yesterday I
[01:01:56] asked yonas after his first win is he
[01:02:00] John Hunt or Nikki lder James Hunt James
[01:02:04] Hunt yeah James Hunt won the Formula 1
[01:02:07] championship once and then he kind of
[01:02:10] dropped out he didn't really care
[01:02:12] anymore and Nikki louder really kept
[01:02:14] working and did that and we are off
[01:02:18] you're going to be cut off in a second
[01:02:19] right we're GNA be doing AIO for table
[01:02:22] four Katie has chosen to do names she's
[01:02:24] up
[01:02:26] 32 at table one they're going to redo
[01:02:28] their words event and ever is up
[01:02:46] 31 no no one can hear us anymore well
[01:02:49] then I take the opportunity to quickly
[01:02:51] run to the bathroom we we are live we
[01:02:54] are Live Well everyone everyone knows
[01:02:56] now that I need to go to the bathroom
[01:02:58] thank you very
[01:02:59] much I love I love this honestly this is
[01:03:02] like this we are so professional but on
[01:03:04] the other hand we're so unprofessional
[01:03:05] this is beautiful I really want to keep
[01:03:07] it like that that's it it has some
[01:03:09] flavor I I don't want to do this normal
[01:03:12] professional sports commentating where
[01:03:14] we all are wearing suits and and we try
[01:03:15] to be super serious this is so much more
[01:03:17] fun I hate wearing suits you know that's
[01:03:20] another thing that if anybody from work
[01:03:21] is going to be watching they'll be
[01:03:22] flabbergasted because I have to wear a
[01:03:24] suit and tie for work which I hate
[01:03:26] flabber gustard what is that word
[01:03:28] flabbergasted it's a it's it's a nice
[01:03:30] word we use in England it means it
[01:03:33] sounds like a German word we've probably
[01:03:35] coopted some German word at some point
[01:03:37] in history probably I mean the entire
[01:03:39] English language was uh partly based on
[01:03:42] on germanism only half of it the Anglo
[01:03:43] Saxons but even more funnier is that the
[01:03:46] Germans are adopting English words which
[01:03:48] are incorrect in English so for example
[01:03:50] our our mobile phone is called handy and
[01:03:52] if you ever took cedo it's a smoke isn't
[01:03:54] it and I am I'm the moderator I'm the um
[01:03:58] I'm the moderator but it's called host
[01:04:00] or commentator or something like that in
[01:04:02] English uh no not moderat the show
[01:04:05] Master the show Master the show Master
[01:04:07] exactly Show Master delay Marlo is
[01:04:10] coming in he's going to talk about what
[01:04:11] just happened I shall get out of the way
[01:04:13] then shall I no no come on stay here I
[01:04:16] need to go out I mean all all of our
[01:04:18] thousands of viewers and know know now
[01:04:20] that I need to go to the bathroom anyway
[01:04:21] so I'm going now and I need to I need to
[01:04:23] give a talk to Lance anyway okay so talk
[01:04:26] to you soon in a sec a pep talk to
[01:04:28] Lance while you were here our guy in the
[01:04:30] bo I said you're off air for the moment
[01:04:32] and Florence said oh oh I need to go to
[01:04:34] the bathroom and they said no you're
[01:04:35] still AR actually we've
[01:04:38] got remember we're live here
[01:04:41] people so while you were out Marlo was
[01:04:43] beaten Lance yeah again zero they redid
[01:04:46] the images and Marlo won it so it's a
[01:04:49] straight sets win and Simon has beaten
[01:04:51] Yan hendrik Simon is always my pick for
[01:04:54] this event by the way he's my hot
[01:04:56] favorite to come and win it this year
[01:04:58] well the German you see these young
[01:05:00] people the Lancers the alexes of the
[01:05:01] world they coming and taking over Sean I
[01:05:03] think is's always so super professional
[01:05:06] so consistent at everything he is he
[01:05:08] really is amazing and he has been for
[01:05:10] many years perhaps he still has the he's
[01:05:13] the by far the best memorizer in eff to
[01:05:15] win the World Championship he came close
[01:05:16] a few years but he's he won xmt he's won
[01:05:19] the xmt yeah but I think he's still got
[01:05:21] this drive to prove that he's absolutely
[01:05:23] the best in the world so you think Sim's
[01:05:25] winning it all I have him to win yeah
[01:05:27] that would be who my money was on if I
[01:05:28] was betting on it who's he going to face
[01:05:30] in the finals Alex well I Alex you know
[01:05:33] he has to be a hot favorite as well
[01:05:36] Boris surprised everybody last year he
[01:05:38] did beat Sean in the U semi-finals and
[01:05:40] he could go far as well Johannes mow
[01:05:42] again he's the reigning Champion which
[01:05:44] perhaps has an effect on the motivation
[01:05:46] he perhaps might stumble again that's
[01:05:48] true but look at that it's Katie ver
[01:05:50] might be Katie vers Simon that will be a
[01:05:53] tough that's aough that would be a tough
[01:05:54] one Katie like I say is Unstoppable in
[01:05:57] names and words but if anyone can stop
[01:05:59] her it's Sean CU he's a real expert at
[01:06:01] those as well now how do you use your
[01:06:04] memory techniques outside of these
[01:06:08] competitions that's a question I get
[01:06:09] asked a lot and um when I answer it I
[01:06:11] get in trouble with a lot of people why
[01:06:13] because my answer is I don't use these
[01:06:15] memory
[01:06:16] techniques because there are a lot of
[01:06:18] people out there hello you know who you
[01:06:19] are who make a living by selling memory
[01:06:21] techniques to people oh and and their
[01:06:25] sales pitch for this business of theirs
[01:06:27] is to say that it will be something you
[01:06:29] can use in everyday life so when I go
[01:06:31] around and say well I personally don't
[01:06:33] use those techniques at all except for
[01:06:35] the simple party tricks of memorizing a
[01:06:36] deck of cards they reckon it's hurting
[01:06:38] their business so I've just uh fallen
[01:06:42] out of favor with a few people again
[01:06:44] well that's pretty big parties you can
[01:06:45] use
[01:06:46] it actually my ice breaker at parties is
[01:06:49] admitting that I don't remember
[01:06:50] anybody's name I am famously bad at
[01:06:52] remembering people's names it's given
[01:06:54] people no end of lefts over the years do
[01:06:56] you know my last name God now you're
[01:06:58] talking sorry am I allowed to say God on
[01:07:00] yeah you're allowed to say anything what
[01:07:01] you can say [ __ ] my God I can say [ __ ] I
[01:07:04] could be like Boris
[01:07:06] he he has he's famous for his reactions
[01:07:08] one
[01:07:09] time when he lost a competition he
[01:07:11] bellowed out sh the German word for [ __ ]
[01:07:15] talk about bis's reactions when he wins
[01:07:18] and loses I don't know if you picked
[01:07:20] that up but Lance is out yes y we've
[01:07:23] been talking about that yeah um and here
[01:07:25] comes the guy that just beat Lance Marlo
[01:07:28] Marlo sensation the sensation of the day
[01:07:31] ladies and gentlemen Mar night come on
[01:07:33] here sit down thank you we are not on
[01:07:36] camera right now we're looking in the
[01:07:38] room so look at this guy Marlo Marlo how
[01:07:41] does it feel that you just beat Lance
[01:07:43] the guy who won yesterday fantastic I
[01:07:45] really didn't expect to get through this
[01:07:46] match so I think there was there was a
[01:07:48] few problems in the match so I I wish it
[01:07:51] hadn't gone down the way it did in in
[01:07:53] some are is but really happy to be
[01:07:55] through but the surprise event you
[01:07:58] really did very well all agree did I
[01:08:01] would have got 21 if I was doing it in
[01:08:03] my head well the rest of you were doing
[01:08:05] it I was when they said it's going to be
[01:08:07] your last event I couldn't even remember
[01:08:09] what some of some of the events I wasn't
[01:08:10] sure what my last event was I mean I
[01:08:12] suppose if the names would come up you'd
[01:08:13] see the faces maybe it would jog your
[01:08:15] memory but luckily I remember my numbers
[01:08:17] what which was the last match and yeah I
[01:08:19] think I got 61 or yeah 61 it was
[01:08:22] impressive so what a sensation what a
[01:08:25] sensation you you were just qualifying
[01:08:28] the last the last of of the entire field
[01:08:31] yesterday and now you bet the one who
[01:08:34] was on the top
[01:08:37] yes yeah I mean and there was issues
[01:08:39] with the with the words um I'm not sure
[01:08:42] what happened with that so um well
[01:08:45] probably Lance should uh give his side
[01:08:47] of it I think yeah I think what happened
[01:08:50] he thought um it was it was another
[01:08:53] recall from from yesterday that he had
[01:08:54] to remember the words from yesterday
[01:08:56] maybe so when the words came up it kind
[01:08:57] of surprised him and he wasn't ready and
[01:09:00] then but then he kind of walked off it
[01:09:01] kind of distracted me I think I only
[01:09:02] scored 10 cuz I was distracted yeah but
[01:09:05] I mean yeah I don't really want to win
[01:09:08] like that I want to win fairly but you
[01:09:10] know what can I do exactly so In
[01:09:13] fairness B you've just won by being
[01:09:14] really quite awesome you know it's not
[01:09:17] it's not like you were hopeless you
[01:09:18] couldn't remember a thing you are great
[01:09:21] oh thank you another thing is I'm
[01:09:22] rooting for you against Everett I don't
[01:09:24] know if that can work out but is Everett
[01:09:26] through I haven't seen the other that's
[01:09:27] the next round I was so focused on the
[01:09:29] on the um on my match I didn't really
[01:09:31] look at anyone else they're still doing
[01:09:32] their final one ever is 3-1 up at the
[01:09:34] moment let's see let's go to
[01:09:36] the live event it looks like he's they
[01:09:39] are is he winning yeah he's winning and
[01:09:41] he did in less than 60 seconds yeah that
[01:09:44] will take him through unless CH can get
[01:09:46] back and fill in those blank she still
[01:09:48] got some she's writing in so between you
[01:09:50] both let's divide 63 by two they'll be
[01:09:53] be 30 31.5 the average age you and
[01:10:00] Everett so so so that's it yeah I'm
[01:10:03] against Everett yep you're against
[01:10:04] Everett they've not hope they not
[01:10:06] actually quite finished yet yeah it's
[01:10:07] not quite it's not but if but if it is
[01:10:10] so it's the youngest against the oldest
[01:10:11] so yeah that'll be fun that's another
[01:10:14] thing I'm thankful to you for I'm the
[01:10:16] second eldest here if I Marlo wasn't
[01:10:18] here old man Ben old man Ben I've been

[01:10:29] sorry oh thank

[01:10:33] that and it looks like it's all tied up
[01:10:36] between Kat Johannes Joe has actually
[01:10:38] beaten Katie at names and that is a
[01:10:40] pretty rare thing we don't know yet it's

[01:10:46] right now so she's still on Allan and
[01:10:49] Steven she hasn't written anything in

[01:11:28] is exactly why the xmt is so cool
[01:11:31] exactly yeah we can sit here and cheer
[01:11:33] and it's still going on exactly I love
[01:11:35] the best out of in the
[01:11:37] classical have waited forever not see
[01:11:40] any results it wouldn't be so excited
[01:11:42] before that we'd have had a room full of
[01:11:44] desks with people sitting there in
[01:11:45] absolute silence for 3 hours looking at
[01:11:47] a piece of paper it's the worst
[01:11:49] spectator spot ever but the xmt is so
[01:11:51] much cooler yes true I actually really
[01:11:53] put off that I'm doing this this old
[01:11:55] traditional pen and paper event next
[01:11:57] weekend with the US memory open no what
[01:11:59] I see is in the future we're going to be
[01:12:01] able to go inside your brain and see
[01:12:03] your memory Palace it'll be kind of
[01:12:06] creepy I'm not sure I want you inside my
[01:12:08] B give a guy a little privacy at least a
[01:12:12] little privacy no I I rather actually
[01:12:15] think that we will visualize that what I
[01:12:17] already mentioned it now several times
[01:12:19] in interviews with um technology yeah
[01:12:22] virtual reality augmented reality we go
[01:12:24] into threedimensional levels we walk
[01:12:27] around there there's Mickey Mouse
[01:12:28] jumping up and down and we have to
[01:12:30] remember that these kind of things
[01:12:32] Mickey
[01:12:32] Mouse really number 337 Mickey Mouse are
[01:12:37] you serious 337 wow yeah and I mean
[01:12:40] that's that's huge potential for us 337
[01:12:42] is Mickey Mouse 337 is Mickey Mouse he's
[01:12:44] also the three of clubs and seven of
[01:12:45] Spades and he's also the binary digit
[01:12:47] z11 z11 one one1 oh my God that's got
[01:12:53] Mickey Mouse but he's uh 317 in mind
[01:12:56] changed the uh the the the assignments
[01:12:59] for the for the numbers I changed
[01:13:01] slightly can we get that bag out of here
[01:13:03] the Yankees bag I don't like
[01:13:05] that so make I don't even know are

[01:13:21] like to try and watch the baseball
[01:13:22] because they just don't show it on
[01:13:24] wow I find it an exciting game I like
[01:13:26] hearing that
[01:13:27] yeah here we go next round this is big
[01:13:30] between ever and CC
[01:13:33] yeah ever it just needs one more win and
[01:13:36] it's images right now the the event cc
[01:13:38] is great at images she she can do times
[01:13:43] of around 16 seconds I don't know if
[01:13:45] she's going to go for super fast or if
[01:13:46] she's going to try and make sure she
[01:13:47] gets them all
[01:13:49] right there's Our IT guy Nick raing back
[01:13:52] you can see him hello sir he's waving at
[01:13:59] us here we
[01:14:06] go been more Spectators today it's more
[01:14:10] exciting this yeah they knock out bounds
[01:14:13] plus it's the weekend and here we go
[01:14:16] memorization
[01:14:22] starts
[01:14:25] pretty much the same speed there they're
[01:14:26] pretty close aren't
[01:14:29] they no no she's moving catching up well
[01:14:33] look at that she's catching up she going
[01:14:34] to stop it super fast yeah 19 so OT saw
[01:14:38] his screen going blue so now he's going
[01:14:39] to spend the rest of the minute making
[01:14:41] sure he gets all 30 right and hoping she
[01:14:43] makes a mistake now she's just reviewing
[01:14:46] in her
[01:14:47] head which I find extremely difficult
[01:14:49] for the images with the images it's much
[01:14:51] harder to review in your head yeah I I
[01:14:53] tend to look at the last six images and
[01:14:55] you know give them each your name run
[01:14:57] through my head say you know cup girl B
[01:14:58] whatever repeatedly and then when I come
[01:15:01] back to it I'm seeing the images I fill
[01:15:02] in the rest of the Gap as I go along I
[01:15:04] just do the last four in shortterm
[01:15:06] memory well I do things in threes
[01:15:07] generally so it has do the last six I do
[01:15:09] three okay I just do two per location so
[01:15:12] yeah yeah I do three at my shter memory
[01:15:14] and I I tend to always mix up the the
[01:15:18] first and the last one for for whatever
[01:15:21] reason I don't know why this is quite a
[01:15:22] common theme in my training okay now we
[01:15:25] be calling let's see what they can do so
[01:15:28] this CC really needs that win now she's
[01:15:30] starting somewhere near the
[01:15:32] bottom filling in her last she also did
[01:15:35] six there obviously that's where she um
[01:15:38] filling in the images first ever already
[01:15:40] umed those already correct that's pretty
[01:15:43] cool Everett has done his first mistakes
[01:15:45] already and everyone remember to go to
[01:15:47] extremem memory challenge.com again
[01:15:50] extreme memory challenge.com take the
[01:15:52] challenge
[01:15:54] we want a million people to take this
[01:15:55] challenge please do it it's only 5 to 10
[01:16:01] minutes silence is
[01:16:05] golden CeCe is looking like she's on
[01:16:08] fire right now seriously do support the
[01:16:10] extreme memory challenge those guys are
[01:16:12] awesome the people who it really is and
[01:16:16] let's see if you can beat Nelson cuz
[01:16:17] that's what happens at the
[01:16:19] end cc is all perfect so far
[01:16:24] this would level it up at 3 three so it'
[01:16:25] be sudden death in the final one looks
[01:16:27] really good for look at
[01:16:29] this to go everything is green on her
[01:16:32] end so far I think she finished three to
[01:16:34] go she did it two to go she did and she
[01:16:37] got got it she got it look at this this
[01:16:40] this makes them that gives her a tie now
[01:16:43] with Everett it's tied three 2
[01:16:47] three he's still
[01:16:50] going he has to keep filling his in you
[01:16:53] know just Hing she made a mistake could
[01:16:56] destroy this now is when she is getting
[01:16:58] unsecure about her choices now wouldn't
[01:17:01] be the first time
[01:17:02] today looks like she's I don't think
[01:17:04] she's clicked the Finish button so she's
[01:17:05] not 100% certain about it how's your
[01:17:08] brain feel today both of you are you
[01:17:12] exhausted who me yeah no I'm feeling
[01:17:14] good yeah feel good I was exhausted last
[01:17:16] night but I had a good sleep I'm 8 hours
[01:17:19] 7 hours I think yeah okay ready to go
[01:17:22] yes yeah let's go
[01:17:25] Marlo and look up at the top extreme
[01:17:27] memory challenge.com
[01:17:33] every knows
[01:17:41] it have a minute 40 till we're done
[01:17:44] we're it's also psychological thing when
[01:17:46] you are leading and then all of a sudden
[01:17:47] your opponent is getting one point next
[01:17:49] Point next point it really throws you
[01:17:51] off I think they Advantage the momentums
[01:17:54] now with CE isn't
[01:17:56] it we never know but know she CHS images
[01:17:59] right so he'll get the choice now mhm so
[01:18:02] what what do you think you should choose
[01:18:04] well his favorite his favorite is images
[01:18:06] I think yeah but he just went
[01:18:09] down yeah well card's pretty good I I
[01:18:12] don't know what what he I didn't see all
[01:18:14] of the match earlier on I don't know
[01:18:15] what I think he should do the surprise
[01:18:17] you can't get you can't choose the
[01:18:21] surprise
[01:18:25] a minute
[01:18:27] left don't think they're going to change
[01:18:29] anything now so we're looking at yeah
[01:18:31] we're looking at 3 three the one last
[01:18:32] decider extra time penalties to use the
[01:18:35] football analogy so
[01:18:37] sorry not football sorry real football
[01:18:41] with
[01:18:42] feet I mean that makes sense calling it
[01:18:47] football Constantin schooler from
[01:18:49] Germany former children um on Junior
[01:18:52] World m Champion is extremely happy that
[01:18:55] Ben as a co-host is here with us Ben as
[01:18:58] co- commentator is
[01:19:00] super that's kind he of him M that he
[01:19:04] should do that more that's what it means
[01:19:06] Ben was just trying to read the German
[01:19:07] text that con was writing us my German
[01:19:11] sadly is not very good It embarrasses me
[01:19:14] there's so many Germans at these
[01:19:15] competitions they all speak English
[01:19:16] perfectly my English is not very good I
[01:19:19] stumbled my way through a conversation
[01:19:21] in German and they just laugh
[01:19:23] you speak a little I speak a little I
[01:19:24] actually did a level German at school
[01:19:26] guys here we go and CC takes it home 3
[01:19:31] whoa W so now now comes the final round
[01:19:33] for them the winner of the next one will
[01:19:36] go into the quarterfinals against Marlo
[01:19:40] yeah yeah yeah I don't know I don't know
[01:19:44] which would be the best opponent for me
[01:19:47] they're both pretty
[01:19:49] good well she looks she looks excited
[01:19:52] and he is is like a little bit nervous
[01:19:54] now hases anybody try to psychologically
[01:19:56] imitate imitate you or like try to you
[01:19:59] know take you off guard before your
[01:20:03] match I don't think Lads did it
[01:20:05] deliberately people do put you off I
[01:20:07] don't know whether it's deliberate or
[01:20:08] not is it a look they give like to
[01:20:11] they right
[01:20:13] before actually so far the toughest the
[01:20:15] toughest um athlete here is I think
[01:20:17] Simon Reinhardt always is um he's so
[01:20:20] super cool all the time the Iceman James
[01:20:23] Patterson
[01:20:25] to well here we are all four of us
[01:20:28] again so with M Night from the UK with
[01:20:32] Ben pritmore from the UK yeah we have
[01:20:35] from Germany well people know us
[01:20:38] already and look at the top extreme
[01:20:40] memory challenge look at the bottom
[01:20:42] extreme memory challenge.com oh this is
[01:20:44] vice versa I don't really get it well
[01:20:47] this is like if you're a meteorologist
[01:20:48] you move this way and that way and look
[01:20:50] at the top over here we have have the
[01:20:52] Twitter feed a world record breaking day
[01:20:56] another one today awesome yesterday
[01:20:58] inredible and it was at the end of the
[01:20:59] day I thought people would get tired and
[01:21:02] exhausted but no you get keep getting
[01:21:03] better and better you get the adrenaline
[01:21:05] you see all the people do something good
[01:21:07] you get all the more driven to go and do
[01:21:09] it you don't crash out you don't feel
[01:21:11] tired until the end end of the
[01:21:12] competition then everybody slumps and
[01:21:14] goes to exactly and what all right so
[01:21:17] before this starts what did your brother
[01:21:19] say to you today did he give you any
[01:21:21] motivation uh not not today but last
[01:21:25] night we we discussed tactics like
[01:21:26] against Lance like what what games I
[01:21:28] should pick and everything I discussed
[01:21:30] it with him so and it worked out well it
[01:21:32] worked as it turn out it works out yeah
[01:21:34] surprisingly memorization starts in 5
[01:21:37] seconds and getting we're just getting a
[01:21:39] message on Facebook from katna the um
[01:21:42] coach from the Mongolian team he is
[01:21:44] super excited that his student [ __ ] is
[01:21:46] not doing so great um and yeah well
[01:21:50] props props to you cutner because you
[01:21:52] you did the most amazing thing in the
[01:21:54] entire memory Sports World you put an
[01:21:57] entire country on the map of memory
[01:21:59] Sports all your students are doing so
[01:22:02] great and um I think you have one of the
[01:22:04] biggest memory schools in the world now
[01:22:07] so let's have a look at what's going on
[01:22:08] here aett and CeCe with the with their
[01:22:11] card CeCe super fast with with a Pao I
[01:22:14] mean honestly you barely see someone
[01:22:16] being so they not M
[01:22:19] fast so close oh man
[01:22:23] seconds no you know the the the problem
[01:22:26] is do you think that ever picked up that
[01:22:28] there was a in that Split Second there
[01:22:30] was a blue screen no I can say I can say
[01:22:33] from experience you remember two years
[01:22:34] ago yonas did exactly the same to me 34
[01:22:37] seconds in the numbers it was too fast
[01:22:40] to notice the blue screen because
[01:22:42] because if he would have seen that that
[01:22:44] would really throw him off now yeah so
[01:22:47] let's just hope for his sake that he
[01:22:48] didn't put put up on that because that
[01:22:50] would be a psychological break on maybe
[01:22:53] can we get an extreme closeup of her
[01:22:55] face try to again underneath that
[01:22:59] paper here we go they both start from
[01:23:01] the bottom I like now they're here I
[01:23:03] like the paper by the way it does help I
[01:23:06] think I I think I can focus on the
[01:23:08] screen without looking at my opponent
[01:23:09] but there's always sort of the knowledge
[01:23:10] that they're there I did experiment
[01:23:12] yesterday I don't normally wear my hat
[01:23:13] when I'm memorizing I did experiment
[01:23:15] with pulling it down over my eyes like
[01:23:16] work it it didn't it's this isn't a very
[01:23:19] comfortable hat no it doesn't look this
[01:23:21] this is my spare hat that I had F along
[01:23:23] because I lost my main
[01:23:24] hat but here we go they're both filling
[01:23:27] in pretty confidently quickly it looks
[01:23:29] good it looks good but I can't believe
[01:23:31] if he a moment are on cce's side but she
[01:23:35] has look at this her last two cards and
[01:23:37] not she didn't put them in so she must
[01:23:40] have a problem with that but if she gets
[01:23:41] in all the others then that wouldn't be
[01:23:43] a problem anymore I'm pretty confident
[01:23:44] about her right now but it since she's
[01:23:46] using a Pao that means um those last two
[01:23:50] cards she might have just put into her
[01:23:52] shortterm her memory so she could easily
[01:23:54] just confuse them she probably even if
[01:23:56] she just sees those last two remaining
[01:23:58] cards she and she doesn't remember them
[01:24:00] now she might have to guess then which
[01:24:02] gives her a 50/50 chance this this is
[01:24:05] devastating for ever if he lose by lose
[01:24:08] so narrowly would be horrible he he was
[01:24:11] just he was in the lead with three Z
[01:24:12] wasn't he he was yeah so that yeah this
[01:24:15] is and he the same thing last year
[01:24:18] johannas Malo did I think he was 31
[01:24:19] actually cuz it was one1 then 21 31
[01:24:24] look get these last two no she has the
[01:24:27] switched them like exactly what I said
[01:24:30] this last remaining two cards but can
[01:24:32] Everett get all of his right he's left a
[01:24:34] couple of gaps so he's going to have to
[01:24:35] be guessing those ones this is this is
[01:24:39] incredibly exciting right now he is cut
[01:24:41] now writing us
[01:24:42] again let's see what he is saying about
[01:24:45] his student yeah he's very sorry that he
[01:24:47] cannot be with us here I think he has
[01:24:51] some political going on 50 to 43 2
[01:24:54] minutes left oh my God she just looked
[01:24:57] at the camera oh my God the entire
[01:25:00] Mongolian team is right now going crazy
[01:25:03] when they look at this
[01:25:06] there now we have to watch out for their
[01:25:08] eyes if they look at other
[01:25:12] people yeah her coach from from Mongolia
[01:25:15] is like jumping up and down right now
[01:25:17] really hoping that Everett will not be
[01:25:19] able to do this of course we will we
[01:25:22] cross our we cross our fingers for both
[01:25:24] of them but this is looking good for
[01:25:27] CeCe right now although she did this two
[01:25:29] these two mistakes we don't know if a
[01:25:32] can bring back those remaining cards how
[01:25:35] many are left there that's one two three
[01:25:38] four five six cards eight cards eight
[01:25:41] yeah I think it's six it's 52- 44 which
[01:25:44] right the numbers the numbers are K
[01:25:45] speaking for you we've got the account
[01:25:49] here well who I feel sorry for the
[01:25:51] Mongolian and take
[01:25:54] forever if
[01:25:56] few he's he's just guessing at these
[01:25:59] last gaps he's not going to get up to 50
[01:26:01] so even if CeCe doesn't correct that
[01:26:02] what what is going on with CeCe look at
[01:26:04] her she puts her hand hands on her face
[01:26:06] she's something is going on she seems
[01:26:09] she seems to be to feel maybe she's
[01:26:12] getting some superpowers right now off
[01:26:14] maybe she even corrects herself I've
[01:26:16] done this so many times we know that
[01:26:18] she's guessing these last two that she's
[01:26:20] just put in a shter memory she will be
[01:26:21] thinking to herself what I've thought to
[01:26:23] myself many times is that right should
[01:26:25] it be the other way around you you
[01:26:28] wonder oh ever it just came yeah no
[01:26:31] that's it that's it doesn't look like he
[01:26:33] will be able to correct that
[01:26:35] anymore it's Marlo versus 15 more
[01:26:40] seconds 46 50 to 46 just switch it
[01:26:45] up she can't look no oh she cannot look
[01:26:48] look at her how cute that she cannot see
[01:26:51] what's going on she's just guessing it's
[01:26:53] and it's over CeCe is in is in the
[01:26:56] quarterfinals congratulations to her she
[01:26:59] really out smart ever look at this go
[01:27:02] Mongolia hug right now he did so good I
[01:27:06] tell you what those Mongolians in the
[01:27:07] audience were so good CU you can't show
[01:27:09] the competitor that you know they've
[01:27:11] made a mistake they kept a perfect poker
[01:27:13] face which is so hard to do
[01:27:16] circumstances yeah I think I think it's
[01:27:17] incredibly that you that you mentioned
[01:27:19] that because of course everyone could
[01:27:21] suspect that when come a big each other
[01:27:24] but they're not they're so fair oh my
[01:27:27] God this is exciting she must be on the
[01:27:30] moon right now look at her she is she is
[01:27:33] glowing
[01:27:34] she look at that just really really
[01:27:38] cool poor ever though he did so great
[01:27:42] the youngest competitor of the entire
[01:27:43] field and both of them were the youngest
[01:27:45] how old is CeCe do we know I think we've
[01:27:48] been cut off 30 seconds to a surprise
[01:27:50] event about 20 seconds to surprise
[01:27:53] event um she's the youngest female in
[01:27:56] the
[01:27:58] competition yeah her her coach from
[01:28:00] Mongolia is sending is sending his his
[01:28:03] his happiness and regards and he is he's
[01:28:05] probably going crazy right now seeing
[01:28:07] this W that was that was excit name Sor
[01:28:10] the Mongolian coach's name katna well
[01:28:13] his his entire name is a little bit
[01:28:15] difficult it's
[01:28:16] Katan um kin but Canin exactly but we we
[01:28:21] just call him it's much easier and yeah
[01:28:24] like I said before he did this
[01:28:26] incredible thing um in 2009 he went to
[01:28:29] the world memory championship and he
[01:28:30] just decided hey why don't we have this

[01:30:05] in the The Thrill of the moment the
[01:30:08] great thing about memory competitions
[01:30:09] it's always so friendly you know yeah
[01:30:11] people don't have hated Rivals we have
[01:30:13] good friends who they enjoy competing
[01:30:14] against I hope it doesn't change like
[01:30:16] that I can't imagine how it
[01:30:18] would I hope it does that people don't
[01:30:20] get like robotic and
[01:30:24] where where do you see the xmt in 5
[01:30:27] years I hope that we'll be seeing the
[01:30:30] xmt little Regional XMS all over the
[01:30:33] world you know one in Britain one in
[01:30:34] Germany one in Mongolia all of the other
[01:30:36] all of the top memory countries all
[01:30:38] filtering into a big major big woohoo
[01:30:41] event like this maybe because this is
[01:30:43] something you can watch on TV because
[01:30:44] it's quick exactly yeah maybe we could
[01:30:47] expand the number of competitors maybe
[01:30:48] 24 is enough cuz the first day does drag
[01:30:50] on a bit with everybody having to play
[01:30:52] everybody else five times 8 8:00 a.m.
[01:30:54] till 5:30
[01:30:56] pm maybe sped it over two days or
[01:30:58] something like that but I think it's
[01:30:59] good with 24 competitors they've got the
[01:31:01] right
[01:31:03] number I think we're probably not we
[01:31:05] probably cut back over to
[01:31:07] them
[01:31:09] a you and I are just talking I just like
[01:31:12] to talk anyway I I don't care if
[01:31:14] nobody's listening to exactly i' sit and
[01:31:16] talk to myself no you're
[01:31:18] [Laughter]
[01:31:20] relaxing
[01:31:23] okay so about 20 seconds
[01:31:27] we from here so we're
[01:31:31] here we're still
[01:31:34] live C is Boris guys stop
[01:31:42] talk Table Three C is johanes against
[01:31:46] Yen CB and table four C A is marwin
[01:31:52] versus
[01:32:20] Christian
[01:32:33] thank
[01:32:50] you
[01:33:20] for
[01:33:38] okay
[01:33:40] so um yeah Brad can we hang out hand out
[01:33:43] the
[01:33:50] yeah
[01:33:57] so please uh we're going to hand out the
[01:33:59] rules for this first surprise event
[01:34:02] what's up
[01:34:03] Christian I'll explain
[01:34:06] yeah please don't turn them over until I
[01:34:09] tell you
[01:34:20] to
[01:34:40] so for people just entering the room the
[01:34:42] way this works this is still the round
[01:34:43] of 16 uh the second set it was the
[01:34:46] bottom of the bracket that you saw
[01:34:47] before um they're fighting to get into
[01:34:49] the quarterfinals it's the best of s
[01:34:51] seven um matches at each table so they
[01:34:54] can play a maximum of seven matches it's
[01:34:56] the first four points the first point
[01:34:59] will be decided by what I'm about to
[01:35:02] announce the surprise event which is a
[01:35:04] previously unknown memory task that they
[01:35:07] will have to
[01:35:09] perform okay so uh this next explanation
[01:35:13] for this surprise event will come in
[01:35:15] three parts um and after each part I
[01:35:19] just want to make sure that everybody
[01:35:20] understands what I've said there may be
[01:35:22] questions um as these parts come but
[01:35:25] everything will be revealed um but feel
[01:35:27] free to ask questions we won't move on
[01:35:29] until everybody's
[01:35:31] comfortable so this is a new kind of
[01:35:33] surprise
[01:35:35] event you you can turn your sheets over
[01:35:37] actually there's a new kind of surprise
[01:35:39] event where your recall time will be
[01:35:44] time or did you hear that your recall
[01:35:47] time will be time on the
[01:35:49] screen these are the set of rules you
[01:35:53] can turn your recall sheet or your you
[01:35:54] can turn your instruction sheet over so
[01:35:58] the max time allowed will be 5 minutes
[01:36:00] this event is five minutes you can stop
[01:36:02] your recall timer by CL by clicking the
[01:36:05] Finish button before the 5 minutes are
[01:36:07] up if you choose the person who recalls
[01:36:10] the most items I'll reveal what those
[01:36:12] items are wins if both competitors
[01:36:15] recall the same number of items then the
[01:36:17] person with the fastest recall time wins
[01:36:20] the scoring is one point for a correctly
[01:36:22] placed item no penalty for a mistake so
[01:36:25] it's very similar to
[01:36:27] how uh it works with the normal events
[01:36:30] except there's only recall and the
[01:36:32] recall time is the
[01:36:34] tiebreaker right everything you get
[01:36:36] correct as you place it is worth one
[01:36:39] point does everyone understand
[01:36:42] that I need a yes from
[01:36:46] everyone yes do you mean's no Rec's no
[01:36:49] memorization right
[01:36:52] I I'll explain what you're you'll be
[01:36:53] recalling but you won't have to memorize
[01:36:57] anything
[01:36:58] okay okay so yesterday everyone
[01:37:02] memorized cards images words names and
[01:37:05] numbers in several matches right each
[01:37:14] had yeah so if if from the Mongolian
[01:37:17] team if you have questions we'll go
[01:37:18] slowly to make sure you understand
[01:37:21] understand so
[01:37:25] far
[01:37:26] okay
[01:37:30] um I guess can you tell him
[01:37:33] can you
[01:37:35] say have
[01:37:50] question
[01:37:52] all right well let me maybe get further
[01:37:54] and then I can as I reveal stuff we can
[01:37:56] tell me so as I said we REM we memorized
[01:38:00] five different types of things yesterday
[01:38:02] we had three matches in each of those
[01:38:05] events okay your task will be to recall
[01:38:08] something you memorized yesterday it
[01:38:10] will be one of these five categories so
[01:38:13] no memorization you've already memorized
[01:38:15] it from yesterday it's only going to be
[01:38:17] the recall of one of those
[01:38:20] events after I announce what it is and
[01:38:22] we won't do that just yet I'll there'll
[01:38:25] be a 10-second countdown on your screen
[01:38:27] and then it'll go straight into the
[01:38:29] recall for that
[01:38:30] event does anyone does everyone get
[01:38:35] that
[01:38:40] yep the
[01:38:48] original no right the correct
[01:38:51] than so hopefully you got it all right
[01:38:53] and if you didn't hopefully you saw the
[01:38:55] mistakes and you made a note of it we
[01:38:58] worked out a way
[01:39:02] that
[01:39:11] for don't recall
[01:39:20] your
[01:39:40] minutes no
[01:39:45] memorization you you'll understand when
[01:39:47] you see the
[01:39:50] screen
[01:39:55] okay so so I'd like everybody to press
[01:39:57] ready because as soon as I give more
[01:40:01] information I'll give you a warning
[01:40:02] don't worry um we're going to go
[01:40:04] straight into it it's one of these
[01:40:06] things where we want you to recall it on
[01:40:09] the spot not have time to really think
[01:40:11] about it the time to think about it is
[01:40:12] that recall time that's why it's
[01:40:19] time
[01:40:31] [Music]
[01:40:43] okay so if you can press
[01:40:48] ready okay so you will be remembering so
[01:40:52] there was the first one of the day you
[01:40:54] had a second match and a third match
[01:40:56] right let's say it was one of the five I
[01:40:59] I'll tell you which five it what one of
[01:41:01] the five it is before we do it but just
[01:41:03] to let you know it's the last one so
[01:41:06] think of all your five different events
[01:41:08] right cards names numbers words images
[01:41:11] the last the third match you had where
[01:41:14] you memorize them that's what you will
[01:41:16] be recalling one of
[01:41:18] those is that clear
[01:41:26] third the
[01:41:29] last it's not your last match of the day
[01:41:32] it's the last one of whatever I tell you
[01:41:36] got
[01:41:38] it for me there was um in one of the
[01:41:41] disciplines the
[01:41:43] changed does it affect it well no
[01:41:47] because the one the ones you did were
[01:41:49] all just think of the last ones you did
[01:41:51] but I did my last cards before lunch and
[01:41:55] then repeated cards which were the first
[01:42:01] match but the one you redid was your
[01:42:04] first cards wasn't it and and you redid
[01:42:07] the first and second
[01:42:10] cards you did your redo the first and
[01:42:12] second cards right
[01:42:19] after
[01:42:22] it will be the last match you had during
[01:42:25] the day whether that was supposed to be
[01:42:27] the first or the
[01:42:30] second would be the last match you
[01:42:32] actually had in that event during the
[01:42:35] day last I actually had the last you you
[01:42:38] actually had regardless of whether that
[01:42:40] was supposed to be the first or second
[01:42:41] or
[01:42:42] third is that clear
[01:42:45] yeah okay so if if that's clear we're
[01:42:48] going to start I'm going to say what it
[01:42:50] is which events one of the
[01:42:57] five just trying to make this very clear
[01:42:59] so nobody has a hiccup so what I'll
[01:43:02] announce what it is so I'll say one of
[01:43:04] those five words cards names words
[01:43:06] images numbers and then we'll we'll go
[01:43:09] it'll be 10sec countdown and you'll see
[01:43:11] the recall screen it'll be clear what it
[01:43:13] is anyways because the recall screens
[01:43:15] are all kind of independent right
[01:43:17] they're all unique is everybody ready
[01:43:24] so the event that you'll be recalling is
[01:43:27] the last match of
[01:43:49] numbers
[01:43:59] looks like he's still
[01:44:02] talking and we are back we're still on
[01:44:06] round of
[01:44:07] 16 we just saw some people move on to
[01:44:10] the next round it was a huge upset by
[01:44:12] CCE she beat Everett she came back from
[01:44:15] down 3 it was it was certainly the most
[01:44:19] surprising moment of the morning um
[01:44:23] Everett was was doing incredibly he was
[01:44:26] in the lead was it 31 or something like
[01:44:30] 3 and all of a sudden CeCe just won um
[01:44:35] one after another and she Bel him
[01:44:37] 43 and went into the fin into the
[01:44:40] quarterfinals against Maro Knight and
[01:44:43] now we are in the um in the second part
[01:44:46] of the first round of 16 we have the
[01:44:50] remaining eight competitors now I would
[01:44:53] really look at table three with their
[01:44:55] surprise event yeah this is the one that
[01:44:57] we had already had in the morning these
[01:44:59] guys didn't hear what was going on in
[01:45:00] the morning they were being separated in
[01:45:03] a different room so they just heard the
[01:45:06] rules they need to remember something
[01:45:08] from yesterday and look at this Alex oh
[01:45:11] my God he really remembers nearly
[01:45:13] everything from yesterday so far best
[01:45:15] Yan as well 78 oh she just corrected
[01:45:18] something there but nevertheless I mean
[01:45:21] these These are amazing results Johannes
[01:45:23] is completely lost that at the moment he
[01:45:25] has one correct digit Jes I think he
[01:45:28] must be recalling a different numbers
[01:45:30] Marvin Marvin is doing a really good job
[01:45:33] he has no mistakes so far Christian
[01:45:35] weaved in a couple of mistakes but also
[01:45:37] memorized remembered most of it yet pfia
[01:45:41] versus Boris Boris is doing pretty good
[01:45:44] but has a lot of gaps there while
[01:45:46] parafia did perfectly up until nearly
[01:45:49] the last row and now he has a lot of
[01:45:50] mistakes but still gives him an huge
[01:45:52] advantage over Boris
[01:45:55] um s got about half of um of his digits
[01:46:00] there 44 out of
[01:46:02] 80 they still have a lot of time Alex
[01:46:04] just put in one single mistake there but
[01:46:07] it's a brilliant result from him that
[01:46:10] that's the best result we have seen so
[01:46:11] far in this uh I think in the round
[01:46:14] before was Katie yeah who had the best
[01:46:17] result Alex is still thinking about that
[01:46:18] last one he0 right he knows that this
[01:46:22] seems to be incorrect so very impressive
[01:46:26] from Alex he is he has such a good
[01:46:28] memory um same Yan she is she is she's
[01:46:33] at the right she's at the right spot she
[01:46:35] also knows something is off
[01:46:39] there right well this this is really
[01:46:43] this is so such a difficult thing to do
[01:46:45] because we're very much geared in these
[01:46:47] memory competitions to remembering
[01:46:49] something recalling it straight away and
[01:46:51] then blanking our brains out again in
[01:46:52] preparation for the next exactly look at
[01:46:54] look at Alex he just corrected one he's
[01:46:56] now at 78 I mean honestly just just the
[01:46:58] mere fact to remember which Journey you
[01:47:01] used there yesterday because they had so
[01:47:03] many so many events that just this that
[01:47:06] this one fact alone already makes it
[01:47:08] very difficult I was sitting there in
[01:47:09] the audience doing it for myself at the
[01:47:11] start but look at this johanes is now
[01:47:12] getting it h he's getting back to it
[01:47:15] looks not really good but it's getting
[01:47:17] better
[01:47:18] now um yeah sorry I just say I had to I
[01:47:22] couldn't remember when I my last numbers
[01:47:24] one was I had to run through the last
[01:47:25] couple of Journeys I knew I did and see
[01:47:27] if I could come across any images that
[01:47:28] looked like they were properly numbers
[01:47:30] right work it out that way I find it
[01:47:33] very interesting um to to follow what's
[01:47:35] going on through in the last three years
[01:47:37] with surprise events so someone who
[01:47:40] wants to compete next year really should
[01:47:43] get systems ready that is um that are
[01:47:45] able to memorize letters for example we
[01:47:48] had we had driver we had um
[01:47:51] license plates we had now this year um
[01:47:53] the surprise event that we haven't
[01:47:54] really done yet that's for the
[01:47:56] semi-final no for the finals for the
[01:47:58] finals it's a thousand digits and
[01:48:00] letters and they already have been
[01:48:01] handed out these sheets and if you think
[01:48:04] you will make it to the finals you you
[01:48:05] better start memorizing that sooner or
[01:48:08] later um and other things we had the
[01:48:12] textures last year so so you you better
[01:48:15] get an idea at least of how you could do
[01:48:17] something like that and now we having
[01:48:19] the fact of um remembering when you did
[01:48:22] what so at least you should have
[01:48:25] something like a strategy for knowing
[01:48:27] exactly what kind of Memory Palace you
[01:48:29] use at what part of the competition I'm
[01:48:31] not really suggesting to anyone that
[01:48:33] they should remember all of their things
[01:48:35] that would be crazy and probably this
[01:48:36] event will not come back anyway right so
[01:48:40] but nevertheless people need to prepare
[01:48:42] themselves for all these eventualities
[01:48:44] in the surprise event so that they have
[01:48:45] at least a strategy that that might work
[01:48:48] out for that if you don't have a
[01:48:50] strategy that allows you to memorize
[01:48:52] letters you might really have a
[01:48:54] disadvantage time is up time up up we
[01:48:56] have Alex one Pia by one digit whoa over
[01:49:00] Boris 78 that's brilliant and yeah Pia
[01:49:05] versus Boris that's oh my that was a big
[01:49:07] big disappointment for Boris he probably
[01:49:10] wasn't too happy about that when Boris
[01:49:12] is not happy or Boris is happy we know
[01:49:14] about it you can hear it from here and
[01:49:15] we're about 100 yards away well he look
[01:49:17] he still he still looks okay there when
[01:49:20] we um when we look at him here he is of
[01:49:23] course he's he's already picking his
[01:49:25] nose there a lot but I know picking his
[01:49:27] nose is the wrong description no that's
[01:49:29] right I think that's what he's doing
[01:49:31] yeah I do it myself a lot to be honest
[01:49:33] so you know we get these Camas on me I
[01:49:36] don't think about it at the time and
[01:49:39] Marvin versus Christian Marvin got 71
[01:49:41] against 63 so Marvin got a point
[01:49:44] there3 right so that gives so so the
[01:49:48] winners can now choose the losers choose
[01:49:51] Los choose the losers choose the next
[01:49:53] event but this is incredible we had
[01:49:55] three people that were in the 70s for
[01:49:57] the surprise event last time it was only
[01:49:59] 60s yeah yeah they were actually doing
[01:50:01] better than the first Alex Mullen is
[01:50:03] just unbelievable Alex is absolutely
[01:50:06] amazing he's come out of nowhere in the
[01:50:07] last few years he's not just caught up
[01:50:10] with the people who've been doing it for
[01:50:11] years he's surpassed them although I
[01:50:13] don't like to say these kind of things I
[01:50:16] I think he really is a talented guy
[01:50:18] because I don't like to bring talent in
[01:50:20] our sport because everyone can do that
[01:50:23] and we haven't really seen the end of it
[01:50:24] yet but Alex seems to be one who is so
[01:50:26] effortly doing all of these things that
[01:50:29] you can probably really say that he's a
[01:50:32] talented memory athlete while all the
[01:50:34] others are very hardworking memory
[01:50:36] athletes he's probably also works very
[01:50:38] hard as well let's not take that away
[01:50:40] from him he's especially he's U doing a
[01:50:42] regular training yes where well many
[01:50:44] others have a season of one month two
[01:50:47] months three months of hard training
[01:50:49] he's just doing it every day throughout
[01:50:52] his um yeah his entire memory career and
[01:50:55] that's I think something that really is
[01:50:57] paying off and I always suggested also
[01:51:00] to my students try to find a certain
[01:51:02] amount of time a day doesn't have to be
[01:51:04] too much Alex didn't 30 minutes but
[01:51:06] maybe even if you do 15 minutes it can
[01:51:09] be already so beneficial if you do it
[01:51:11] every day but that's a hard thing to do
[01:51:13] because we all have our routines and to
[01:51:16] put something new into the routine is
[01:51:18] tough so let's go back to the next
[01:51:20] events so s just picked
[01:51:24] images and now Boris picked images for
[01:51:28] table two and table three Johannes
[01:51:31] picked cards and table four Christian
[01:51:33] picked words so this is interesting that
[01:51:35] Boris picked images because he knows
[01:51:37] that pfia already did in training world
[01:51:39] record images so that means that bis is
[01:51:42] very confident about his own skill here
[01:51:43] as well perhaps he just convinced that
[01:51:46] per is going to make a mistake and try F
[01:51:48] time EXA exactly so it might be a
[01:51:50] strategic thing that he did there and he
[01:51:52] will just go for 60 seconds and hope
[01:51:54] that pfia is going too fast and puts
[01:51:59] ined and look at Pia how fast he is
[01:52:02] flying through this I'm surprised by his
[01:52:04] picked images I would have expected him
[01:52:06] to go for names or words yeah exactly
[01:52:09] watching the xmt one ofor maybe it's
[01:52:12] also putting um perf in a in a difficult
[01:52:15] spot in order what what to pick next
[01:52:17] right yeah here we go Alex
[01:52:20] looks like s is going at a faster
[01:52:27] Pace wow and bar bis and P
[01:52:31] oh9
[01:52:34] and going slowly and takes the entire
[01:52:37] time so Boris is in the that's
[01:52:39] interesting yja has done cards in
[01:52:48] 28.668150 a personal best for her if she
[01:52:51] gets that right which is a good time to
[01:52:52] do it
[01:52:54] yeah it looks like marwin andrish are
[01:52:56] taking their time it's word so we'd
[01:52:58] expect both of those I think to use the
[01:52:59] full 60 seconds but we they going make
[01:53:01] do in 58 seconds or in 55 seconds let's
[01:53:07] see oh both of them did in 60
[01:53:11] seconds right that's interesting I
[01:53:13] really don't understand why they do that
[01:53:15] well sometimes you don't want to it
[01:53:16] doesn't it's not just a matter of saving
[01:53:18] half a second it's thinking to oh I
[01:53:20] should stop the clock now we're getting
[01:53:21] up to 60 seconds it cuts 3 or 4 seconds
[01:53:23] off the time and you want to use the
[01:53:25] whole thing I myself normally wait for
[01:53:26] the whole 60 seconds but don't you agree
[01:53:29] that it's smarter to go no I don't I
[01:53:32] agree I I would agree if it was a case
[01:53:33] of saving .01 seconds as Hannah has
[01:53:36] somehow done in the cards here 59.99
[01:53:39] right but if it's if if it's it's really
[01:53:41] you have to stop stop memorizing think
[01:53:43] you have to keep an eye on the clock you
[01:53:45] have to think I'll stop it just before
[01:53:47] the end so as to gain an advantage in
[01:53:48] the case of a tie it takes more time I
[01:53:51] think than it's worth so I don't hold
[01:53:52] with doing that myself really I I mean
[01:53:55] it's a matter of opinion of course you
[01:53:58] are way better memorizer than I am but I
[01:54:01] I I tend to disagree with that because
[01:54:03] um when you already have the 60 seconds
[01:54:05] then you memorize it probably in let's
[01:54:07] say 30 seconds if you take it slow and
[01:54:09] then you repeat and you repeat and while
[01:54:11] you do that you can have um an eye on
[01:54:14] the clock and and stop a little bit
[01:54:16] earlier without having a huge
[01:54:18] disadvantage of well I think different
[01:54:20] things work for different people it's
[01:54:21] positive thinking that counts for most
[01:54:23] in these M competitions if you think
[01:54:25] it's an advantage it will be an
[01:54:26] advantage to you if I think it's not an
[01:54:28] advantage it won't be an advantage to me
[01:54:29] true in the mind look at Alex he already
[01:54:32] finished but Alex he obviously took the
[01:54:35] full 60 seconds for images which is
[01:54:37] three times as long as he needs but so
[01:54:39] he he can be confident and get it right
[01:54:41] without having to think poal s has all
[01:54:43] the pressure on him and he's spending a
[01:54:45] lot of time thinking there yeah that
[01:54:47] doesn't really is a good sign especially
[01:54:49] in the IM mes discipline where things
[01:54:51] either come effortless or you have a
[01:54:54] problem
[01:54:58] exactly and now Alex is just going
[01:55:00] through his head through his Memory
[01:55:02] Palace can you flick over to the cards
[01:55:04] I'm curious about how Yen's doing that
[01:55:06] fast time it inges me let's go a table
[01:55:09] three doesn't look too bad but she has
[01:55:10] already four mistakes in there and a lot
[01:55:13] of omissions so I think it will be tough
[01:55:17] for her to get that back but you never
[01:55:18] know Johan looks super confident his
[01:55:20] last cards are going into the right slot
[01:55:22] right now he's done I like this whoever
[01:55:25] that is his rat
[01:55:27] tail right I don't know if it's a delate
[01:55:29] one of an accidental
[01:55:31] right there it is right
[01:55:34] there now come along we're not going to
[01:55:36] start criticizing people's
[01:55:38] hair everyone would make fun of floran
[01:55:40] for going bed oh come on but he's got a
[01:55:43] beautiful head thank thanks for
[01:55:44] mentioning that I'm I'm I'm coming I'm
[01:55:46] coming to where you are not have you
[01:55:48] have you spotted mine have you spotted
[01:55:50] my little eyes that I have on
[01:55:52] the there's nothing wrong with losing
[01:55:54] your hair that's true it just shows
[01:55:56] you've got a big brain that's what I
[01:55:57] like ex I actually want to get a really
[01:55:59] nice um haircut and shave everything off
[01:56:02] because I have a good head for you
[01:56:03] should go with theu but did San Diego if
[01:56:06] you want to go anywhere you need a need
[01:56:08] a car and drive for hours in all
[01:56:09] directions and I didn't really have the
[01:56:10] time for doing that so
[01:56:14] anyhow yeah y's not there I'm afraid
[01:56:16] she's not going to get close to getting
[01:56:18] no she is not well she might it's not
[01:56:21] like move everything to the left like
[01:56:23] she's worn out there's other mistakes
[01:56:25] now now let's s the table to guys the
[01:56:26] cards are correct table B has got two
[01:56:31] mixed
[01:56:33] up we have 40 seconds left oh poor Boris
[01:56:36] look at that he just makes up these two
[01:56:38] he might switch it I think we need the
[01:56:40] camera on boris's reaction whether he
[01:56:41] gets it right or not it will on Boris
[01:56:43] here let's stay on Boris with that let's
[01:56:45] hear the n Sound of Boris he will go
[01:56:48] crazy actually I would like to switch
[01:56:50] off our our sound here and pull up the
[01:56:52] the the audio so we can hear what's
[01:56:54] going on but I mean on the other hand
[01:56:56] when we see what's going we can imagine
[01:56:58] what what came out there Boris all you
[01:57:00] have to do is switch it look at this bis
[01:57:02] biting his nails chewing on his finger
[01:57:05] he doesn't know come on Boris you can do
[01:57:08] that is that Mar
[01:57:10] back he doesn't look like he's going to
[01:57:12] change seconds
[01:57:16] four hold it hold
[01:57:18] it
[01:57:20] oh no
[01:57:22] Boris bis well it wasn't one of his
[01:57:26] famous reactions but C very happy about
[01:57:30] that what does it look like now he is
[01:57:32] now in two behind all
[01:57:37] right Boris is an incredible human being
[01:57:39] he works at the max institution Alex is
[01:57:42] two up again s the other two are tied
[01:57:45] and you know Boris studied two subject
[01:57:47] at the same time I think he studied um
[01:57:50] physics and psychology and then when he
[01:57:53] when he finished with fantastic scores
[01:57:56] at the same time in the normal regular
[01:57:58] in the normal regular time he made his
[01:58:00] PhD not in physics not in Psychology but
[01:58:03] in Neuroscience bring everything
[01:58:05] together there and now he's at Dart
[01:58:07] NeuroScience it's perfect from him no
[01:58:09] he's no no no I mean we're here right
[01:58:11] now right EXA yeah but he's working at
[01:58:13] the max table three ninja names names at
[01:58:16] table three and marwin at table four
[01:58:33] numbers anyway so the slight
[01:58:35] visualization is important but not the
[01:58:38] full one can you tell us when we are
[01:58:40] back on I will yes look now you're in
[01:58:43] lower third there I know look at that
[01:58:45] Ben P the
[01:58:48] commentator
[01:58:50] all right we we are back on on on the
[01:58:52] live feed here I was just mentioning
[01:58:54] that Boris um he did his he did this
[01:58:58] thesis for his PhD study where he was
[01:59:01] trying to figure out how important the
[01:59:03] visualization skill is and he assumed
[01:59:05] that it might be super important for a
[01:59:08] for a memorizer and he figured out that
[01:59:12] it is actually the detail and the amount
[01:59:14] of visualization is is not really
[01:59:16] beneficial at all but you still need
[01:59:19] some visualization so what I took out of
[01:59:22] that is that I advise all my students
[01:59:24] that they should create like the drawing
[01:59:26] of a three-year-old in their mind and
[01:59:28] that's that's enough they don't need to
[01:59:29] figure out how the buttons and and all
[01:59:31] the hairs arranged on their characters
[01:59:34] because that would go too far and
[01:59:35] wouldn't help them would just slow them
[01:59:36] down it's true actually when I'm
[01:59:38] memorizing the images on my head aren't
[01:59:40] very detailed at all sometimes they're
[01:59:42] just more of an idea than a picture
[01:59:44] themselves there's nothing actual visual
[01:59:46] in my head at all just so the name of
[01:59:48] the person or the image
[01:59:51] let's see what matches we've got for
[01:59:53] this third round we have two cards a
[01:59:56] names and a numbers two cards names and
[01:59:59] a
[02:00:01] number which table are we looking at now
[02:00:03] Ben what do you want to
[02:00:05] see let's see yena will probably win the
[02:00:08] names that's her speciality cards per
[02:00:12] you hav Boris that might be interesting
[02:00:14] I'm picking Boris for that one and cards
[02:00:17] Alex you have to you'd have to count on
[02:00:18] Alex I think he's not only super fast
[02:00:20] but he I think he'll thrive in the
[02:00:22] pressure of the situation to do
[02:00:25] something amazing and marwin too I'm
[02:00:26] picking for numbers I don't know I can
[02:00:29] see Christian winning that one it will
[02:00:31] be an interes comptition anyway and here
[02:00:34] we go yeah they just started Boris with
[02:00:37] his double card system interesting pev
[02:00:39] job is doing one card at a time because
[02:00:42] Boris told me that he is actually
[02:00:44] preferring using a single card system
[02:00:46] for the small for the short disciplines
[02:00:49] so really he maybe maybe he just puts
[02:00:52] two images of his single system together
[02:00:55] on one location he's not using it his
[02:00:56] double card system for this see when I
[02:00:58] first created the two card system I got
[02:01:01] much slower at speed cards with than I
[02:01:03] was with the one card system but I made
[02:01:05] the absolute decision straight away to
[02:01:07] drop the one card system and use the two
[02:01:08] card system for everything because I
[02:01:09] knew in the long run I would get better
[02:01:11] at it wow look how slow Alex is today
[02:01:14] with a 23.8 one oh yeah Alex is taking
[02:01:17] it easy today he knows seni I don't
[02:01:20] think can do less than 30 seconds so
[02:01:22] he'll have taken a Brea just I I can't
[02:01:25] believe that 23.8 1 seconds is slow it
[02:01:28] say slow time
[02:01:29] exactly what was your best time you ever
[02:01:31] did the best time I think I ever did in
[02:01:33] competition was 24.9 7 that was your old
[02:01:36] record wasn't it that was the world
[02:01:37] record at one point yeah when when did
[02:01:38] you do that I wish I remember you were
[02:01:41] filming it you were there at the time I
[02:01:42] know it's available on YouTube you can
[02:01:44] go on the memory Sports it is too
[02:01:47] congratulations on that yeah I can't
[02:01:49] remember what year it was it must have
[02:01:50] been 2008 or 2009 maybe it's the most
[02:01:54] it's the most watched um memory Sports
[02:01:57] video on YouTube I think it really
[02:02:01] is yeah that's another thing I like to
[02:02:03] post about I was the first person ever
[02:02:04] to do a deck of cards in under 30
[02:02:06] seconds in a competition that was the
[02:02:08] Holy Grail of memory for many years
[02:02:09] there was the German memory Championship
[02:02:11] 2009 wasn't it it the first time I did
[02:02:13] it actually was the UK Championship 2007
[02:02:15] the 24.9 7 was at that German
[02:02:17] Championship that's what was 26 28 I
[02:02:21] think wow marwin is really but now those
[02:02:23] scores look hopeless everybody does
[02:02:25] those without taking a sweat look how
[02:02:27] quickly he's putting things together yep
[02:02:30] Marin has got his head together here
[02:02:32] he's I honestly thought he would be
[02:02:33] making a mistake in that so I'm sorry
[02:02:35] Marvin I'm just I never thought oh he
[02:02:38] made a mistake and he corrected it
[02:02:41] straight away just a
[02:02:43] t thank you Marvin you're really working
[02:02:47] on making my predictions coming closer
[02:02:49] to
[02:02:51] reality so now
[02:02:54] it's oh it's it's close between so this
[02:02:58] this is a clear win for Marvin if he
[02:03:01] does Alex has his complete pack in
[02:03:05] that like predicted very confident and
[02:03:08] her name score Johan's probably already
[02:03:11] given up before before yanis is not so
[02:03:14] good at names he's better than me but
[02:03:16] everybody is but he's not as good as
[02:03:17] most yeah s through I'm the worst in the
[02:03:20] world at names not the world oh yeah the
[02:03:23] world which by which by the way is like
[02:03:27] a better than me absolutely yes L I was
[02:03:30] saying it's all about positive thinking
[02:03:31] but sadly the the idea is in my head
[02:03:33] unless I get a serious blow to the head
[02:03:35] and forget that I'm bad at names I'm
[02:03:36] always going to be bad at names have you
[02:03:37] ever have you ever considered using a
[02:03:38] nam's database where you have pre-made
[02:03:40] images for the most common names because
[02:03:42] I do that with my students and it works
[02:03:44] so well I have thought about it but the
[02:03:45] problem is I don't want to this is it's
[02:03:49] this thing in my head I I don't do
[02:03:51] anything that isn't Fun and the idea of
[02:03:53] practicing names because I have this
[02:03:55] preconceived idea that I'm bad at it I
[02:03:56] just don't enjoy at all well let's get
[02:03:58] rid of that exactly let's let's get rid
[02:04:00] of it because you recommend because this
[02:04:02] is very much so yes thank you oh yeah me
[02:04:03] too please
[02:04:05] but be experiment I hate that never mind
[02:04:08] I put it in my
[02:04:12] mouth what was I saying before I had
[02:04:14] this horrible toothpast you tast in my
[02:04:16] mouth names names yes you were ranting
[02:04:18] about names never get good at I do that
[02:04:20] quite a lot shall we change the subject
[02:04:22] actually and talk about other people
[02:04:23] instead of yeah let's talk about this
[02:04:24] event right now cuz there's a minute
[02:04:25] left in the event and Boris is still
[02:04:28] down he has 36 correct cards he but he
[02:04:31] did in 29 seconds and prev JV is already
[02:04:35] done yeah bis is struggling he's not
[02:04:37] going to come play to pack yanas is
[02:04:39] coming back
[02:04:40] though 21 to 26 and he did it under 60
[02:04:44] seconds yeah safe he did the Florian
[02:04:46] method That's Not My Method m
[02:04:51] I don't think yis can beat yeno at names
[02:04:53] if he does it would be a real
[02:04:55] shocker cuz he doesn't normally get
[02:04:58] above say low 20s and she is normally
[02:05:01] somewhere close to 30 we have a tweet
[02:05:03] from uh by galma Bev JV good job
[02:05:09] CeCe here we go 30 seconds
[02:05:12] left Boris is still down he has 39
[02:05:16] correct
[02:05:17] cards Alex is just waiting
[02:05:20] contemplating so Alex looks like he's
[02:05:23] going to go 3-0 up yeah and
[02:05:25] so oh bis this is this will be
[02:05:29] devastating there he is no and now now
[02:05:32] bis is in in this psychological mood
[02:05:34] where it really gets tough for him
[02:05:36] because one more game and who will be
[02:05:39] exactly he needs four wins now to
[02:05:41] continue let's get a big zoom in on his
[02:05:43] face it's so difficult at this point I
[02:05:45] mean CC did that in the morning so it's
[02:05:48] not impossible possible to do that but
[02:05:49] if you're already so agitated it
[02:05:51] releases so many hormones in your brain
[02:05:54] well you see the thing about Bob is he's
[02:05:55] always agitated he is so madly
[02:05:58] passionate about this it might be to an
[02:05:59] advantage for him true and he's so
[02:06:01] experienced also so that is a huge
[02:06:04] Advantage for him but nevertheless it
[02:06:06] will be extremely difficult to pull that
[02:06:09] off he needs to win everything now four
[02:06:11] matches Florian look at johannas
[02:06:14] again he's down down in the count he
[02:06:17] lost I think I think would have expected
[02:06:19] to lose that one well love for johannas
[02:06:21] it looks much better he's just down one
[02:06:23] against two for Yan he can he can easily
[02:06:26] pull that off and and last year he
[02:06:28] already did that yeah that's right and
[02:06:30] names is the only one where Yan is
[02:06:32] unquestionably better than him at words
[02:06:34] they're perhaps quite evenly matched at
[02:06:36] the other things I think cannis has the
[02:06:37] advantage
[02:06:39] honestly think he will he can easily
[02:06:41] pull that off if he can keeps it up um
[02:06:44] psychologically it's always huge thing
[02:06:47] if you're if your head is playing with
[02:06:50] you if you give up too early then you
[02:06:53] have basically no chance so let's talk
[02:06:55] about s and Alex what can his strategy
[02:06:58] possibly be here he gets the choice of
[02:07:00] the next event what is he going to
[02:07:01] choose to try and win to try and stay in
[02:07:04] this that's that's a very good question
[02:07:06] what what can you do against a a guy
[02:07:08] against Alex who's so good at all these
[02:07:10] events he's a world memory Champion he
[02:07:11] just did two Amazing World Records
[02:07:14] yesterday but the thing the great thing
[02:07:16] about that what I learned he's actually
[02:07:17] nervous Alex he doesn't look it but he
[02:07:20] is what's up I'm gonna sque Nelson he's

[02:08:09] crowded you know on the live
[02:08:11] stream so Lance tell us you you were the
[02:08:14] champ
[02:08:15] yesterday what happened
[02:08:17] today um
[02:08:19] yeah a few things uh okay so the first
[02:08:22] one uh the uh we had to recall something
[02:08:27] from yesterday which which is a by the
[02:08:31] way a very interesting and good surprise
[02:08:34] event I really really like I know it
[02:08:36] would made people uncomfortable and it's
[02:08:38] nothing everybody was uncomfortable but
[02:08:40] I I was surprised how well you did and
[02:08:41] you had a lot I think you were just off
[02:08:43] by one yeah for 021 I I guess I typed 01
[02:08:48] yeah so then everything else but how
[02:08:51] many do you think you would have gotten
[02:08:52] right otherwise really okay what did you
[02:08:55] I think you did like 60 or 70 61 yeah
[02:08:57] yeah yeah okay okay and then for the
[02:09:00] second one um it was just I mean
[02:09:05] everybody else thought it was clear it
[02:09:07] but it was some something the way you
[02:09:09] said like that that like okay you're
[02:09:12] about to do one of the three from
[02:09:15] yesterday of recalling from yesterday
[02:09:17] but I thought
[02:09:19] one of the three things we're going to
[02:09:20] do right
[02:09:22] now gotcha so uh after that first one I
[02:09:25] thought there were still two to go so I
[02:09:28] was I was uh you asked me to pick I said
[02:09:31] words so I was sitting there in my
[02:09:32] Palace thinking about the words from
[02:09:34] yesterday and then a group of words come
[02:09:36] up um and uh I just a technical problem
[02:09:40] there didn't understand no it wasn't
[02:09:42] technical no I'm talking about what's
[02:09:44] happening now they seem to have canceled
[02:09:45] those matches that were about to start
[02:09:47] did they show the items or did they
[02:09:48] cancel it before I think they're still
[02:09:49] there they canceled it before that oh
[02:09:51] all right I think they were just about
[02:09:53] in the Prem memorization period but okay
[02:09:55] never mind sorry car on that yeah okay
[02:09:58] um third one uh Marlo's Marlo's good at
[02:10:03] cards uh you've you got to go we both
[02:10:06] we're both good at cards we both have to
[02:10:08] go f you went for 23 seconds right yeah
[02:10:11] I think you had to versus right yeah so
[02:10:15] um and I SWA two images right it happens
[02:10:19] but that was kind of sad see that right
[02:10:21] there the Twitter she said you broke
[02:10:22] world record what who it was from
[02:10:26] yesterday the greatest
[02:10:28] confusion um the greatest all right and
[02:10:31] then lastly there was that you know his
[02:10:35] uh Marlo's images didn't one of his
[02:10:38] images didn't show up so you know he was
[02:10:40] like like hey there's an error and then
[02:10:42] I did mine and then y'all gave me the
[02:10:43] option you can keep yours and you know I
[02:10:46] did get them all right but
[02:10:48] 23 is I mean it I I don't know it's it's
[02:10:53] not excellent um so I I uh asked y'all
[02:10:58] said well you want to keep that score or
[02:11:00] do it over again sure I asked uh well
[02:11:04] can I look at his scores from yesterday
[02:11:06] so so I can see everybody seemed to
[02:11:08] think that was that was really unfair I
[02:11:11] I I really don't but um that's a good I
[02:11:14] mean we haven't thought about that
[02:11:15] before the thing is no matter what
[02:11:18] because of that kind of uh situation um
[02:11:22] he he sort of is going to have a small
[02:11:25] advantage in the fact that I either have
[02:11:27] to do it again even though I did it
[02:11:28] right or uh or he knows right the score
[02:11:32] to beat just so you know detecting that
[02:11:36] uh he he did a a very good sportsmanlike
[02:11:40] thing and and tried to even the playing
[02:11:42] field by by saying uh I'll tell you I'll
[02:11:44] tell you what my scores were yesterday
[02:11:46] uh he told me I asked him what was his
[02:11:48] best in practice he told me yeah um and
[02:11:51] it was it was right on the line I could
[02:11:53] have kept kept it or okay but then we
[02:11:56] went uh back and what happened is
[02:12:01] uh how would you describe a surprise
[02:12:04] event someone who doesn't know what it
[02:12:05] is yeah it's it's a surprise I mean how
[02:12:07] is it a surprise you guys
[02:12:09] know the the rest of the tournament you
[02:12:12] know what you're going to memorize it's
[02:12:13] what you train right so obviously you're
[02:12:15] comfortable it's it's I mean it's still
[02:12:18] difficult and you don't know who you're
[02:12:20] playing necessarily sometimes and that
[02:12:22] can be difficult but at least you know
[02:12:24] you're comfortable within your events
[02:12:25] you know what you can do the surprise
[02:12:27] events is something that could be
[02:12:29] anything honestly really could be
[02:12:30] anything so um it really pushes a lot of
[02:12:33] these memory athletes uh to places that
[02:12:35] they don't normally get the chance to go
[02:12:37] um and it tests their train skills in
[02:12:39] other ways and even if it's uh like it
[02:12:42] can even be a variation on the regular
[02:12:44] kinds of things we do like the digital
[02:12:46] exactly but it would be something we'd
[02:12:47] never done before yeah in a way yeah
[02:12:49] such as reshuffling the exact same 30
[02:12:52] images and memorizing them
[02:12:56] again that would be a good one yeah yeah
[02:12:59] that's what happened confusing yeah yeah
[02:13:02] I I
[02:13:03] uh man I wish I would have known that
[02:13:07] there would be the same
[02:13:09] images cuz it's it's like a well you've
[02:13:13] done images you practiced it like a
[02:13:15] thousand times well this is going to be
[02:13:17] unlike getting it those that's true yeah
[02:13:20] look at johanes he he really looks
[02:13:22] confident here with this 36 seconds he
[02:13:25] really want that I doubt I could have
[02:13:27] gotten got four to make up to make up
[02:13:30] for that four I need four in a row but I
[02:13:33] I wish I would in the future we have to
[02:13:35] stress that if something is off people
[02:13:37] have to raise their hands immediately
[02:13:39] and then we redo it but if if you're or
[02:13:42] if the discipline they're going to do is
[02:13:43] something they haven't done before you
[02:13:46] got to make sure to tell them that also
[02:13:48] right yeah
[02:13:50] yeah and bis is going in the lead here
[02:13:53] he needs every win now I'm pretty sad
[02:14:11] Ben than me say what can I do except you
[02:14:14] know work hard get better true true
[02:14:16] yesterday so here Boris here is fighting
[02:14:19] for his life here um doing a really good
[02:14:22] job of Boris and Alex he one of his
[02:14:25] special teas the words he was the world
[02:14:28] record holder in that discipline for for
[02:14:29] a while that's right he still has
[02:14:32] several World Records which are kind of
[02:14:34] out of memory
[02:14:35] Sports s of course also chose words just
[02:14:39] as we were speculating what he could
[02:14:41] choose he has to win something against
[02:14:43] Alex he's got 49 he nearly he nearly got
[02:14:48] the full thing there yesterday after the
[02:14:51] uh Boris and I were were in the same
[02:14:53] group and then after the 12th match I
[02:14:56] was two points ahead of him and it was
[02:15:00] words and names versus Boris those are
[02:15:03] like the two things that that when
[02:15:05] you're like working out your odds you
[02:15:07] give those to Boris Boris
[02:15:10] going on the live stream right now I
[02:15:13] think it's the first time I see that on
[02:15:14] our live streaming today it's really
[02:15:16] really nice to see all four tables all
[02:15:19] eight competitors at the same time we
[02:15:21] have a similar possibility on the
[02:15:22] websites somehow that was at Le last
[02:15:25] year yeah but I think now we split it up
[02:15:27] this way no it's also a nice way you can
[02:15:30] then choose just quickly back and forth
[02:15:32] but here we can see all of them at the
[02:15:33] same time one minute to
[02:15:36] go close to it but look at this P has
[02:15:39] [Music]
[02:15:41] 41 if he can just fill a few of those
[02:15:43] gaps he might even catch up yeah exactly
[02:15:45] and he stopped the clock just slightly
[02:15:46] before Boris so he's just F off Johan
[02:15:49] has pretty much secured his his point to
[02:15:51] draw even with
[02:15:53] [Music]
[02:15:54] Yan is short to being thrown out of the
[02:15:58] competition now I think yes I think Alex
[02:16:01] is just him Marvin and Christian are
[02:16:04] head-to-head with 30
[02:16:06] if no Christian has done a perfect 30 in
[02:16:09] a very good time so they've tied it up
[02:16:11] at the bottom there table three and four
[02:16:13] now at 22 Yeah so so johanes versus Yan
[02:16:17] versus Christian will be super hot run
[02:16:21] here while um s seems to drop out now
[02:16:25] and Boris is staying alive keep up the
[02:16:29] torch and Y continues to try to win
[02:16:33] every match now and here he
[02:16:35] is and he's been very subdued in his
[02:16:39] celebrations and
[02:16:41] disappointing there was just one time
[02:16:43] yesterday when he kicked his chair
[02:16:44] across the and scen yeah
[02:16:50] Facebook he yelled a uh you know
[02:16:53] explicit ter it's funny it was hilarious
[02:16:57] okay so sang is is s out of the game now
[02:17:00] is out is out okay that's Alex now being
[02:17:04] moving into the quarterfinals he'll play
[02:17:06] the winner of Boris versus puj and now
[02:17:10] in the other two matches we have ties so
[02:17:12] they'll have at least two more three
[02:17:15] four more matches and we
[02:17:19] Simon versus ktie isn't that another
[02:17:20] rematch from last year in that's right
[02:17:23] that is going to be so close because
[02:17:27] Katie is the established as the world's
[02:17:29] best at names and words now I think and
[02:17:31] seon does not like that because he very
[02:17:34] much wants to be the world's best yeah
[02:17:36] and he was he was I think I last year I
[02:17:38] posted something on my blog saying KY is
[02:17:40] even better than ah sorry I'm sorry
[02:17:43] everybody I posted something in my blog
[02:17:45] saying K Katie is even better than C he
[02:17:46] came to me the next next day and said
[02:17:48] what did you say this on your blog po
[02:17:49] this is true I think I have just as much
[02:17:51] chance
[02:17:53] as I've got some I've got some a great
[02:17:56] little audio clip here a little
[02:17:58] 10-second clip as I hope it goes through
[02:18:00] to the microphone but uh that you know
[02:18:03] let's hope it does so this is uh
[02:18:05] whenever they
[02:18:07] announced that uh I had just uh broken
[02:18:11] boris's world record here and you get to
[02:18:13] uh hear his his reaction to
[02:18:16] that
[02:18:18] let's see
[02:18:31] here that was uh the f word there
[02:18:34] actually we allowed to say that we
[02:18:37] allowed to say that here well Max said
[02:18:39] we allowed to say anything
[02:18:44] so yeah I I guess I guess if Bor really
[02:18:48] is winning this we will hear some
[02:18:51] incredibly
[02:18:52] Outburst but if he's losing that as well
[02:18:55] I mean on the other hand he's so far
[02:18:58] behind that I think if he's now losing
[02:19:00] it's probably not the not not really the
[02:19:04] super famous Outburst that that he will
[02:19:06] do that if he's getting closer to
[02:19:08] winning and then he's losing we will
[02:19:11] heard more of him so last year when he
[02:19:13] was beating seon it was just amazing I
[02:19:16] watch movie over and over again on
[02:19:19] YouTube yeah uh we had I think you made
[02:19:21] a you had one and I had one of that
[02:19:23] that's that's really good we had a
[02:19:25] close-up shot cuz we had some people
[02:19:27] filming when uh Simon First lost and
[02:19:30] then Simon and Boris like flew over
[02:19:32] there like screaming with excitement and
[02:19:34] we just had a close-up shot of Simon's
[02:19:36] face where I didn't use it in the video
[02:19:38] but he's just like so embarrassed
[02:19:41] annoyed all these other things that he
[02:19:44] lost that match he was upset I'm going
[02:19:45] to head back you guys all right
[02:19:50] enjoy thanks so much Nelson I love these
[02:19:53] new guests we have
[02:19:54] Lance we should we take C the
[02:19:56] commentators out we don't we go everyone
[02:20:00] can see my light
[02:20:01] pants take a look this is what I'm
[02:20:03] wearing today you Hugo Boss
[02:20:07] jacket is it say something else here R
[02:20:11] say and then ready yeah all right you
[02:20:14] you put that in hug go yep yep this is
[02:20:16] uh my brother created these shirts he
[02:20:18] cre that's really cool I really like
[02:20:20] these shirts are fantastic So Soft I
[02:20:23] love them yeah it's great I guess is
[02:20:25] that uh the logo they put on the metal
[02:20:30] yeah yeah that's really cool yeah he's
[02:20:33] he's great and this is part of not a
[02:20:35] billionaire production company the logo
[02:20:39] so
[02:20:40] yeah so let's let's let's have a look at
[02:20:43] the overview where are we at johanes yja
[02:20:46] 2 to Marvin Christian 22 so this is
[02:20:50] really really exciting what's going on
[02:20:52] there but also pfia versus Boris at the
[02:20:56] moment is my favorite matching because
[02:20:58] Boris has really the chance to to do
[02:21:01] that but he needs all his concentration
[02:21:04] and power and but he's he really must he
[02:21:07] really must try to calm himself down
[02:21:09] because this is so counterproductive
[02:21:11] yeah if you are if you are nervous and
[02:21:14] hard stressed exactly that's that's
[02:21:17] you're uh and you can bigger enemy even
[02:21:20] than your opponent if you're too
[02:21:22] stressed it's it's just almost
[02:21:23] impossible and look at Pia he is so
[02:21:26] relaxed and cool but Florian look so if
[02:21:29] he comes back and wins this you know who
[02:21:31] he's facing Alex so he's going to be
[02:21:34] exhausted if he makes his comeback right
[02:21:37] no I mean to be honest I I know bar is
[02:21:39] not for so long and we are Germans and
[02:21:41] friends and we do the memory Sports show
[02:21:43] together and everything but I'm always
[02:21:45] for the underdog and that means that
[02:21:48] um I really I really um think that PF
[02:21:52] can pull this off he can pull this off
[02:21:54] easily he's in the lead he's cool he's
[02:21:56] relaxed I'm picking Boris he's he's he's
[02:21:58] got the comeback been here for years he
[02:22:00] can do it I I really don't want to pick
[02:22:02] sides here but I think that Coria really
[02:22:04] has the upper hand at the moment he's
[02:22:06] chosen numbers for this event and I
[02:22:08] really think he might end up beating
[02:22:09] Boris on this he might be trying for a
[02:22:11] fast
[02:22:12] time and I love these other matches too
[02:22:15] both tied up 2-2 that's incredible
[02:22:17] yeah Christian came back look at this I
[02:22:20] very interesting yeah he doesn't like
[02:22:21] him split up Boris splits the six digits
[02:22:24] and Pia puts them together so uh they
[02:22:27] have basically kind of the same
[02:22:29] technique but they look at these fidgets
[02:22:31] slightly different I find it easier to
[02:22:33] do it like Boris where you have this
[02:22:34] little Gap in between to separate them
[02:22:37] find it harder to to see it when these
[02:22:39] six digits are directly next to each
[02:22:41] other what is the legend thing actually
[02:22:43] I heard he has a million objects his
[02:22:45] them a million but I
[02:22:48] think has a Pio system so technically
[02:22:51] has a 222 system there I'm surprised he
[02:22:54] doesn't split it into 22 to though
[02:22:57] personally I like to just have three on
[02:22:58] a screen at a
[02:22:59] Time It's Different Strokes for
[02:23:01] different and johanes did the images in
[02:23:03] 17.49 seconds as far as I know this is
[02:23:06] an incredibly fast time but it's not the
[02:23:08] record it's not the record but for him
[02:23:10] it's um pretty much as fast as I have
[02:23:13] seen him going so far I haven't really
[02:23:15] seen him fast faster or do you guys want
[02:23:19] to correct me there no it's as fastest
[02:23:21] yeah it's fast it's pretty fast for for
[02:23:24] a you know a day two kind of thing yeah
[02:23:27] exactly why do we see so many fast times
[02:23:30] today on day two Katie even broke her
[02:23:32] world record in words last year we
[02:23:34] didn't have that people were taking it
[02:23:36] much more secure on day two is that
[02:23:39] weird for pvj to start from the
[02:23:41] beginning cuz I see everyone else
[02:23:42] starting from the bottom well most
[02:23:44] people like to just look at the last
[02:23:46] couple of images and keep them in short
[02:23:47] look at Pia have typing in all these
[02:23:49] digits he has three rows out of four and
[02:23:51] he's typing faster faster faster
[02:23:53] everything is correct oh the first no he
[02:23:55] corrected it he corrected it and just
[02:23:58] okay corrected it and he's done that's
[02:24:00] that's it Boris Boris is out of the I've
[02:24:02] never been able to type all my digits in
[02:24:05] under 40 seconds I've started working
[02:24:07] with the the uh home Keys like or the uh
[02:24:11] number row but people say I type fast I
[02:24:13] use my own I use my own laptop which has
[02:24:15] a little number box oh I'm I'm an
[02:24:18] accountant I spend a lot of my life
[02:24:19] typing in numbers with the right hand
[02:24:21] just like that so so so Mongolia is just
[02:24:24] moving his second athlete into the final
[02:24:28] rounds there wow I can't wait to see
[02:24:30] boris's reaction to this this is the
[02:24:32] first it's not very nice but yeah not
[02:24:35] well it's not nice but I can't wait to
[02:24:36] say it's it's He's the bad boy of the
[02:24:38] memory yeah yeah it's strange cuz he's
[02:24:41] so calm and reserved most of the time
[02:24:42] it's just when he sits down at memory
[02:24:44] competitions and he's a bloody PhD in
[02:24:46] neuroscience
[02:24:48] oh and don't forget the extreme memory
[02:24:49] challenge folks extreme memory
[02:24:52] challenge.com go to it remember extreme
[02:24:54] memory challenge.com only takes 5 to 10
[02:24:56] minutes to take the
[02:24:59] test we have two minutes left in the
[02:25:02] recall J is just check out now Boris is
[02:25:05] still striving for his remaining digits
[02:25:07] but whether he gets them or not he will
[02:25:09] be out of the game as bre changing to be
[02:25:11] mind and and and Pui is already leaning
[02:25:15] back he looks very very confident he
[02:25:17] retyped these digits incredibly fast
[02:25:20] wait look at about a minutes oh Han has
[02:25:23] got his images H got his images that
[02:25:25] puts him into a 3 to2 lead in his on his
[02:25:29] table isn't it and Marvin's at 42 is at
[02:25:33] is well but there're still recalling
[02:25:35] here so nothing is really set in stone
[02:25:37] there yet look at this all these
[02:25:39] Graphics great
[02:25:41] job great job neck yeah I really like
[02:25:45] this view where you see all these tables
[02:25:47] now on the live stream if you could show
[02:25:48] our faces too yeah actually we can show
[02:25:50] our faces too exctly there's room on the
[02:25:52] top every time we get to see floring on
[02:25:53] camera it's just a joy all right
[02:25:56] Marvin's got the whole 52 so that will
[02:25:58] take him 3-2 up against
[02:26:00] Christian we have a little over a minute
[02:26:03] left in the
[02:26:05] recall well yep marwin just won this
[02:26:11] is we should we should see the camera on
[02:26:13] the top left with Boris yeah let's let's
[02:26:16] focus on
[02:26:18] Boris mean but let's see Boris it will
[02:26:20] it will throw him out of the competition
[02:26:22] but kind of oh really unfortunately his
[02:26:25] last game he will be out unfortunately B
[02:26:27] bis must already know that he's lost
[02:26:29] because he's only failed in 74 numbers
[02:26:31] must know there's a pretty good chance
[02:26:33] that P has got it already so perhaps he
[02:26:35] won't react quite as extremely as if
[02:26:37] yeah this is he thought there was still
[02:26:38] a chance I much prefer having missing
[02:26:41] six numbers than uh missing three but
[02:26:44] you know what Boris Boris goes home goes
[02:26:46] home with ,500 the thing is he since he
[02:26:49] still has gaps he kind of anticipates
[02:26:51] that he's going to lose this one
[02:26:55] and it would be better if he has
[02:26:57] all then he could calculate chance there
[02:27:02] and the outb even stronger why do we why
[02:27:05] do we count on this Outburst kind of
[02:27:06] mean there well that's what I said it's
[02:27:09] good spectator yeah
[02:27:11] yeah yep he knows it it's over it's just
[02:27:14] resignation from he already giving up
[02:27:18] there exactly he he's not going to be
[02:27:20] shocked about it that's thing exactly
[02:27:21] he's not shocked here we go he accepts
[02:27:24] us it's complete yeah wow well
[02:27:28] done oh no come on Boris give us a
[02:27:33] show what is this but well done prep
[02:27:36] well done team we're going to bring
[02:27:37] Boris in here we have amazing want we go
[02:27:40] grab yes let' be awesome thank
[02:27:42] you Pui I mean honestly Pui is doing
[02:27:45] such a great job he won all these Junior
[02:27:48] Championships he won one thing after
[02:27:51] another and now he really proves himself
[02:27:53] being one of the very best in the world
[02:27:56] this is amazing you know what he's going
[02:27:58] up against Alex Mullen the defending
[02:27:59] Champion so
[02:28:01] Alex Champion he's just brushed aside s
[02:28:05] who is perhaps the top Mongolian he's
[02:28:07] sort of the if anything the leader of
[02:28:09] the Mongolian team here so
[02:28:12] Al I see what I see in the skill of
[02:28:15] pafia I think he is
[02:28:17] he already said um he was already on par
[02:28:20] with s and he just he wasn't just as
[02:28:22] Lucky in the Championships before and I
[02:28:24] think he has trained super hard for this
[02:28:26] he looks so confident and he is and he
[02:28:28] is now in the quarterfinals and sang is
[02:28:31] not uh I think we will see more of him
[02:28:34] in the future yeah well po because he
[02:28:35] just nly missed out on qualification for
[02:28:38] the xmt last year I think he was number
[02:28:40] 17 out of the 16 qualifi so he didn't
[02:28:43] quite make it so I think that's given
[02:28:44] him the extra impetus to get better and
[02:28:46] better and now really make a sharing
[02:28:47] this time with Johannes and janra who
[02:28:50] gets a pick the next round next event
[02:28:53] now you're asking that's a good question
[02:28:55] joh was we have to remember who who won
[02:28:58] the surprise task and who chose the yeah
[02:29:00] the surprise task went winning it wasn't
[02:29:03] she surprise one hey there's Boris come
[02:29:05] on Boris Boris wellage I've been sitting
[02:29:09] down for a while come on please thank
[02:29:11] you we were already speculating whether
[02:29:13] you were shouting or not but then we
[02:29:15] anticipating that you will not because
[02:29:16] were seeing that you had some some gaps
[02:29:19] there and was it a surprise you could do
[02:29:21] the math yourself uh to you did you know
[02:29:23] this is going to be a big fight between
[02:29:24] I knew you want to be a big fight um the
[02:29:27] surprise task surprised me like in the
[02:29:29] past I've always been really good with
[02:29:30] these but um yeah and I got just not the
[02:29:35] luck I got last year last year I got
[02:29:37] lucky a lot of times and it went to the
[02:29:38] final and know it was one digit off like
[02:29:40] in the stair like if I guessed one digit
[02:29:43] better or remembered one image more um I
[02:29:45] would have gotten that point and then
[02:29:47] again um similar in the images um I felt
[02:29:50] really good 20 seconds is normally a
[02:29:52] time I can do well in but then suddenly
[02:29:54] there was the airplanes and the beach
[02:29:56] and I thought the air planes are over
[02:29:58] the beach but I didn't know the audio to
[02:30:00] do images anymore and then I put them
[02:30:02] correct first but then it felt really
[02:30:04] wrong and said no no no there must be
[02:30:05] the beach first because the this is a
[02:30:06] nice match here do we have this up here
[02:30:09] this is good y between janja and
[02:30:12] Johannes a cards
[02:30:15] event like they similar speed jra's a
[02:30:18] little bit
[02:30:20] faster and she
[02:30:23] is oh no she's going it
[02:30:27] again she's reviewing she's going to
[02:30:29] probably take all 60 seconds what is
[02:30:33] Johan in 38.1 seconds he has that
[02:30:35] Advantage right now yeah and it's it's a
[02:30:38] very secure time for him as well
[02:30:41] so he might and marwin and Christian are
[02:30:44] taking their time in words so this is
[02:30:46] this might might be the last event for
[02:30:47] for johannas how is the table with
[02:30:49] Marvin Christian Marvin is in the lead
[02:30:51] right no it's yes yeah he's lead three
[02:30:54] so so if Marvin is winning he comes into
[02:30:57] the quarterfinals if yanas is winning he
[02:30:59] recall starts in three two and one but
[02:31:03] look at this table four with Marvin and
[02:31:04] Christian both of them have 60 seconds
[02:31:06] so it's really all up to the amount of
[02:31:09] words that they get there because I'm
[02:31:11] looking at both of my teammates here I
[02:31:13] hope they do better than I do and can
[02:31:15] stay in the game where it should be
[02:31:18] little Advantage for Christian are you
[02:31:19] voting for the Germans of
[02:31:22] course I was voting for myself mostly
[02:31:24] but uh sadly that's over already yeah I
[02:31:27] will be kicked out of the German team
[02:31:29] because I I didn't do any predictions in
[02:31:31] that directions oh no that's not how you
[02:31:33] can everyone should predict what they
[02:31:35] said and you want to get out of here and
[02:31:37] get
[02:31:38] drunk later today later today first I
[02:31:40] want to see what the others do okay yeah
[02:31:43] I just got unlucky like Pro did a really
[02:31:46] great job so um it will be exciting to
[02:31:48] see how Alex can deal with them because
[02:31:50] I think he's a strong competitor he also
[02:31:52] had a good strategy like let me go fast
[02:31:54] in the carts and didn't try to to go
[02:31:56] even faster and now what do you guys
[02:31:59] make of wearing
[02:32:00] sunglasses and the headset like blocking
[02:32:03] everything out like visual for me it
[02:32:06] disturbs me more than it helps so I
[02:32:08] don't do that I tried it only a few
[02:32:09] times but I use ear plugs so maybe you
[02:32:11] don't see them as much as the headphones
[02:32:13] but they have the same effect so um
[02:32:15] they're nowadays really quality ear
[02:32:16] plugs really cheap which go in really
[02:32:18] well and really block out a lot of noise
[02:32:20] and that helps concentration a lot and
[02:32:22] you don't use anything not even I I do
[02:32:25] use uh earplugs M
[02:32:28] um and you know I take off my shoes and
[02:32:30] set Indian style on my chair that's
[02:32:32] that's what I do whenever I'm doing the
[02:32:34] like not just regular practice but as if
[02:32:37] I'm at The X xmt practice and the reason
[02:32:40] that I I agree with him totally about
[02:32:42] it's more distracting is because uh I
[02:32:45] don't wear goggles usually I don't do
[02:32:47] that um so you don't think it's it's
[02:32:50] cool to have all these gadgets on
[02:32:53] cool super
[02:32:55] cool I'm just not I'm just not that cool
[02:32:58] oh look at this what's going on there
[02:32:59] with johanes and JRA both of them like
[02:33:01] completely screwing up their results I
[02:33:03] think it's just they just they're going
[02:33:05] to shift it has his techic where he
[02:33:07] maybe doesn't know he's missing
[02:33:08] something there but Marin's and his
[02:33:10] parts are correct if you look at this
[02:33:12] he's just off by one location he's going
[02:33:14] to see that right now yeah it looks like
[02:33:16] marn's going to the next round we still
[02:33:18] have a minute
[02:33:21] 45 J's also just off by one cards both
[02:33:24] of them might shift in there she is she
[02:33:27] already shifted half of their incorrect
[02:33:29] cards and the way she has that King it's
[02:33:32] an sometimes it's not you have to click
[02:33:35] it'd be nice if you could kind of like
[02:33:36] control click and then shift so
[02:33:40] you corre well he's moving on to the
[02:33:43] next
[02:33:45] roundr still typing so the defending
[02:33:47] Champion is still defending Champion is
[02:33:49] still in and the previous Champion is
[02:33:52] also still in with Shon Reinhard and it
[02:33:54] was all right
[02:33:58] um and the next Champion is also still
[02:34:00] that's
[02:34:03] no that's a good one Boris minute left
[02:34:06] in the recall Marvin is in the leag with
[02:34:08] 33 Words which will put him into the
[02:34:11] quarterfinals if he can keep it up but
[02:34:13] Chris still going
[02:34:16] yet and they're just very close to each
[02:34:19] other Christian just switched up a
[02:34:20] couple of names in 44 and
[02:34:26] 45 here we go so close maybe you can get
[02:34:29] a um the other camera on Marvin and
[02:34:32] Christian as well there on the top on
[02:34:34] the top right got a table four y perfect
[02:34:36] we technically have four cameras
[02:34:39] here no
[02:34:41] it's oh oops tied
[02:34:45] up gets in
[02:34:48] leete but just by one word just by one
[02:34:51] word don't it's all you need Mar might
[02:34:53] 10 seconds here we go get that oh
[02:34:56] doesn't look good for Marvin Christian
[02:34:58] will be shocked that he didn't get
[02:35:01] more and oh he got one more though
[02:35:05] solidifies and here we go
[02:35:08] Christian on fire makes it we're going
[02:35:10] to game seven johanes is in the
[02:35:13] quarterfinals that leaves us one table
[02:35:15] Christian against
[02:35:19] Marvin both of them really must feel the
[02:35:23] pressure
[02:35:24] now what's the next event they're the
[02:35:27] only ones in the room now still
[02:35:29] competing it's like oh my God come on
[02:35:31] let's see who chooses the next event it
[02:35:34] is can you see that there in the so the
[02:35:36] surprise one yeah Marin is choosing so
[02:35:39] that's a big Advantage what's his
[02:35:40] Advantage look at this how they're going
[02:35:42] back forth back forth back forth back
[02:35:44] forth this is incredible it's numbers I
[02:35:48] guess your prediction could be wrong my
[02:35:50] prediction already I mean yeah I well I
[02:35:54] put this guy on number two look at all
[02:35:55] these guys here all our
[02:35:57] competitors incredible guys thank you
[02:35:59] for that by the I'm sorry I wasn't I
[02:36:01] already I already went in that direction
[02:36:02] I didn't want to stop there and leave it
[02:36:04] the awkward elephant in the room so
[02:36:05] remember that time when two Germans two
[02:36:07] Germans a guy from the US and a British
[02:36:10] guy walked into a
[02:36:12] room I have no idea where I'm going with
[02:36:14] that
[02:36:17] silence I didn't know you had that kind
[02:36:19] of joke in Britain we say an Englishman
[02:36:21] and Irishman and a Scotsman went into a
[02:36:22] bar what do you say in am all they're
[02:36:25] all kinds a a rabbi a priest and a uh I
[02:36:30] don't know which doctor where you from
[02:36:32] all these all these guys all these joks
[02:36:34] are kind of racist aren they oh yes I
[02:36:37] say I'm from Austin which is close to
[02:36:39] True okay yeah from Austin Texas mhm so
[02:36:43] what do we see here
[02:36:44] numbers
[02:36:46] the pick
[02:36:49] numbers here we see
[02:36:52] Marvin who has
[02:36:55] already had that huge shock last year at
[02:36:57] the world memory Championship where he
[02:36:59] was in the lead for nine disciplines and
[02:37:01] then in the last moment
[02:37:03] Alex Christian set him up last year
[02:37:05] there's a lot of new faces today round
[02:37:07] of 16 matches last year oh they they
[02:37:09] were had to head against each other beat
[02:37:11] Marvin 43 and that one or 42 so so this
[02:37:14] one is when comes down to something like
[02:37:16] this it's who can cope with the pressure
[02:37:18] best I think Marvin has the best times
[02:37:19] on paper when it comes to numbers but
[02:37:22] it's just who has the head in the right
[02:37:24] place I don't know I like I like
[02:37:25] Christian style wow look at the all that
[02:37:30] marwin what's he doing nine digits yeah
[02:37:33] it's lagging a little bit so we don't
[02:37:35] know yeah he does a three prus just like
[02:37:38] Ben it's that's what uh that's what Alex
[02:37:41] and I did also for a long time but both
[02:37:44] of us re he he switched first made a lot
[02:37:47] of progress and said that he thinks
[02:37:49] that's why Christian didn't want to take
[02:37:51] the risk to push a button so he's
[02:37:52] reviewing let's see if Marvin he's
[02:37:54] probably sensible he's relying on Marvin
[02:37:56] making a mistake Marvin has a fast time
[02:37:58] but not like incredibly fast he probably
[02:38:01] can't do faster than that
[02:38:04] so I would I
[02:38:06] would probably say there was
[02:38:10] like time yeah but he only saw them once
[02:38:13] like there's still like Risk when you
[02:38:14] only see them once that you saw
[02:38:15] something wrong or a glitch there like
[02:38:19] yeah exactly so Christian will be very
[02:38:21] secure it's it's likely that he will
[02:38:23] have everything correct there so it's
[02:38:26] all eyes are on Marvin
[02:38:28] here interesting that Christian stopped
[02:38:31] the time there he just happened to get
[02:38:33] to the end there I think you
[02:38:34] automatically pressed up I know I do
[02:38:36] anyway I've done it also dig like the
[02:38:39] digits at the end against uh in the
[02:38:41] words against P it turned blue and I
[02:38:43] just he was quite fast with 54 something
[02:38:46] seconds and I was in like 5 Second
[02:38:49] seconds and turn blue like yeah just go
[02:38:51] nice close closeup shot of the hands
[02:38:53] close up shot exactly um let see what
[02:38:55] they look
[02:39:01] at marwin is just Marin doesn't seem to
[02:39:04] have any problem at all there does he so
[02:39:06] far he's taking he's taking you jinxed
[02:39:08] him sorry I'm
[02:39:14] sorry
[02:39:16] yeah we had the 10c delay here between
[02:39:19] what happens on on the preview and on
[02:39:22] the um Life feed from the camera in the
[02:39:26] room so Christian Christian's done done
[02:39:30] no mistakes there so all eyes are on
[02:39:33] Marvin can he get it he's been sitting
[02:39:36] on that number for a while his his his
[02:39:39] style of memorizing which is way the
[02:39:41] same thing same way you do it right
[02:39:43] three digigit system three images on
[02:39:45] location yeah he found it it's how do
[02:39:48] you think how difficult it is if you
[02:39:50] have a gap to retrieve that with such a
[02:39:52] big system and how so many images on one
[02:39:55] location it is a I think he's got it he
[02:39:57] got it by George he has that's
[02:40:00] it on finals and my prediction still is
[02:40:04] alive let's see if he decides to change
[02:40:08] something it has happened before it has
[02:40:11] it's happened to me here I think we all
[02:40:14] have our story of when that's happened I
[02:40:15] just dided this match against P images I
[02:40:17] had it all correct and then I decided to
[02:40:19] switch it was it was so it was so
[02:40:21] exciting early when I think it was
[02:40:22] johanes Sue against KT K they were they
[02:40:27] were on par and up down up down both of
[02:40:29] them changing see H against zon if we
[02:40:32] saw it in the back so there was um I
[02:40:35] think Yan hendrik and zon were equal on
[02:40:36] names and then for Simon deleted and
[02:40:40] then Simon put it back and then Henri
[02:40:41] deleted one so it was oh my
[02:40:44] God
[02:40:47] they're both just reviewing there less
[02:40:49] than two minutes I meant that Boris I
[02:40:51] think I meant that I think they're both
[02:40:52] happy now they've stopped they're just
[02:40:54] waiting for the time to and this is when
[02:40:56] the time really drags we've got one and
[02:40:57] a half minutes before you find out if
[02:40:59] you made a mistake or not I want to ask
[02:41:01] you Bor so what do you do at the max
[02:41:02] plank Institute oh not I left it two
[02:41:05] years ago I did my PhD there and now I'm
[02:41:06] at dunders Institute that's in the
[02:41:08] Netherlands I'm a post I do uh research
[02:41:11] on Superior memory so I actually studied
[02:41:13] a lot of some people competing here
[02:41:14] using different techniques different
[02:41:15] tasks and see um what's going on in
[02:41:18] their brains and if their brains are
[02:41:19] normal or if you need a specific brain
[02:41:21] hint you don't their brains are quite
[02:41:22] normal um yeah and and all all these
[02:41:25] things around that so it's really true
[02:41:27] that you don't need to be special to do
[02:41:29] this correct so if you look at a brain
[02:41:31] of a memory and compare it to someone
[02:41:32] else you don't see a difference if you
[02:41:34] just look at the brain structure gets a
[02:41:36] bit different in terms of connectivity
[02:41:38] by doing all the trainings we build up
[02:41:39] some Pathways in the brain or build them
[02:41:41] out that are not built out for for other
[02:41:43] people like between the visual Center
[02:41:45] because of all the visual techn
[02:41:47] techniques we use and and the frontal
[02:41:49] brain where attention sits for example
[02:41:52] um but in particular the main difference
[02:41:54] is what parts of the brain are active
[02:41:56] and the memory leet tries to remember
[02:41:58] because if someone who maybe doesn't
[02:41:59] know pneumonic techniques tries to
[02:42:01] members these numbers just very small
[02:42:03] networks will be active that are capable
[02:42:05] of storing numbers by itself but in the
[02:42:06] memory the whole visual cortex the whole
[02:42:08] visual memory system is is engaged and
[02:42:10] therefore they use a lot more of the
[02:42:12] different memory systems and by that are
[02:42:14] able to music performances you see here
[02:42:16] but the good news is anyone can learn
[02:42:18] that so it's actually true maybe not
[02:42:20] everyone can set a world record of
[02:42:21] course not but um for example to
[02:42:22] memorize 80 digit maybe not in a minute
[02:42:24] like these guys but in five minutes I
[02:42:26] certainly can teach everyone like I do
[02:42:28] that I'm also working as a Memory
[02:42:29] Trainer I did it with a German TV host a
[02:42:31] famous one but let's let's look at the
[02:42:33] reaction here we go and here we go
[02:42:35] Marvin is in the
[02:42:38] quarterfinals so cool wait a go wow no
[02:42:43] reaction completely not me
[02:42:47] yeah no exactly and he comes mavin's mom
[02:42:50] and she's so happy look at her giving
[02:42:52] him a little kiss on the cheek guys I'll
[02:42:54] leave you here I need something to drink
[02:42:56] see my friends but maybe I can jojin you
[02:42:58] back later cool we have many more
[02:43:00] questions about the
[02:43:02] brain you congratulate the Lan you're
[02:43:06] not allowed to leave no I'm just
[02:43:08] kidding conratulations to people too all
[02:43:11] right thank you I'll see you
[02:43:13] later so it's just us Marin's
[02:43:17] smiling that's incredible just us again
[02:43:20] look at that the the live stream
[02:43:22] commentating team is can we get a shot
[02:43:24] of Nick please our director and it
[02:43:28] man
[02:43:31] no there are the cameras going around
[02:43:34] through the room where we have all our
[02:43:36] Arbiters and Camera guys now look at the
[02:43:39] top right everyone go to extremem memory
[02:43:41] challenge.com once again extremem memory
[02:43:44] challenge.com
[02:43:45] 5 to 10 minute challenge just to test
[02:43:47] your brain and see where you are at and
[02:43:50] we want a million Challengers so please
[02:43:53] take the
[02:43:56] challenge yeah exactly wow well we are
[02:44:00] one step further into the xmt now the
[02:44:04] OCTA finals the round of 16 is now over
[02:44:08] we
[02:44:09] have um z z zoric b from Mongolia
[02:44:12] competing against Malo Knight we have
[02:44:15] Simon Reinhard from Germany against Katy
[02:44:17] kode from the UK we have Alex Mullen
[02:44:20] from the United States competing against
[02:44:21] Pia have Denis saan from Mongolia and we
[02:44:24] have Johannes Malo against Marvin bonus
[02:44:27] from Sweden so this makes two from
[02:44:31] Mongolia two from the United Kingdom we
[02:44:35] have two from Germany we have one from
[02:44:38] the United States and we have one from
[02:44:41] Sweden that's pretty exciting do you
[02:44:43] know what's actually going on know in
[02:44:45] terms of schedule do we have a break
[02:44:48] here yes we are now what what time is it
[02:44:53] actually umum we have well 111 12 here
[02:44:58] local time in
[02:45:00] California that puts that um so we
[02:45:04] should be starting
[02:45:05] soon we should be starting there's not
[02:45:08] four
[02:45:09] minutes yeah so so that's not really a
[02:45:12] big break here we are basically
[02:45:14] needlessly continuing here wow that was
[02:45:17] an exciting morning Max what do you
[02:45:18] think I thought there was an upset I was
[02:45:22] a little upset that Everett didn't
[02:45:24] finish it but you know true me too
[02:45:26] although I really I really think that um
[02:45:30] z z who did an
[02:45:32] extremely good job and I'm happy for her
[02:45:34] I'm happy for her and I'm happy for the
[02:45:36] entire Mongolian team because they are
[02:45:37] so they're so close they you can see by
[02:45:40] them messaging you and so excited but
[02:45:43] you know what the biggest upset of the
[02:45:46] day was Marlo beating Lance and it
[02:45:48] wasn't just by a little bit he beat him
[02:45:49] four
[02:45:50] nothing crushed him so Marlo and CCE
[02:45:54] that's the matchup I'm looking for in
[02:45:56] the next round I mean they all of them
[02:45:59] are incredible a lot of people picked
[02:46:01] marwin to win it all so you have marwin
[02:46:04] versus the defending xmt Champion Alex
[02:46:06] who's breaking all these records he's
[02:46:08] facing off off against pvv pvv and then
[02:46:12] Simon and Katie again
[02:46:16] especially since both of them are so
[02:46:19] similar in their Specialties except
[02:46:22] for except for the cards and numbers
[02:46:25] where I think Simon is slightly ahead of
[02:46:28] her and he knows that but Katie is now
[02:46:31] seems to be better in names and words
[02:46:36] than um Simon is although he was the
[02:46:40] word record holder of that for such a
[02:46:42] long time but ktie was really killing it
[02:46:44] with his with her
[02:46:47] continuously breaking the world record
[02:46:50] in words she did yesterday I think for
[02:46:53] the first time she was the one that did
[02:46:54] it in the the 50 words all together and
[02:46:58] then she immediately she didn't do that
[02:47:01] in 60 seconds but she did that in 55 and
[02:47:04] she went down to 53 and today she was
[02:47:07] going down to 51. 31 seconds now while
[02:47:11] you're do talking I'm going to do the
[02:47:13] extreme memory challenge you want to do
[02:47:15] the extreme Challenge right now right
[02:47:17] now all right so yeah the camera is in
[02:47:21] the room which is seems to be empty
[02:47:24] there all the athletes are trying to get
[02:47:26] some breath and um gather gather their
[02:47:33] memory in the meantime let's see
[02:47:37] um right well my when I look at when I
[02:47:40] look at the first
[02:47:42] round CC against Maro that's a tough one
[02:47:46] I mean both of them well Maro qualified
[02:47:50] on on the bottom end there yesterday for
[02:47:53] the for the finals so I can't really say
[02:47:57] who's who's in the lead there
[02:48:01] um I kind of think that Marlo might be a
[02:48:05] bit Superior in terms of CCE but CCE
[02:48:08] qualified so much better than heated so
[02:48:10] I don't know there would be that would
[02:48:12] be a very interesting thing going on
[02:48:14] Simon against ktie crazy I think
[02:48:18] Simon Simon really has to be smart about
[02:48:22] this because Katie I see Katie has some
[02:48:25] advantages in terms of names and words
[02:48:27] Alex versus Pia interesting most people
[02:48:30] would say Alex challenge most people
[02:48:33] would say Alex clearly is um the
[02:48:36] favorite out of that one but I'm not so
[02:48:38] sure about that um puj is doing an
[02:48:41] incredibly good job and I think he's
[02:48:44] certain
[02:48:45] certainly one of the best Juniors I have
[02:48:48] ever seen if not even the best Junior I
[02:48:50] have ever seen in memory Sports from all
[02:48:53] in all the years that I'm doing this now
[02:48:56] he is just killing it and he wins he
[02:48:58] wins against grownups you're not
[02:49:01] listening to me you m I am listening no
[02:49:03] no no no it's okay continue with the
[02:49:04] challenge this is extremely hard right
[02:49:06] now yeah do that and then Johannes
[02:49:09] versus Marvin well Johannes is one of my
[02:49:12] best
[02:49:13] friends um
[02:49:15] so it's so tough to say that for me but
[02:49:19] honestly I think it's good that we have
[02:49:21] all these new faces and
[02:49:22] Marvin Marvin really wants that and he
[02:49:26] probably really needs that to go to go
[02:49:29] on so and my my prediction was actually
[02:49:32] on Marvin so I I just want to I just
[02:49:34] want to shut up about this match my
[02:49:36] prediction is Marlo I'm sorry I think
[02:49:38] he's going to go all the way I think
[02:49:40] he's going to upset Mar Knight for for
[02:49:42] the for the win yeah he's going upset
[02:49:45] everyone well it would it would be a
[02:49:47] really cool thing to see absolutely I'm
[02:49:50] always I'm always with the underdog like
[02:49:52] I said and he was clearly the underlock
[02:49:54] because he was the last one to qualify
[02:49:55] yesterday and now he was destroying
[02:49:59] L and um we will see what's going on and
[02:50:03] he is very talented he is super fast he
[02:50:06] is the UK Champion he can memorize cards
[02:50:09] in 20 something 23 or something he did
[02:50:13] right nothing 20 something which is
[02:50:15] super fast will be super tough for for
[02:50:17] cc to do that I don't know what where he
[02:50:19] is with the images words and names
[02:50:21] actually but he's no decently skilled
[02:50:24] there I do want to tell everyone
[02:50:25] whoever's in this competition still wins
[02:50:27] money 17th through 24th they get
[02:50:30] $750 9th through 16th Place gets
[02:50:34] $1,500 5 through 8 gets $2,500 fourth
[02:50:37] place gets
[02:50:38] $5,000 third place gets
[02:50:41] $7,000 second place gets 10 grand in
[02:50:44] first place gets 15 grand and now if you
[02:50:47] beat a record yesterday you get $2,000
[02:50:50] so Katie took home $4,000 because she
[02:50:52] just crushed a couple records Lance had
[02:50:55] a record too so he takes home
[02:50:58] $2,750 so we don't feel that bad for him
[02:51:01] no obviously not he did a great job and
[02:51:03] he also again he proved the world what
[02:51:06] what an amazing memorizer he is he is so
[02:51:09] good he's so fast and honestly I think
[02:51:13] he is he is one the hottest candidate to
[02:51:15] become the best in the world sooner than
[02:51:18] later yeah he just he just need to work
[02:51:21] on really being concentrated and getting
[02:51:25] getting into this into this calm mood
[02:51:27] that many of the other athletes are
[02:51:29] showing he really needs that it um it
[02:51:32] was probably one of the things why he
[02:51:33] was losing today the first the first
[02:51:35] round was so shocking to him and then
[02:51:37] the second and everything that was like
[02:51:40] overwhelming you know what I not a lot
[02:51:42] of people talk about meditation I
[02:51:43] thought like that would be a big thing
[02:51:45] with memory athletes meditating and
[02:51:47] getting in the zone and really not
[02:51:49] thinking about other things agre I agree
[02:51:50] at at now I for now I think people are
[02:51:53] getting more and more into these kind of
[02:51:55] things the same for healthy um food the
[02:51:58] same for doing physical Sports to really
[02:52:01] keep your body um fit and enough enough
[02:52:05] oxygen in your brain Manana inum a good
[02:52:09] a
[02:52:10] healthy Manana incor you did seven years
[02:52:13] of Latin I never did Latin you never did
[02:52:16] Latin no um a healthy mind lives in a
[02:52:19] healthy body yep right the expression
[02:52:21] and it's true because the better you are
[02:52:24] at sport not the better but you should
[02:52:26] have at least a decent amount of
[02:52:28] physical sports activities to have
[02:52:31] sufficient oxygen in your blood in order
[02:52:34] to keep up that high level of um of
[02:52:39] thinking yep there's a hashtag right up
[02:52:41] above my head Ash xmt
[02:52:45] 2016 yeah you can use that for Twitter
[02:52:47] and for Facebook I have a prediction for
[02:52:49] a country that's going to be huge and
[02:52:51] incredible at the sport
[02:52:53] India India has the biggest championship
[02:52:56] in the world do they really they had I
[02:52:58] think I'm not actually sure if that's
[02:53:00] true because I never really checked that
[02:53:01] fact but I heard this one year they had
[02:53:03] like a thousand people registering for
[02:53:06] it and completely broke everything we
[02:53:09] also have India um applying now uh I'm
[02:53:13] not I'm not stuff I'm not sure if I'm
[02:53:16] supposed to say that but India has
[02:53:17] applied for our new world memory
[02:53:20] Championship they're going to be
[02:53:21] bringing meditation that that we want to
[02:53:22] do um Dr crany Raj um who is the uh Team
[02:53:28] the team leader and coach of of our
[02:53:30] fantastic Indian athletes he is really
[02:53:33] looking forward to do that Championship
[02:53:34] there and I think it would be a
[02:53:35] wonderful place what a marvelous country
[02:53:38] in hisory has um and the the Indian
[02:53:41] athletes are getting super strong and of
[02:53:43] course it's it will be the biggest
[02:53:45] country in the world sooner than later
[02:53:47] as well right now China has more
[02:53:49] population than India but India is kind
[02:53:52] of getting there so I have a question so
[02:53:54] you physically don't need a big head to
[02:53:56] be good at this
[02:53:58] far look look at the gender difference
[02:54:01] we already talked about this males have
[02:54:03] you're taking me
[02:54:04] seriously honestly it's an interesting
[02:54:07] technically an interesting thing because
[02:54:08] males have a heavier brain or a bigger
[02:54:11] brain than females but it doesn't mean
[02:54:13] anything it doesn't mean that they're
[02:54:14] smarter or whatever we see ktie here
[02:54:16] really crushing one male after another
[02:54:19] and um yeah so we don't have to have a
[02:54:23] cone head cone head remember extreme
[02:54:26] memory challenge it took me 5 minutes
[02:54:29] it's easy I beat Nelson did you get a
[02:54:32] result there no I didn't take it yet I
[02:54:34] was so distracted it's you really need a
[02:54:36] Focus right of course yeah and I was
[02:54:39] talking all the time and you probably
[02:54:42] want to do that silently yeah silent and
[02:54:44] not yeah no being distracted there all
[02:54:46] the time but look at this we have the
[02:54:48] Twitter feed up top we have the hashtag
[02:54:51] we have that beautiful xmt logo our
[02:54:53] names even though you cut off my name
[02:54:55] it's a beautiful last name burkwitz Max
[02:54:58] B and then right at the right corner
[02:55:00] over here extremem memory challenge.com
[02:55:04] right so we are now preparing for the
[02:55:07] next round the quar finals surprise
[02:55:09] event will be the first one we don't
[02:55:12] know what this is about it's a surprise
[02:55:14] we will hear very soon for the surprise

[02:55:27] yours is already hooked up that's fine
[02:55:28] but just use the computer on the table

[02:55:52] as easy and understandable as possible
[02:55:55] so you have the the rules down in front
[02:55:57] of you I'm going to explain them we have
[02:55:59] a little video that we're going to share
[02:56:01] so through the different ways hopefully

[02:56:05] do
[02:56:12] um so if everybody will watch I'm going
[02:56:14] to play a little video that describes
[02:56:16] what's happening and you'll see how it
[02:56:17] will unfold it's very short um and don't
[02:56:20] worry if there's questions the most
[02:56:22] important part of this videos are so you

[02:56:38] and images combo competitor prep time is
[02:56:41] 2 minutes data 30 cards cards and images
[02:56:45] 15 cards 15 images Shuffle memorization
[02:56:48] Time 1 minute recall Time 4 minutes
[02:56:52] scoring is plus one correct for every
[02:56:54] correctly placed item no penalty for an
[02:56:56] incorrectly placed item winner goes to

[02:57:36] here okay so as I said there'll be a
[02:57:40] twom minute prep time so once I'm done
[02:57:42] discussing this and everybody agrees
[02:57:44] that we understand you'll have 2 minutes
[02:57:46] to kind of figure out your strategy how
[02:57:48] you want to approach this once the two
[02:57:50] minutes are done we will start right so
[02:57:53] before we do the two-minute prep time I
[02:57:54] want to have us all click ready so we'll
[02:57:58] say two minutes are up and the
[02:58:00] 20 for the viewers it's 30 uh count
[02:58:03] minute prep time will begin second 30
[02:58:06] second right
[02:58:07] sorry um so yeah once the 2 minutes are
[02:58:10] over the 30 second Prem memorization
[02:58:12] countdown will begin on the software
[02:58:14] leading straight into the standard cards
[02:58:17] images event that we just showed recall
[02:58:19] is the same as in the images event so
[02:58:21] you'll have 30 images which are a
[02:58:23] combination of pictures and cards and
[02:58:26] there are 15 images like pictures and 15
[02:58:29] cards shuffled together um and during
[02:58:32] recall they will show at the bottom of
[02:58:33] the screen and must be dragged to the
[02:58:35] correct spot we're all familiar with
[02:58:37] that uh it is exactly like the images
[02:58:39] event except 15 of the quote unquote
[02:58:42] images are now random cards scoring is
[02:58:44] the same plus one for every correctly
[02:58:46] placed item no penalty for an
[02:58:49] incorrectly placed item and winner goes
[02:58:51] to the competitor with the highest score
[02:58:53] time is the Tie
[02:58:56] break so is everybody clear on
[02:59:00] that I need a yes from everybody and say
[02:59:03] ready on their uh
[02:59:06] screen so table one we're good table two

[00:00:16] worse this was a close battle between

=== XMT 2016 - Day 2 - Semi Finals ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDcPMIEpjeM

[00:00:00] EAS us a littleit yes he does no but
[00:00:02] honestly I think he's just really having
[00:00:04] this feeling of what's going on there I
[00:00:06] think this is where you think a lot
[00:00:08] more about what you're doing in
[00:00:10] semi-finals this is big this is a lot of
[00:00:12] money up for
[00:00:13] grabs
[00:00:24] sure just to say again so CeCe has seven
[00:00:29] mistakes that yeah that's and they're
[00:00:31] all like somewhere
[00:00:32] [Music]
[00:00:34] else um looks like she memorized those
[00:00:38] last five ones that she put into her
[00:00:40] probably into long shortterm memory
[00:00:43] incorrectly so the the last one should
[00:00:46] have been the first one of this block of
[00:00:48] five and she missed that what is that a
[00:00:50] Christmas come on CeCe we need a female
[00:00:53] in the finals let's go there you go nice
[00:00:57] okay she corrected that one technically
[00:00:59] she own only needs to move that one
[00:01:02] minute go what is that image that's a
[00:01:03] that's a mountain and she needs to put
[00:01:06] that mountain in the beginning of that
[00:01:07] block and move the other four Gara she
[00:01:10] can't do it Johannes just finished that
[00:01:13] um one remaining image now he needs to
[00:01:16] remember those Double Image there 80046
[00:01:24] 0946 now we're we're in the semi-finals
[00:01:26] there's 30 seconds left oh she switched
[00:01:29] it again n CC she had it correctly right
[00:01:32] but doesn't really make a difference
[00:01:33] because the block of fight
[00:01:35] down is still incorrect so CC and
[00:01:39] Johannes are struggling to finish let us
[00:01:42] let us switch to to Johannes because
[00:01:45] last 15 seconds that we have here he
[00:01:48] might come up with that but it doesn't
[00:01:50] look good put anything in joh he doesn't
[00:01:53] have even have to fingers on the
[00:01:54] keyboard put anything in just put some
[00:01:57] numbers yeah he's doing that now but
[00:02:00] doesn't help
[00:02:02] him actually gave him two points it
[00:02:05] could have actually made a difference if
[00:02:06] you if Pui would have not everything
[00:02:09] correct but Pui is now in the lead with
[00:02:11] three20 against the number one in the
[00:02:14] world this is amazing he's like
[00:02:18] destroying yanas there but hey last year
[00:02:22] he had his comeback so I don't think he
[00:02:25] wasn't down three nothing was he he was
[00:02:27] are you sure yes are you sure I'm pretty
[00:02:30] sure I'm pretty sure not I'm pretty no
[00:02:34] no I was I was there cuz three that's
[00:02:36] pretty big hi so o o that is I'm
[00:02:42] schvitzing here I need a sprit
[00:02:46] this is a good
[00:02:47] semi-finals Table Three look at this
[00:02:50] Simon is now just Simon is going the
[00:02:53] lead relax
[00:02:55] before game number four johanes really
[00:02:59] now needs pull himself together look and
[00:03:01] go crazy what is he doing with his hands
[00:03:04] he's placing things no no I think he's
[00:03:07] reviewing his Memory Palace that he's
[00:03:09] about to use now okay he's cleaning it
[00:03:11] out probably not cleaning it but just
[00:03:14] just refreshing it one more time
[00:03:17] to activate that create this electrical
[00:03:21] activity mhm and keep it fresh so that
[00:03:24] it will come more effortlessly although
[00:03:27] he probably doesn't need that in the
[00:03:28] first place who memory power would you
[00:03:30] like to get inside sounds kind of dirty
[00:03:34] but I think most memory pestes would be
[00:03:37] extremely boring really they're just
[00:03:39] apartments and Parks no no no and what
[00:03:43] do you what do you think like they have
[00:03:45] I feel like there's couple of murders
[00:03:47] and like sexual activity going on no no
[00:03:51] no that's just the Memory Palace itself
[00:03:53] is is an empty are empty locations but
[00:03:57] what they put inside it what they put
[00:03:58] inside is a different story that's what
[00:03:59] I'm saying you want to get inside there
[00:04:01] and right so you want to you want to see
[00:04:03] what images they create that's a
[00:04:05] completely different story of course
[00:04:06] that would be awesome if we could do
[00:04:07] that yeah I love how we can see all the
[00:04:10] other competitors that were in this
[00:04:11] event they're still here they're
[00:04:12] watching it they're excited they want to
[00:04:14] see the the new winner of xmt extreme
[00:04:18] memory tournament and look how cool
[00:04:20] Johannes looks with his glasses
[00:04:22] yesterday we were asking yourself why is
[00:04:23] he even doing that I mean honestly it
[00:04:25] looks so looks so awesome Sleek I
[00:04:30] I I easily I easily can say that yeah
[00:04:33] this is this is what it looks we're
[00:04:35] almost there we're almost to the
[00:04:39] finals one more day
[00:04:43] right honestly right
[00:04:45] now I I really wish that johanes is is
[00:04:48] getting a point there to to continue
[00:04:52] although I must say Pui really really
[00:04:55] really really really earned it yeah he
[00:04:57] did he he kicked ass he really
[00:05:00] did so what do we see here CC against
[00:05:03] Simon in numbers both of them head tohe
[00:05:06] head tohe Simon is they're both the same
[00:05:08] speed Pui wordss uh against Johannes and
[00:05:11] Johannes is taking it super slow super
[00:05:14] slow uh pooi but I mean both of them
[00:05:17] were used the entire time as we used to
[00:05:20] probably stopping a little bit earlier
[00:05:22] interestingly that yanas is taking
[00:05:24] longer to memorize that puji is like
[00:05:26] twice as fast he nearly is surrounded
[00:05:29] johanes before he came to the end so
[00:05:32] right now Pui is looking at the same
[00:05:34] world the second time where yannes is
[00:05:36] still looking at them for the first time
[00:05:38] so Johannes doesn't do a recall here
[00:05:42] that is dangerous in my opinion that
[00:05:45] he's not doing a Recon now he has only
[00:05:46] look look he just had a few seconds to
[00:05:49] had a second look first it's your method
[00:05:53] your style what a less than 60 seconds
[00:05:57] just press it 58 59 there you go
[00:05:59] actually actually my style is even
[00:06:01] faster than that probably not in the
[00:06:03] words though because that's so difficult
[00:06:05] and you want to get all of
[00:06:07] them uh and look at look at Simon and
[00:06:11] CeCe they are they have um such a close
[00:06:16] close score cc is slightly faster than
[00:06:19] Simon but look she's already messed up a
[00:06:21] little bit little bit Yeah but it's
[00:06:24] supposed to be a two and a six she has a
[00:06:25] three and a seven and instead of a one
[00:06:27] she has a seven
[00:06:32] Simon is just kicking
[00:06:35] butt oh Simon
[00:06:38] no you need a five there not a
[00:06:44] zero okay so CeCe is taking a bit longer
[00:06:49] to fill in the things but
[00:06:52] sh but now she's now she's really
[00:06:56] getting there and remember everyone to
[00:06:58] go to extreme memory challenge.com once
[00:07:01] again extremem memory challenge.com it
[00:07:03] takes 5 to 10 minutes please extremem
[00:07:06] memory challenge.com
[00:07:08] so Simon corrected his first mistake and
[00:07:11] now his second he's so good at that he's
[00:07:13] amazing he is yeah and CeCe is for now
[00:07:18] struggling to find her I think it's one
[00:07:21] Pao image that she is missing there
[00:07:23] where she's lingering right now but pjv
[00:07:26] is just he's doing very well all green
[00:07:28] on his screen not even a single Mission
[00:07:30] there it's just going forward forward
[00:07:31] forward forward forward he can knock out
[00:07:33] johanes right now the defending
[00:07:36] Champion oh there's a mistake but who
[00:07:40] cares right about this one mistake is
[00:07:42] probably not but can he knock out the
[00:07:44] champion down goes frasia down goes
[00:07:49] frasia I don't understand
[00:07:52] that what do you mean by that this is
[00:07:54] when Muhammad Ali beat Walter frer not
[00:07:57] Walter FR oh my God I just named it Nick
[00:07:59] he beat um Joe
[00:08:02] Frasier boxing champion all right this
[00:08:05] is his comeback yep I see that you are
[00:08:08] coming from the sports area from the
[00:08:09] physical Sports
[00:08:11] area um all right but Muhammad Ali
[00:08:14] played a lot of mental games too so
[00:08:17] yeah which is impressive for a person
[00:08:20] with an IQ of
[00:08:22] 79 yeah was it really that's what I
[00:08:25] heard from his biography I'm not sure
[00:08:27] actually if that's true so I apologize
[00:08:29] if I'm spreading wrong information but I
[00:08:31] think it's what I just recently heard
[00:08:33] after he died away wow yeah he was he
[00:08:36] was an brilliant athlete in any way so
[00:08:39] and not not just a brilliant athlete one
[00:08:41] of the most amazing people ever
[00:08:43] seriously well he huge movement he was a
[00:08:47] little bit racist anti white for very
[00:08:50] long time doesn't really is being spread
[00:08:53] in the world but uh in his biography you
[00:08:55] can clearly see that the way he grew up
[00:08:57] I mean understand I understand of course
[00:08:59] why wouldn't he be exactly he mean you
[00:09:01] grew up now I don't think he would be
[00:09:02] maybe we're still a little bad all right
[00:09:06] so 50 seconds left in the
[00:09:11] recall okay interesting
[00:09:14] hanas
[00:09:16] spelled spelled biography in a way we
[00:09:20] don't spell it in German let's see if CC
[00:09:21] can fix her mistakes but I mean look at
[00:09:24] this Johannes is down 41 against kui's
[00:09:28] 47
[00:09:30] it doesn't look good he has only 25
[00:09:33] seconds left p is even filling in those
[00:09:35] gaps there it seemed to be incorrect but
[00:09:38] nevertheless um oh no it looks it looks
[00:09:42] really really bad for johannas this is a
[00:09:45] great score 41 but it's not good enough
[00:09:48] for Pui 47 will be seconds to go 5
[00:09:51] Seconds To Go the Mongolian team is
[00:09:55] moving into the finals with Pui with
[00:09:58] pfia Denis saon who is in the finals of
[00:10:01] the xmt 2016 congratulations what an
[00:10:05] amazing memory athlete he just knocked
[00:10:08] him out 40 W look at that the Mongolian

[00:10:15] out there if you are watching this and
[00:10:17] you are a minor I mean doesn't really
[00:10:18] matter if you're a minor but if you're
[00:10:20] still a teenager this guy can be a new
[00:10:23] role model he's just doing this for a
[00:10:25] few years now and he's already beating
[00:10:28] the number one in in the world he has
[00:10:30] beaten the current world memory Champion
[00:10:33] he's like completely kickass can we get
[00:10:36] a shot of um Johannes and now he's
[00:10:39] getting off his

[00:10:59] fantastic he powered through this and
[00:11:01] look at this now he is holding up his
[00:11:03] head and he earned it and at the same
[00:11:06] time we see Simon beating CeCe there
[00:11:10] putting him into a where are the flowers
[00:11:13] they should be giving flowers good
[00:11:14] position to move into the finance but
[00:11:17] it's not done yet Simon is ready to

[00:11:29] off track here

[00:11:43] of happy she does she doesn't really
[00:11:45] feel she made it to the final four she
[00:11:47] could still even if she loses course
[00:11:49] when she's dropping out now she has done
[00:11:52] so well already so she has basically
[00:11:55] nothing to lose of course she wants to
[00:11:56] go to the finals and what how crazy

[00:16:52] tournament 2016 we are in the semifinal
[00:16:56] the
[00:16:56] first um decision has already been made
[00:16:59] Johannes Malo has been thrown out of the
[00:17:04] competition by P Rafia from Mongolia the
[00:17:08] junior who is on fire and we are now
[00:17:10] looking at maybe the last match of the
[00:17:13] semifinal Simon Reinhardt is in the lead
[00:17:16] with three against one against setul
[00:17:20] soric B from Mongolia as well so they
[00:17:24] are doing
[00:17:27] words and and
[00:17:29] Simon is really good at words let's have
[00:17:32] a quick look at what CCE did there in
[00:17:36] words before what was her oh she is a
[00:17:39] number five 48 so we cannot really say
[00:17:42] that Simon is going to win this uh he
[00:17:45] did he did it in 55 seconds all the
[00:17:48] words with no mistakes but hey this is a
[00:17:50] lot of pressure here this is a
[00:17:51] semi-final of the xmt so just because he
[00:17:54] did it before doesn't mean he can do it
[00:17:56] right now what we seeing here on the
[00:17:57] screen are the Champions card that I
[00:17:59] created for our xmt Champions on the
[00:18:02] left we see Simon Reinhardt uh let's
[00:18:05] let's let's focus on the words he's
[00:18:07] memorizing in German he's memorizing two
[00:18:09] words at a time um CeCe is memorizing in
[00:18:12] Mongolian obviously and she puts four
[00:18:14] words on one location and look at this
[00:18:17] she only has 300 300 single lowai yeah
[00:18:22] 300 objects in her memory palaces
[00:18:25] compared to 10 times more uh for R who
[00:18:28] has
[00:18:29] 3,000 but it doesn't really makes a huge
[00:18:33] difference here obviously she seems to
[00:18:35] handle those few locations very well
[00:18:37] well here we go this huge event right
[00:18:39] here and it has started they are
[00:18:41] memorizing their words she's going at
[00:18:45] a oh no no similar
[00:18:49] Pace pretty much although that doesn't
[00:18:52] really make huge difference I think
[00:18:55] because they might they might even have
[00:18:58] completely different speeds there one is
[00:19:00] maybe memorizing twice as fast um just
[00:19:04] like we saw with johanes and Pui before
[00:19:07] although johanes didn't really pull it
[00:19:10] off so yeah they have 10 seconds left
[00:19:13] CCE hasn't really looked at all of them
[00:19:15] Simon neither oo 4 seconds left she has
[00:19:21] 56.72 and she didn't had a chance to
[00:19:24] look at the last two except when she was
[00:19:27] just looking at side with the eyes I'm
[00:19:29] not sure if she was able to pick them up
[00:19:31] we'll see this could be the knockout
[00:19:32] round she didn't she didn't put them
[00:19:34] into the center but hey she was zooming
[00:19:37] in on Simon's fingers in her head
[00:19:40] Simon's fingers again in her
[00:19:44] head exactly
[00:19:47] so what is going on all right so um she
[00:19:51] get one of the last it stops with
[00:19:53] cannabis cannabis is number 50 he the
[00:19:56] word Canabis something
[00:19:59] she didn't get that um she's missing
[00:20:02] this one but she picked up the number 49
[00:20:04] although it wasn't centered so she had a
[00:20:06] look that should be an easy uh word to
[00:20:09] remember
[00:20:10] cannabis it's as easy as most other
[00:20:13] concrete
[00:20:14] nouns uh so house cat Mouse cannabis
[00:20:20] that that's all something that you can
[00:20:21] easily visualize well actually I think
[00:20:24] cannabis is more difficult than Mouse
[00:20:27] what what do you visualize there a joint
[00:20:29] a leaf
[00:20:31] or or a cannabis texture textile I pict
[00:20:37] a big leaf field of cannabis right
[00:20:40] something like that but it's not as
[00:20:41] clear as house and mouse right no so
[00:20:43] it's actually more difficult tiny bit
[00:20:46] Yeah a tiny bit
[00:20:47] Yeah but let's see okay he is he doing
[00:20:51] the K style yeah just typing in just
[00:20:54] typing in the first letters to remind
[00:20:57] himself and we fly going in for the kill
[00:21:00] let's see they all oh there's one is
[00:21:03] there a mistake already in the first
[00:21:04] letters he did there no it looks good so
[00:21:07] far I haven't really double checked
[00:21:09] everything there yet and my
[00:21:10] eyes takes so much time just for my eyes
[00:21:13] to fly away while he is already
[00:21:15] everything oh no oh no CC no but Simon
[00:21:18] has a has a has a has a mixture on
[00:21:21] 293
[00:21:23] um everything else looks right for Simon
[00:21:27] but
[00:21:29] 30 he he switched he might struggle with
[00:21:31] 23 C has a lot of omissions there he
[00:21:35] strug might struggle 23 like I said oh
[00:21:37] no he got it two more
[00:21:41] minutes am I saying this right
[00:21:44] guden that means founding Sean that
[00:21:49] means um sailor oh he got that wrong he
[00:21:52] got s wrong yeah he switched 29 and
[00:21:57] 30
[00:21:59] and CC got a spelling mistake on
[00:22:02] 12 there she has so many she has so many
[00:22:05] omissions that's Lo that's looking
[00:22:08] really bad but she still has look at
[00:22:11] Simon 48 right now is he going to switch
[00:22:14] those two I think it doesn't really
[00:22:16] matter it really looks like he's going
[00:22:18] he's taking this home because she has
[00:22:20] these omissions and it's also so hard if
[00:22:22] you have omissions in the world she can
[00:22:24] finish it of course yeah but it's much
[00:22:27] harder compared to numbers or cards wow
[00:22:31] and she has another spelling mistake on
[00:22:33] number one it seems it looks like the
[00:22:34] word is actually correct but there's
[00:22:36] missing
[00:22:37] one Simon looks like he's going back to
[00:22:40] the
[00:22:42] finals what does he saying right now
[00:22:45] Florian what am I having for dinner I
[00:22:50] don't no this looks this looks like it
[00:22:54] will be Simon against puji in the finals
[00:22:58] 35 seconds to
[00:23:00] go come on girl you can't do that come
[00:23:03] on woman not girl or a lady right I
[00:23:06] don't I'm not quite she's still a
[00:23:08] junior I don't know yeah you're right
[00:23:11] she is a girl she is 15
[00:23:14] right yeah yeah she's a girl you're
[00:23:17] right she's a
[00:23:19] girl at least one more month then she's
[00:23:21] turning 16 and this is a man 10
[00:23:24] seconds he looks like he knows he knows
[00:23:28] already that what do she just she has
[00:23:30] such a good chance with that and Simon's
[00:23:33] heading to the finals congratulations
[00:23:36] Simon Reinhard once more you are proving
[00:23:38] that you are one of the best memory
[00:23:41] athletes in the world and I'm I'm sure
[00:23:44] that he is smiling about our
[00:23:46] conversation that we had last evening
[00:23:48] for dinner when I
[00:23:50] was um asking him if if if he is if he's
[00:23:54] trying
[00:23:55] to um yeah
[00:23:59] keep up with all these newcomers who are
[00:24:01] trying to surpass him this is amazing
[00:24:04] and he doesn't have to hide before
[00:24:07] anyone he's so good with all of these
[00:24:10] disciplines he's a he's extremely good
[00:24:13] all of these disciplines I think I
[00:24:15] haven't really seen a fantastic time yet
[00:24:18] with him for images Let's uh quickly see
[00:24:21] what where he is he's far down there
[00:24:24] Simon I don't even see him on the first
[00:24:26] page well now that we're finish with the
[00:24:28] competition people should go to extrem
[00:24:30] memory challenge.com and take the
[00:24:32] challenge 5 to 10 minutes you I know
[00:24:34] it's Saturday but just do it do it have
[00:24:38] a look at this Simon's Simon's best time
[00:24:42] in images is 60 seconds that doesn't
[00:24:44] mean he cannot memorize fast but it
[00:24:46] clearly means that his strategy
[00:24:48] throughout the entire competition was
[00:24:50] the other one will make mistakes mhm and
[00:24:54] they memorized faster they probably saw
[00:24:56] the blue screen
[00:24:58] and decided to go for the 60 seconds
[00:25:00] maybe he decided that even before that
[00:25:02] actually an interesting question that we
[00:25:04] can ask him when we get a chance with it
[00:25:06] right I know it's going back on screen

[00:11:17] tournaments he pretty he pretty much is
[00:11:19] he is um he won the world memory
[00:11:22] championships in I think it was in
[00:11:25] 2010 and he was the runner up for it for
[00:11:28] quite often still the number one in the
[00:11:30] world rankings has the highest amount of
[00:11:33] points ever achieved by any of these
[00:11:36] athletes he was the only one who was who
[00:11:39] broke the 10,000 barrier point in the
[00:11:42] our traditional championships just to
[00:11:45] let you know there if you don't have
[00:11:46] anything if you don't have any
[00:11:48] informations about memory Sports so far
[00:11:49] we have different kinds of competitions
[00:11:52] the original ones the traditional ones
[00:11:54] they started in 1991 with a world memory
[00:11:57] championship in England and and from
[00:11:59] this Championship developed the entire
[00:12:03] sport until what we got today wasn't it
[00:12:06] a UK dominated sport until let's say
[00:12:08] 2005 it was and then Germans came in it
[00:12:11] was not just dominated by the UK it was
[00:12:13] only UK it was only UK okay that's why
[00:12:15] they kept winning and winning and
[00:12:16] winning exactly the first the first year
[00:12:18] I think was five competitors from the UK
[00:12:20] and
[00:12:22] um it has it has come quite far since
[00:12:26] the um Dominic O'Brien won the champion
[00:12:29] ship eight eight times exactly and there
[00:12:32] was still in the early years nowadays
[00:12:35] it's it's more versatile where the
[00:12:37] Champions are coming from so coming back
[00:12:40] to our um to our table with yanes and um
[00:12:44] CeCe you call her CeCe why do you call
[00:12:47] her CeCe that's her nickname it's her
[00:12:50] nickname I didn't know that so so her
[00:12:51] full name is z
[00:12:55] z um showing me up right now well we
[00:12:59] have it we have it all WR these the
[00:13:01] Mongolian names are there's five
[00:13:03] Mongolians in the tournament so they
[00:13:05] gave us all nicknames right um that's
[00:13:08] actually good to know because I didn't
[00:13:09] know about these nicknames I want to
[00:13:11] learn them but um anyhow now why does
[00:13:14] she have a paper overhead why is and he
[00:13:17] doesn't and he's wearing certain glasses
[00:13:20] right these are some gimmicks that our
[00:13:23] athletes have by the way the countdown
[00:13:25] has started in 20 seconds um they go mhm
[00:13:28] so her she has these she she has this
[00:13:31] paper around her peripheral view to
[00:13:34] block everything out from the side so
[00:13:36] that she's not going to be distracted
[00:13:39] and johannas has these glasses which
[00:13:43] supposed to do it thing I like them yeah
[00:13:46] but I mean they don't really block out
[00:13:49] the peripheral view I I think most
[00:13:51] importantly he uses because it looks
[00:13:53] looks cool and now we started here's the
[00:13:55] first discipline they are memorizing
[00:13:58] cards and as you can see when you're
[00:14:00] going on the xmt live website as you can
[00:14:03] also see here in our stream they do
[00:14:06] different styles johanes is memorizing
[00:14:08] two cards at a time cc is memorizing
[00:14:11] three at a time so what all these
[00:14:14] athletes are doing they have these
[00:14:16] memory techniques where they encode all
[00:14:18] this information into stories and they
[00:14:20] put these stories these images these
[00:14:22] characters objects or whatever they have
[00:14:24] in their memory systems on familiar
[00:14:26] places they go around a Memory Palace we
[00:14:29] will explain all these techniques
[00:14:31] throughout the next 3 days so don't
[00:14:33] worry if you don't understand the word
[00:14:34] what we are saying right now and some of
[00:14:36] the techniques are a little x-rated so
[00:14:39] we just to warn some people out there
[00:14:42] that's also part of it um yes the the
[00:14:45] crazier the stories are um violence
[00:14:49] sexuality um these Concepts anime
[00:14:51] characters well why how do you break how
[00:14:54] do we come from sexuality to anime
[00:14:56] character well anime characters you know
[00:14:59] they're kind of Infamous but actually I
[00:15:02] mean we have some young competitors here
[00:15:03] so they watch lot of anime but I'm a I'm
[00:15:05] a big anime fan I I I watch all Dragon
[00:15:08] Ball Z yeah of course but I mean the
[00:15:11] sexuality part is actually not so much
[00:15:13] related to them that's kind of a well
[00:15:15] you can use anime for sexual you can use
[00:15:17] everything for you can even use objects
[00:15:20] but I heard a couple of these guys used
[00:15:21] anime for some sexual ideas that's true
[00:15:25] but I mean you like I said you can use
[00:15:27] it whatever kind of cont
[00:15:31] what we now see they have already
[00:15:32] memorized so while we were talking they
[00:15:34] already finished sessi did 60 seconds
[00:15:37] which is the top time they have they
[00:15:39] have the maximum amount of 60 seconds
[00:15:41] for all of these five disciplines we
[00:15:43] have you stand
[00:15:44] 3072 seconds Hest did it in half that
[00:15:47] time and it's an impressive time and few
[00:15:49] people in the world can do that about
[00:15:51] 100 people worldwide are probably that
[00:15:54] fast but that's not even close to what
[00:15:56] he can actually do he can do much faster
[00:15:59] he kind of played it safe here but but
[00:16:01] her score looks higher than his right
[00:16:03] now her score what we see here in the
[00:16:06] recall is that they are now typing in
[00:16:09] all these cards they memorized and on
[00:16:11] johannas side we see a lot of red cards
[00:16:14] but uh each red card means M it's it's a
[00:16:17] mistake a green card is in the right
[00:16:19] slot but the time is still 2 and a half
[00:16:22] minutes here that they have for the
[00:16:23] recall so we mustn't assume that this
[00:16:26] will be a completely disaster foras it
[00:16:28] doesn't look good though but he can
[00:16:29] change everything so he might have just
[00:16:32] put a few look he now just moved the
[00:16:34] cards to the right he might do that a
[00:16:36] few more time and all of all of a sudden
[00:16:39] everything might be green so don't
[00:16:41] assume just because it's red now it will
[00:16:43] be red in the end all right so let's
[00:16:46] let's just see how this is going to play
[00:16:47] out cuz they have a 4minute recall
[00:16:49] there's 2 minutes left oh there are now
[00:16:50] a couple of red cards now for sassy H
[00:16:53] anding back well we never really know
[00:16:56] until the end right they can put it out
[00:16:57] she put it she put them out
[00:17:00] she's and screen looks good for her
[00:17:04] looks very good and for him too and oh
[00:17:06] and he just jumped he just he just
[00:17:08] corrected all the mistakes by just
[00:17:10] moving all these cards a few slots to
[00:17:12] the right and what he did in his mind is
[00:17:16] pretty much that that he's going through
[00:17:18] this familiar places and he might have
[00:17:21] messed this up in a in the first moment
[00:17:24] and he just thought it would be another
[00:17:27] position or he just
[00:17:29] jumped over a position and then you
[00:17:31] realized wait a second that's not how I
[00:17:33] memorized it and look it's now all
[00:17:35] correct the time the time is still
[00:17:37] running but both competitors are
[00:17:40] finished this is pretty cool let us
[00:17:42] maybe we can have a look at the other
[00:17:45] tables as well at the same time let's
[00:17:47] switch to Ben pritmore table two and Jan
[00:17:49] Henrik buer now Ben pritmore is a
[00:17:53] veteran he's a champion he is a three
[00:17:55] times World memory Champion grandmas of
[00:17:58] me memory a grand master of memory
[00:18:00] although this title is is now a lot of
[00:18:03] people have it right lot of people
[00:18:04] getting it nowadays not so much anymore
[00:18:07] because they changed the system how you
[00:18:10] get a Grand Master title when when Ben
[00:18:13] achieved it um they they didn't have
[00:18:17] these upgrades on these titles nowadays
[00:18:19] we have international master of memory
[00:18:21] we have a grand master of memory and we
[00:18:23] have an international grandm of memory
[00:18:26] that's all very just keep changing new
[00:18:29] sport yeah exactly um I think the most
[00:18:32] relevant thing here is that when all
[00:18:34] these rules were
[00:18:36] made years ago they didn't even know
[00:18:39] what's possible now I like how this is
[00:18:41] old verse new right now you have Ben
[00:18:43] pritmore he's 39 and then you have Yan
[00:18:46] Hendra who's 17 right right so Bennis
[00:18:51] Ben is going to win this with 31 seconds
[00:18:54] this is the UK versus Germany it's UK
[00:18:57] versus Germany although I don't really
[00:18:58] see it very much as a national thing
[00:19:01] it's it's more like athlete against
[00:19:03] athlete it's one one exactly so maybe we
[00:19:07] should explain how this entire
[00:19:09] championship format is working out
[00:19:12] for um people out there who are familiar
[00:19:14] with the football World Cup this is
[00:19:17] pretty much like it we have the group
[00:19:20] system we have um I think it's six
[00:19:23] groups with four competitors each and
[00:19:26] two out of each group will qualified
[00:19:29] today to go into the final rounds
[00:19:31] tomorrow and then there are four yeah I
[00:19:34] think there are four extra wild cards um
[00:19:37] to make it a full 16 right so there will
[00:19:40] be some third positions from the groups
[00:19:43] also going into the fin now how
[00:19:45] important was this first round of
[00:19:47] cards let's say cuz it looks like Yan
[00:19:49] Hendrick struggled a little bit right it
[00:19:51] wasn't so important that's that's very
[00:19:53] interesting about the xmt so you lose a
[00:19:55] game you win the next you lose a game
[00:19:58] you win the next so even if you if you
[00:19:59] lose the your first three or four
[00:20:01] matches you still have the chance to
[00:20:04] make it okay cuz it looked like y hendri
[00:20:06] was a little stressed you know he's
[00:20:07] grabbing his hair it was his very first
[00:20:10] event on the xmt in his life he's he's a
[00:20:14] he's a newcomer to he's ranked number 20
[00:20:17] Ben Ben is ranked 17 so they're kind of
[00:20:19] similar in rank it was a good match up
[00:20:21] for both of them you're referring to the
[00:20:22] ranks they had in the qualifications yes
[00:20:24] right y yeah
[00:20:27] don't um in interpret these ranks too
[00:20:30] too heavily because it will be very
[00:20:33] different today whatever they did in the
[00:20:35] qualifications it doesn't really give
[00:20:38] you the a perfect clue of what's what's
[00:20:41] going to happen here because it's um the
[00:20:43] qualifications are at home they're in a
[00:20:46] completely different surrounding you
[00:20:48] have to you have five attempts to get
[00:20:51] the best out of it and this is a very
[00:20:54] very different situation so let's have a
[00:20:56] look at what how this played out now
[00:20:59] uh while we were talking all the scores
[00:21:01] have already been done by the way this
[00:21:04] will be this will happen a lot we will
[00:21:06] talk we will explain and all of a sudden
[00:21:08] the the match is already done we eight
[00:21:10] hours of this today so we're going to be
[00:21:12] talking about a lot of different things
[00:21:13] exactly we will not always Focus exactly
[00:21:16] on on every single match that's very
[00:21:18] important all of you guys out there you
[00:21:20] can follow individually every single
[00:21:24] table on the live website on the xmt
[00:21:28] live
[00:21:29] you can see exactly what everyone is
[00:21:31] typing in if you don't want to see what
[00:21:33] we do here in the live stream you go on
[00:21:35] the website you go on the competitor
[00:21:37] that you want to follow and you see
[00:21:38] exactly what they typ and you can tweet
[00:21:40] at us if you want us to say anything if
[00:21:43] you have any questions tweet at us and
[00:21:45] we'll answer them all right hopefully
[00:21:46] we'll answer them yeah so let's see
[00:21:49] Johannes looks like it looks like the
[00:21:51] veterans took over this round uhhuh
[00:21:53] johannas and Ben pmore with the win
[00:21:56] exactly both got three points and CCE
[00:21:59] but you want to say the full name z zul
[00:22:03] z z z Batar I I think that's how we
[00:22:06] pronounce it I haven't I haven't
[00:22:08] actually um she's the youngest female in
[00:22:09] the tournament too
[00:22:12] mhm yes and then we have Ben one winning
[00:22:17] against Yan hendrik and we have anudari
[00:22:19] who's also from Mongolian who's also
[00:22:21] from the Mongolian team against Clay and
[00:22:24] she won with 40 seconds. 23 against Clay
[00:22:28] 6 seconds and he made play was a last
[00:22:30] minute um yes he he draw a white card
[00:22:33] because another competitor didn't show
[00:22:36] up who actually qualified but it's
[00:22:38] pretty interesting cuz he just started
[00:22:41] this these kind of competitions well
[00:22:43] he's already doing that for for for two
[00:22:47] years I think it's not that long but
[00:22:49] it's not that long but on the other hand
[00:22:50] you have some
[00:22:52] newcomers who are incredibly good so for
[00:22:57] example and they're a lot Young
[00:22:58] yeah for example we have aage aever
[00:23:01] trueu from the United States and he is
[00:23:03] like he just turned 15 yesterday his
[00:23:06] birthday yesterday at chil exactly and
[00:23:09] um he's he's incredible at least from
[00:23:13] from what I heard so far I haven't seen
[00:23:14] him in action yet he's very modest he's
[00:23:17] like all I just want to do is just see
[00:23:18] the other competitors see what they do
[00:23:20] I'm just having fun right I guess that's
[00:23:22] what happens at 15 so I think it's very
[00:23:24] important that that you don't think
[00:23:26] because someone is doing it for 10 years
[00:23:28] is MHM that he will necessarily be
[00:23:30] better than mine might be tired cuz you
[00:23:32] these guys memorize what like study six
[00:23:35] hours a day some of them well well let's
[00:23:38] let's see there's Ben pritmore again and
[00:23:40] Ben pritmore he already became the world
[00:23:42] memory champion in
[00:23:44] 200 4 was it I think yeah 2004 I was
[00:23:48] there winning there competing the same
[00:23:51] at the same competition against him
[00:23:53] basically and that doesn't that doesn't
[00:23:56] give him an an advantage at all it gives
[00:23:59] the experience there's not a single at
[00:24:01] the enti comp who has so many comp like
[00:24:05] him now can you like play with someone's
[00:24:07] mind right now like look at them and
[00:24:11] kind like you know get them off their
[00:24:13] game exactly so people do
[00:24:16] that well yes um I mean do they do that
[00:24:21] no but they could and it would be very
[00:24:23] bad I feel like that could that's so if
[00:24:26] you do psychological games with your
[00:24:27] opponent and that could really throw
[00:24:29] them off but so far the sport is still
[00:24:32] small and we are all friends and family
[00:24:34] here right so we haven't really come to
[00:24:37] that point where it really gets to I
[00:24:40] want to destroy my opponent mhm so far
[00:24:44] it's more a gentleman sport everyone
[00:24:47] respects everyone else and no one has
[00:24:51] tried to attempt these kinds of things
[00:24:54] except for maybe outside of of the of
[00:24:57] the disciplines that
[00:24:58] they might have some trash talk with
[00:25:00] each other but in a in a fun way not
[00:25:03] really not really in a mean way so I
[00:25:07] don't know where this where this will
[00:25:08] going in the future I hope it will stay
[00:25:11] friendly with the prizes getting bigger
[00:25:13] the prizes getting bigger we never know
[00:25:15] what's happening exactly so let's coming
[00:25:17] back to what's happening here though so
[00:25:18] they already finished the next
[00:25:20] discipline um Ben memorized 30 images
[00:25:25] this is the image discipline in 27.8
[00:25:28] seven seconds and he got a score of 28
[00:25:31] because he switched up two of these
[00:25:33] images um they are surrounded with a
[00:25:36] green or a red box like the cards green
[00:25:40] is correct red is incorrect Yan hendrik
[00:25:42] did it in 60 seconds Which is less than
[00:25:45] half of the time but he got all correct
[00:25:48] so he wins the match so it's really not
[00:25:50] about time with this it is about time
[00:25:53] but the moment you you make a mistake
[00:25:55] the time gets irrelevant and it gets
[00:25:58] back the 60
[00:25:59] seconds um so let's say in this example
[00:26:04] Ben was doing it so fast but Yan Henrik
[00:26:07] took it safe Y and he is winning now
[00:26:12] because Ben made a mistake resetting his
[00:26:15] own time um or maybe let's not call it
[00:26:18] resetting the time it's still 27 seconds
[00:26:21] that he got there but his score is 28
[00:26:24] and the score of yan Henrik is 30 so can
[00:26:27] we go to some of these images let's see
[00:26:29] so you yes let's describe like what
[00:26:31] they're seeing so um what is the first
[00:26:35] thing it's like it looks like a
[00:26:37] Christmas tree or something like some
[00:26:38] flowers then you have blueberries
[00:26:40] flowers then there's a guy with a lemon
[00:26:42] hisis with a lemon in his now in his
[00:26:44] mouth actually I used exactly that image
[00:26:47] on my on my on my training cards as a
[00:26:49] memory coach that's funny I used that
[00:26:51] for 04 sour what that means we will
[00:26:53] explain later and then what people need
[00:26:54] to know you are like the first for me I
[00:26:58] think you like you really know your
[00:27:00] stuff you know you study this
[00:27:02] extensively you have one of the best
[00:27:05] websites out there memory sports.com
[00:27:08] yeah I was I was the first memory Sports
[00:27:11] journalist no one has really specialized
[00:27:15] on that there might shoulder there we go
[00:27:18] there might have been some some people
[00:27:19] who um wrote about sports for mass media
[00:27:24] um television and newspapers but they
[00:27:29] now we have Dr Boris Conrad exactly and
[00:27:33] and with the US citizen Lance K chart
[00:27:37] chart yes and glance just won with a
[00:27:40] spectacular 17 seconds let's have a
[00:27:42] closer look at that he and I heard this
[00:27:44] year he studied a lot that's what the
[00:27:46] rumor was he really even more
[00:27:48] interesting even more look at this clay
[00:27:50] Knight versus anudari clay Knight versus
[00:27:53] anudari that was 18.84 seconds for Clay
[00:27:57] versus anudari
[00:27:58] with 18.01 it's basically the same time
[00:28:01] it's super fast imagine that there are
[00:28:03] 30 images and these guys memorized them
[00:28:06] in 18 seconds both of them and Clay
[00:28:09] although he was slower he won against
[00:28:12] anadari because she screwed up she had a
[00:28:15] couple of mistakes even some omissions
[00:28:17] there she didn't even know where to put
[00:28:19] them anymore so Clay won there was a
[00:28:22] that's a huge upset right there that is
[00:28:24] incredible they're tied 1-1 now yes for
[00:28:27] for you guys out there if you miss one
[00:28:29] of these matches you can always go back
[00:28:32] you click on you click on um matches on
[00:28:35] the xmt live.com website and there you

[00:28:50] and yeah you won't miss a thing in these
[00:28:52] 8 hours exactly you can always go back
[00:28:54] don't worry there's one thing missing
[00:28:56] though here's the match number three B
[00:28:58] versus L from the first round and
[00:29:00] there's an empty slot as if it not
[00:29:02] happened since we don't hear the sound
[00:29:05] from the room at the moment yeah you
[00:29:06] cannot really say what what happened
[00:29:08] there let's quickly go through the guys
[00:29:10] that just competed yes so Klay Knight
[00:29:12] he's from the UK he just got him we just
[00:29:14] explained that exactly Dr Boris Conrad
[00:29:16] so this is he's pretty uh intelligent
[00:29:19] guy he studies that um he's he works at
[00:29:22] the max plank Institute which is one of
[00:29:24] the most incredible places exactly and
[00:29:26] he does a lot of work there he's a ke
[00:29:28] not speaker and what people should watch
[00:29:30] out for he's a crazy screamer once he
[00:29:32] wins he is he is the guy we will have a
[00:29:35] closer look at throughout the
[00:29:36] competition because when it gets into
[00:29:38] the hot face if he makes it and it's
[00:29:40] very likely because he's one of the best
[00:29:42] memorizers in the world then when he
[00:29:46] loses we will hear it when he wins we
[00:29:48] will hear you want to give like imitate
[00:29:49] it right now yes or or he likes to say
[00:29:54] sha which is a word I don't want to
[00:29:56] translate right now
[00:29:59] that's [ __ ] we're not we're not we're
[00:30:02] not a television here so um we can say
[00:30:04] whatever we want right but he he almost
[00:30:07] um won the championship last year yes he
[00:30:10] made it to the finals he made it to the
[00:30:11] final he beat siman yes that was that
[00:30:14] was the moment that was the craziest
[00:30:16] when he was winning against Simon
[00:30:18] Reinhardt or how you pronounce it Simon
[00:30:20] that's very good that's a German way and
[00:30:23] Simon is he holds the world record for
[00:30:26] for actually not anymore it was taken
[00:30:28] away from him by by janja and by ktie
[00:30:31] both of them holding the long and short
[00:30:32] names records but but Boris bet him and
[00:30:36] Boris is also he also held the world
[00:30:38] record for names before Simon so all
[00:30:41] these guys they kind of take the records
[00:30:43] back and forth from each other and Boris
[00:30:46] when he when he bet Simon last year in
[00:30:48] the
[00:30:49] names um he really got happy about it
[00:30:52] you can watch the video Simon he has
[00:30:54] three records for xmt too that's true
[00:30:57] it's just like these guys are just
[00:30:59] incredible they're incredible but and I
[00:31:02] always want to say that whenever we say
[00:31:03] they're incredible they are incredible
[00:31:06] but everyone anyone can do it everyone
[00:31:08] can everyone can do that just with a
[00:31:10] little bit of dedication you don't even
[00:31:12] have to train 4 hours a day for years
[00:31:14] you can Alex Mullen who's also one of
[00:31:17] our competitors he won the last World
[00:31:19] memory Championship with just again that
[00:31:23] the 30 minutes of practice a day in
[00:31:26] average for one and half years well cuz
[00:31:28] he's a med student so he doesn't have
[00:31:30] that much time exactly and he he's um he
[00:31:32] has a he has a busy social life as well
[00:31:35] he just married his his high school
[00:31:37] sweetheart and they until they coach
[00:31:39] people together they train people
[00:31:41] exactly for real life situations that's
[00:31:43] another thing about this sport is that
[00:31:44] you can bring it out to the real life
[00:31:46] and you can do a lot of things with it
[00:31:48] that is very important because everyone
[00:31:50] who looks at the sport for the first
[00:31:52] time they say okay they are these crazy
[00:31:54] people and they memorize this boring
[00:31:55] stuff numbers and they crazy but
[00:31:58] that's true we're all crazy and it's
[00:31:59] also kind of strange to memorize numbers
[00:32:01] and cards but what what is important to
[00:32:04] understand is is the fact that we have
[00:32:07] these images in our head all all of what
[00:32:09] we memorize here are basically is
[00:32:12] basically translated into imagery and
[00:32:14] this imagery will then be taken as it
[00:32:17] comes and created into stories and these
[00:32:20] stories are funny sexy crazy scary sad
[00:32:25] and it's very entertaining to do that
[00:32:27] very very quick I mean these these guys
[00:32:29] do it in in a second these stories un
[00:32:31] less and for our age group it kind of
[00:32:33] works out perfectly the sport that's up
[00:32:35] up and coming because we're Millennials
[00:32:37] and we just kind of don't focus on
[00:32:40] things we go from one thing to the next
[00:32:42] and they're really teaching us how to
[00:32:43] focus on something and get something
[00:32:45] done that's using it like you can learn
[00:32:47] another language yes you can learn you
[00:32:50] can learn easily yeah 100 words a day
[00:32:53] and you remember all of them my
[00:32:54] girlfriend would be so happy when she's
[00:32:56] from Puerto Rico right so her whole
[00:32:58] family wants me to learn Spanish yeah
[00:33:00] and I haven't learned it yet so after
[00:33:02] this this is motivating me these guys
[00:33:04] absolutely and it's it's so impressive
[00:33:07] what you can actually do with this you I
[00:33:09] said you can learn 100 words a day
[00:33:11] that's the easy that's the easy approach
[00:33:13] you can even do a thousand words a day
[00:33:16] if you study from morning to evening and
[00:33:18] you will remember all of them might make
[00:33:20] a few mistakes here and there that's
[00:33:21] normal so it's not the memory doesn't
[00:33:24] get super perfect for that even these
[00:33:26] guys are doing mistakes you see class in
[00:33:28] the future in high school a memory class
[00:33:30] absolutely all the schools in the world
[00:33:33] and not just in high school in primary
[00:33:35] school so I could be seeing you at
[00:33:38] Harvard in the next couple years being
[00:33:40] Professor teaching memory maybe maybe
[00:33:43] although I I'm not really looking
[00:33:44] forward to go to Harvard because because
[00:33:46] that's the best city in the world yeah
[00:33:48] but that's that's already that's already
[00:33:49] the grown-ups why why don't we focus on
[00:33:52] the kids focus on the kids who need that
[00:33:54] so much more to get into Harvard in the
[00:33:58] first place because everyone with these
[00:34:00] techniques can improve their education
[00:34:04] so much because Nothing is Stopping them
[00:34:06] anymore from from memorizing and now
[00:34:08] nowadays people say ah yeah the memory
[00:34:10] skill is not so important you need to
[00:34:12] understand you need to to to to get the
[00:34:15] abstract connection of everything that
[00:34:18] that the information is giving you but
[00:34:19] that
[00:34:20] is misleading in my opinion because when
[00:34:24] I can memorize all the facts that I need
[00:34:26] for the entire sem of a of my study set
[00:34:29] in the first week or in the first two
[00:34:31] weeks then I then I give my brain the
[00:34:34] ability to create a skeleton of
[00:34:36] reference that I can then fill with the
[00:34:38] Flesh of the information step by step
[00:34:41] throughout the throughout the rest of
[00:34:42] the semester and really learn it so
[00:34:45] profoundly and with such a with with
[00:34:47] such a
[00:34:49] um good
[00:34:51] motivation and and dedication because I
[00:34:54] know I have all that already in my head
[00:34:57] and I could see even athletes like let's
[00:34:59] say LeBron James using these methods to
[00:35:02] see if a player does a spin move every
[00:35:04] time he gets in this s this area yes or
[00:35:06] you know he's going to try to dunk on me
[00:35:08] exactly you can you can put that into
[00:35:10] professional physical Sports and you can
[00:35:13] teach all these athletes hundreds and
[00:35:16] even thousands of statistics for their
[00:35:19] opponents for what they could exactly
[00:35:22] what you said so there's there's this
[00:35:25] there's this one athlete who does always
[00:35:27] this and that now s that's s versus
[00:35:31] Simon yes and he's blocking out the
[00:35:33] sound and everything around him exactly
[00:35:36] now we now we see um him having these
[00:35:40] ear moths but I'm looking at the
[00:35:42] Champions former Champions and they
[00:35:44] don't use anything that's a that's a
[00:35:47] very interesting thing because the
[00:35:49] better you get at that the less you feel
[00:35:52] distracted yeah at the at the beginning
[00:35:54] when you are that's another mind when
[00:35:56] you still new to the sport you you are
[00:36:00] easily distracted yeah the concentration
[00:36:03] is still lacking a bit although I don't
[00:36:05] want to say that s saman here from
[00:36:07] Mongolia is easily being distracted you
[00:36:10] just want to make sure ex while Simon on
[00:36:13] the other hand who is his component
[00:36:16] there he he doesn't really care about
[00:36:19] this at all because he knows that he's
[00:36:21] one of the best in the world and he has
[00:36:24] done this since 2005
[00:36:28] he's just super confident about this
[00:36:29] while San he's also one of the best in
[00:36:32] the world he's in the Top 10 rankings
[00:36:35] but he's kind of new yeah he just does
[00:36:38] this for I don't know but he is the
[00:36:40] Asian and Hong Kong Hong Kong Champion
[00:36:42] yes and that's something else that we
[00:36:44] haven't talked about how in Asia it's
[00:36:46] just becoming a huge sport the past what
[00:36:49] five years gigantic this is this is
[00:36:51] getting bigger than physical sport it's
[00:36:54] in Singapore the world memory
[00:36:55] Championship too yeah although this
[00:36:58] might not be
[00:36:59] the there's there are a few things going
[00:37:02] on in the world of memory we might want
[00:37:04] to mention this so far memory Sports has
[00:37:07] been organized by the world memory
[00:37:09] Sports Council which is basically a
[00:37:12] private organization run by Tony buan
[00:37:14] and and Ray ke like you said I mean xmt
[00:37:17] is much more exciting it's fast-paced
[00:37:20] it's one-on-one situations right and I
[00:37:24] think this is the sport that will
[00:37:26] actually move on Al
[00:37:28] although we have to see it more
[00:37:29] generally the other sport is not like
[00:37:30] going away anywhere we still like that
[00:37:33] it's it's just that so far for the last
[00:37:36] 25 years this has hasn't really changed
[00:37:39] and it started to look like an exam no
[00:37:42] one wants to watch people who sit for
[00:37:44] for hours in front of a piece of paper
[00:37:47] just with a with a headstone and they
[00:37:49] memorize this looks super boring well
[00:37:51] what we have here now this is live this
[00:37:53] is digital this is Fast Pace 101 I agree
[00:37:56] but nevertheless we have created a few
[00:37:58] days ago the in the International
[00:38:00] Association of memory the IM which is a
[00:38:02] new Democratic organization which brings
[00:38:05] memory Sports to all corners of the
[00:38:09] world and we want to keep it free we
[00:38:11] want to keep it Democratic we want to
[00:38:14] keep it fresh and young so this is why
[00:38:18] we are transforming the sport more and
[00:38:20] more into the digital Direction more and
[00:38:22] more into the faster Direction the xmt
[00:38:24] was just the first one but there will be
[00:38:26] others as well we have have the memo
[00:38:28] games who are digital we have the
[00:38:30] memorial which is digital it will come
[00:38:32] this year to Los no to um Las Vegas in
[00:38:35] November yeah it will be a big one it's
[00:38:38] only happening all four years and we
[00:38:40] already talking about new championships
[00:38:43] with completely new Styles the xmt is um
[00:38:46] on the Forefront of that absolutely now
[00:38:48] is this Johnny bionis Johnny Brion from
[00:38:52] um the United States versus Marvin
[00:38:55] vonius from Sweden yeah he's a sleeper
[00:38:58] pick right well not really a sleeper but
[00:39:00] he's someone that a lot of people are
[00:39:01] picking to win this well he was my
[00:39:03] suggestion for the winner this year
[00:39:05] Marvin is came in second he has he has a
[00:39:08] really interesting story
[00:39:11] Marvin started at the same time with
[00:39:14] yonas Van Essen yonas Van Essen is the
[00:39:16] two times World memory champion from
[00:39:17] Sweden mhm and yonas when he started to
[00:39:20] learn these techniques he contacted
[00:39:22] Marvin and he asked him for a couple of
[00:39:23] Tricks yeah and because they knew each
[00:39:26] other from
[00:39:28] um online forums and Marvin gave him
[00:39:32] some tricks and then all of a sudden
[00:39:34] yonas became the world memory champion
[00:39:37] and he just he just skyrocketed himself
[00:39:40] and for Marvin this was this was a bit
[00:39:43] shocking because before that he was with
[00:39:45] his training scores better than yonas
[00:39:48] and then Marvin continued continued to
[00:39:51] practice and practice and put the bar
[00:39:53] Higher and Higher and I made an really
[00:39:55] interesting interview you can find it on
[00:39:57] my website with him and he is he is
[00:40:00] really dedicated to become the best he's
[00:40:04] con and he already broke several work
[00:40:07] now and it looks like uh marn just won
[00:40:09] right here he got he got a really nice
[00:40:11] score 20 names it's not perfect they got
[00:40:14] look at wait what's on her hands did you
[00:40:15] see that no I didn't see that she has
[00:40:18] pink all over her hands no it was I
[00:40:20] think it's from her hair it was her hair
[00:40:21] yeah think she justed her hair and then
[00:40:24] I was all over her hands I think I shook
[00:40:26] her hand saw
[00:40:27] pink color there all right I like her
[00:40:30] style yeah this is janja alanu from
[00:40:34] Sweden he is she is Swedish no Mongolian
[00:40:39] Heritage Mongol yeah that's so she's
[00:40:41] really the sixth Mongolian in this
[00:40:42] tournament but from Sweden um she speaks
[00:40:46] like what like six languages 600 maybe
[00:40:49] what no I'm I'm exaggerating but but
[00:40:51] it's I think it's more than six and she
[00:40:53] is like she is the most uh
[00:40:57] colorful character on the competion and
[00:41:00] I'm not saying that because of her hair
[00:41:02] I'm saying that because her personality
[00:41:03] is really colorful and look at this guy
[00:41:05] we have Alex Mullen he just won the
[00:41:06] world memory championship and he is
[00:41:09] exactly so he's a force to be reckon
[00:41:10] with he is he is from from the entire
[00:41:14] field of
[00:41:16] competitors in in many ways the most
[00:41:19] impressive one because in such a short
[00:41:21] time with so little training he became
[00:41:24] the best in the world MH and he also as
[00:41:27] can see on his body language and when
[00:41:29] you talk with him he's so calm he's so
[00:41:32] relaxed he's so
[00:41:34] humble and I think this really is what
[00:41:38] makes a champion in in the in the memory
[00:41:40] Sports World it's he's a fantastic guy
[00:41:42] he won the world memory championship
[00:41:44] last year in China against Marvin who
[00:41:46] was leading nine out of 10 disciplines
[00:41:48] and in the last
[00:41:51] round surpassed him and became the first
[00:41:54] world memory champion from the United
[00:41:55] States putting the United States on the
[00:41:57] map for the first time because before
[00:42:02] him the United States wasn't really good
[00:42:04] at that um there was there was Nelson
[00:42:06] we're getting better right there was
[00:42:07] Nelson there was Nelson four time us
[00:42:10] memory champion and he created the
[00:42:12] extreme memory tournament yeah he's The
[00:42:15] Mastermind behind what we see Nelson is
[00:42:17] one of the most incredible
[00:42:20] people um and of course there were some
[00:42:24] other guys before that who also are
[00:42:28] very um valuable people for the for the
[00:42:30] memory Sports in the United States Ron
[00:42:32] White Chester Santos Ram COI but but
[00:42:35] these guys were on an international
[00:42:37] level not that high while Nelson was the
[00:42:40] first one who got under the top 30 which
[00:42:42] was really good and then now with Alex
[00:42:46] we have a world memory champion from the
[00:42:47] United States and sorry to hold you
[00:42:50] there immediately it made a difference
[00:42:53] in the awareness of how the sport is
[00:42:56] getting to the public in the United
[00:42:58] States so many interviews with him all
[00:43:01] around all around the United States
[00:43:03] people are now talking with Alex and
[00:43:05] asking him what what did he do he gets a
[00:43:07] lot of attention and that's fantastic
[00:43:09] because the United States
[00:43:11] is is really necessary to make the sport
[00:43:15] getting kicked off because it's
[00:43:18] it's Nelson also paved the way too he
[00:43:21] you know he's he found it when he was
[00:43:23] what 25 years old and Alex he started
[00:43:26] what
[00:43:27] 1920 right what is he now 22 24 24
[00:43:31] already 24 right uh he he started I
[00:43:35] think I think three years ago yeah three
[00:43:36] years so 21 but yeah they're all on TV
[00:43:39] shows now they're going on what's the
[00:43:42] one that Johannes was on that was which
[00:43:44] one I mean there so many Super Brain
[00:43:47] they're all basically most of them are
[00:43:48] the same shows in the United States you
[00:43:50] call them the Superhuman show Louis
[00:43:52] Angel just won it in January he won a
[00:43:55] $100,000 price pool there by memorizing
[00:43:58] 100 people's names now what what's going
[00:44:01] on right now this is the numbers okay so
[00:44:03] we have the youngest player in the
[00:44:06] tournament who just turned 15 right Yan
[00:44:08] versus everu everu is also super
[00:44:11] impressive guy we also mentioned him
[00:44:13] before he's the youngest competitor
[00:44:15] isn't he yeah and he's another humble
[00:44:16] guy like you from the United States and
[00:44:19] I talked with him last year mhm before
[00:44:23] the before the xmt before the US Open
[00:44:25] that happened here in Los Angeles the
[00:44:27] next one taking place next weekend in
[00:44:29] Los Angeles and he was wondering whether
[00:44:33] he should come or not and I I try to
[00:44:36] talk him into it because even if you are
[00:44:39] even if your skills are still low not
[00:44:42] saying his skills were low by then but
[00:44:44] even if your skills are still low you
[00:44:45] should go to a championship to to get
[00:44:48] the feeling of it to meet these people
[00:44:51] to get motivated to invest more time
[00:44:53] because the championship is always s a
[00:44:56] super great way way to get a foot into
[00:44:57] the door of memory Sports even you don't
[00:45:00] go to a championship to win it at least
[00:45:02] in the traditional ones M you go there
[00:45:04] to overcome your own limitations it's
[00:45:08] all about practice and he's 15 so he's
[00:45:10] got a lot to go and what I want to to
[00:45:13] say is that he didn't he didn't go to
[00:45:16] the US Open because he wanted to have
[00:45:18] another year of hot
[00:45:20] training and I think it really paid out
[00:45:22] can we go to let's go to Alex Mullen so
[00:45:25] he did the numbers in 22 seconds
[00:45:27] exactly so the numberous discipline that
[00:45:30] we see here that they're doing right now
[00:45:31] this is 80 digits in 60 seconds and he
[00:45:35] not even memorized all of them he made a
[00:45:37] he made a one mistake there a little
[00:45:39] switch there of of digits but he
[00:45:41] memorized this all in
[00:45:44] 2230
[00:45:45] 2230 yes and and and the other was
[00:45:49] 59.3 4 right that doesn't mean that he
[00:45:52] couldn't that by the way the I think the
[00:45:54] pronunciation of our Mongolian
[00:45:56] competitor here competing against Alex
[00:45:58] is no it's a
[00:46:02] Shir is it yes sh well all right I I I
[00:46:07] go for this on this I
[00:46:10] talking that's okay that's okay all
[00:46:12] right all right whatever he he has he
[00:46:14] has one of but it looks like he's
[00:46:16] beating Alex right now first of all yes
[00:46:20] because Alex switched 868 to
[00:46:24] 686 that's that's a little silly mistake
[00:46:26] but this happens but that's actually a
[00:46:29] big mistake I think what's very
[00:46:31] interesting here to point out is that
[00:46:35] um even if we see a score of 59 seconds
[00:46:39] here against the 22 doesn't mean that he
[00:46:42] cannot do fast this is strategy because
[00:46:44] he assumes probably that Alex is going
[00:46:46] for a fast run and he is counting on him
[00:46:49] making a mistake while he is taking all
[00:46:53] the time mhm to take to play it safe and
[00:46:56] be sure that he get get all 80 digits
[00:46:58] correct so this is all a strategy thing
[00:47:00] what's he doing right he just counting
[00:47:01] his well he's he's just double checking
[00:47:04] if he if he I mean he got a perfect
[00:47:05] score so another strategy aspect of his
[00:47:08] here is he didn't stop the time at 60
[00:47:10] seconds he could just do the entire 60
[00:47:12] seconds but he wasn't sure of course if
[00:47:15] his strategy is correct so will Alex go
[00:47:17] for a fast time probably but if he
[00:47:20] doesn't go for a fast time it's much
[00:47:24] better to not take the full 60 seconds
[00:47:26] because then they would have
[00:47:27] then I would have an even score 80
[00:47:31] against so they do 59 something my
[00:47:35] prediction actually for this
[00:47:36] Championship is that we already saw this
[00:47:38] strategy last year quite a lot and that
[00:47:41] we will see more times that are in the
[00:47:44] that are in the early 50 seconds because
[00:47:46] if everyone is doing 59 seconds then you
[00:47:48] don't get an advantage anymore so they
[00:47:50] will try to to do the safe time a little
[00:47:53] bit less safe with a little bit less
[00:47:55] time that that time is is very similar
[00:47:57] when I 22 seconds to Johan's record last
[00:48:01] year oh no was this year the world
[00:48:05] record 21.1
[00:48:08] seconds for the
[00:48:10] numbers you got them all correct in 21
[00:48:12] seconds yes that was he already did that
[00:48:16] last he didn't he are you referring to
[00:48:18] the it says the
[00:48:19] 2016 maybe there was maybe there was
[00:48:22] part of the qualific no he didn't
[00:48:24] qualify because he was already qualified
[00:48:27] top eight the top eight competitors from
[00:48:29] last year they already got um an entry
[00:48:31] cut into this year's x& automatically
[00:48:34] where the other 16 slots out of the 24
[00:48:38] competitors they had to qualify with the
[00:48:40] online qualification on the
[00:48:43] website wow so all right so we're first
[00:48:46] yeah let's let's have a let's have a
[00:48:47] quick look at the overview because I
[00:48:49] mean while we talk and talk and talk
[00:48:50] here they have already done so many so
[00:48:53] many matches this is they've gone
[00:48:55] through the images they've gone through
[00:48:56] the name names and numbers yeah we have
[00:48:58] already 17 it was a major upset by
[00:49:03] Shir
[00:49:04] Sher um beating Alex Mullen the
[00:49:07] defending World memory Champion exactly
[00:49:10] and then marwin beat
[00:49:12] Johnny so when we have now a look at at
[00:49:15] the groups then we will see that there
[00:49:19] are
[00:49:21] um in group a problem everyone has three
[00:49:25] points so far that's an interesting
[00:49:26] group that looks like a tight group
[00:49:28] right there yeah in group b Lance has
[00:49:30] fallen behind with zero points Group C
[00:49:35] we have Marvin taking the lead with six
[00:49:38] points the yep that's that's your pick
[00:49:41] right and then we have in group D we
[00:49:42] have Yan also with six points and the
[00:49:45] lead before Alex before um Shir you say
[00:49:50] I still think it's with a DJ sound in
[00:49:52] the middle but we will talk about this
[00:49:53] later and Everett going there at the
[00:49:56] botom end of his group but that was just
[00:49:58] the first two games so there is I'm for
[00:50:02] for ever you know he lost his first two
[00:50:04] events but like you said the first
[00:50:06] couple events don't really matter I mean
[00:50:08] they matter but you can still win it
[00:50:10] it's true but it's a tough group it's a
[00:50:12] really tough group um number D here with
[00:50:14] Yan and Alex and also um um I would call
[00:50:18] him chg
[00:50:20] now uh really strong we have hours and a
[00:50:23] couple days to get across yes we will
[00:50:25] ask him we will make an interview with
[00:50:26] him later right we bring him here in the
[00:50:28] Stream and we'll ask him exactly now
[00:50:30] what I've gotten out of the Mongolian
[00:50:31] players is they're very serious very
[00:50:34] serious they are very serious but but in
[00:50:36] general you see you see a different kind
[00:50:39] of dedication where the Asian
[00:50:41] competitors um the further east the
[00:50:44] stronger the stronger the dedication so
[00:50:47] Mongolia and China those are really
[00:50:51] Fierce why isn't why are there any
[00:50:52] Chinese athletes in this I don't
[00:50:54] understand why we had we had one
[00:50:56] competitor that was shein Bin who
[00:50:58] actually qualified for the xmt but he
[00:51:01] had a problem with
[00:51:02] the US Visa so there was well not you
[00:51:06] there was you I'm sorry about that there
[00:51:09] was a I don't know probably not a
[00:51:11] political thing but he had a problem
[00:51:12] with the VISA as a Chinese it's always
[00:51:14] well there be many so yes hopefully
[00:51:17] hopefully next year this will be easier
[00:51:19] for him she she been B he is the world
[00:51:22] record holder of one hour cards one of
[00:51:25] our C even crazier I don't think I could
[00:51:27] do that with you the 1 hour cards I
[00:51:29] don't know what we could talk about a
[00:51:30] lot of stuff we call it the
[00:51:32] marathon 60 Minutes of memorizing as
[00:51:35] many cards as possible and this this
[00:51:38] looks crazy we have these we have these
[00:51:41] tables with stacked packs of cards and
[00:51:45] chibin Bin he did 32 decks oh my God
[00:51:48] that's 32 * 52 cards over the years it's
[00:51:52] going to change digitally and you'll be
[00:51:53] able to use touchscreen yes cuz that's
[00:51:56] kind kind of annoying with 32 decks it
[00:51:59] is it is annoying for the athlete and
[00:52:01] it's incredibly annoying for the Arbiter
[00:52:04] I'm I'm I'm an obiter myself I have done
[00:52:06] this at the world memory
[00:52:10] championships you have to imagine how
[00:52:12] this how this works right so you have
[00:52:14] all these decks and they have to be put
[00:52:16] perfectly into their boxes so that not a
[00:52:18] single card is falling down to the floor
[00:52:21] and they have to be labeled from 1 to 32
[00:52:24] pack they have to have the exact name
[00:52:26] the ID of the competitor they have to be
[00:52:28] put into plastic bags and then we have
[00:52:31] these huge piles of plastic bags from
[00:52:34] hundreds of competitors I mean at the
[00:52:36] world memory championships we had up to
[00:52:38] 200 competitors actually and then they
[00:52:41] go into the arbitus room and then there
[00:52:44] comes there comes the first Arbiter who
[00:52:46] puts out the first pack of cards and
[00:52:48] takes to and and starts to control
[00:52:51] them and then for all these cards for
[00:52:53] one competitor and they don't do it once
[00:52:56] they have to it twice and if there is
[00:52:57] some irregularity going on there have to
[00:53:00] be there have to be a high Arbiter
[00:53:02] coming in who does it a third time so
[00:53:04] there are up to a million data points at
[00:53:07] a world memory Championship to be
[00:53:08] corrected manually by
[00:53:11] hand so this is much better digitally on
[00:53:13] your computer and right now we have
[00:53:15] vessel who's one of the funniest guys I
[00:53:17] met him yesterday he's the only one from
[00:53:19] the Netherlands right and and he's a
[00:53:21] newcomer he's a young brain a lot of
[00:53:24] hair on his head and uh yeah Katie code
[00:53:27] met her this morning on the drive to the
[00:53:29] extreme memory tournament very nice
[00:53:31] woman right from Britain exactly so Wes
[00:53:33] is here for the first time but also it's
[00:53:35] the first time I meet him which is
[00:53:37] always when I when I meet someone for
[00:53:39] the first time it really means he's he
[00:53:41] is a newcomer he seemed really relaxed
[00:53:44] yesterday but today I could tell he was
[00:53:45] steuding and he didn't want you to talk
[00:53:47] to him he gave me a look like don't come
[00:53:50] near me right they they need their
[00:53:52] concentration Katie is this incredible
[00:53:55] woman she is
[00:53:57] at the moment on par with yja and the
[00:54:02] two the two best female memory athletes
[00:54:04] in the world well she's ranked number
[00:54:05] five I know we're not going off ranks
[00:54:07] but right now coming into this
[00:54:08] tournament she's ranked number five
[00:54:10] right and she also holds the world
[00:54:12] record in memorizing 5 minute names yep
[00:54:15] 97 names 97 names exactly and that's and
[00:54:19] she's a UK Champion 2012 I mean honestly
[00:54:22] imagine that you're
[00:54:24] memorizing um a list of of names and
[00:54:27] faces in five minutes and she does 97 of
[00:54:30] them and we not and we not talking first
[00:54:33] names like here this is this is the xmt
[00:54:36] is doing the light version of it she has
[00:54:38] the world record in international names
[00:54:40] that's not even English names but names
[00:54:43] from all around the world they're like
[00:54:45] like geio Papa Papados and stuff like
[00:54:48] that and and she memorized that in a few
[00:54:52] seconds um we're just getting the
[00:54:54] question is there a group of death
[00:54:57] and to be honest there are several group
[00:55:00] of deaths because because these guys are
[00:55:02] so good I would certainly say Group D is
[00:55:05] a really tough one because yeah you all
[00:55:08] of them are really good but then when we
[00:55:10] look at Group C with Marvin Simon and
[00:55:13] sangi samdan that's what I'm really
[00:55:15] looking at top 10 world ranked
[00:55:18] competitors and what about group a
[00:55:20] everyone's tied up right now well group
[00:55:22] a group a we have Yan Henrik busha who
[00:55:25] is a new newcomer um he's a junior from
[00:55:28] Germany and we have z z who is um she's
[00:55:32] not a newcomer anymore she's she already
[00:55:34] had a lot of experience but from what I
[00:55:36] saw from her scores it's um far below
[00:55:40] what johanes and banded so and that's
[00:55:42] Marlo Knight right there he's one of the
[00:55:43] night Brothers there's two brothers in
[00:55:45] this tournament clay and Marlo and he
[00:55:48] was he was talking to me earlier this
[00:55:49] morning he was so excited that his
[00:55:50] brother finally got into the tournament
[00:55:52] right he is he's our oldest competitor
[00:55:55] yeah he's 48 years old
[00:55:56] right and that's very important again
[00:55:58] there are so many important things here
[00:56:00] our sport it doesn't matter it really
[00:56:03] doesn't matter that he's anybody can do
[00:56:05] this come anybody can do even if you're
[00:56:06] 60 70 80 years old you can still learn
[00:56:08] the skill and you can still be very good
[00:56:10] at that even on a competitive level and
[00:56:12] you can beat and well let let me say you
[00:56:16] can beat the [ __ ] out of an 18y old
[00:56:18] person and you feel good about it and
[00:56:20] you feel good about it exactly you could
[00:56:22] you could never run against that person
[00:56:24] or lift weights but you can you can
[00:56:27] memorize stuff well you could if you're
[00:56:29] Arnold or yeah probably I mean I would I
[00:56:31] would lose against Arnold certainly when
[00:56:34] lifting R even when he's
[00:56:35] 80 I I might beat him in running though
[00:56:39] so here's uh Johan
[00:56:41] johannas what another johannas well no
[00:56:43] that's it was no they just showed and
[00:56:45] that's K again oh yeah that's johannas
[00:56:47] that's johannas um but Katie in the car
[00:56:50] today when we were talking about
[00:56:51] memorizing names she's like once I'm out
[00:56:53] of tournaments I can't even memorize
[00:56:55] anyone's name
[00:56:57] that's Al that's also such a thing
[00:56:59] everyone assumes that when you're a
[00:57:00] memory athlete and when you use these
[00:57:02] memory techniques and such a and such a
[00:57:04] high level that you are naturally good
[00:57:07] at memory and that's not true yeah it's
[00:57:09] a bit sad yeah some people might say ah
[00:57:11] these guys that memorize stuff and what
[00:57:13] out there they even working probably
[00:57:15] just tired of it the thing is what it
[00:57:17] what is important to understand and
[00:57:19] we're the right place for this with dark
[00:57:23] Neuroscience um who dedicate their
[00:57:25] entire work to find memory improvements
[00:57:29] like the memory pill they have this
[00:57:31] fantastic um this fantastic memory test
[00:57:35] called um the memor the extreme memory
[00:57:38] challenge you can find that on I think
[00:57:40] the the website is called Extreme memory
[00:57:41] challenge.com is that right Max yep
[00:57:43] extreme memory challenge.com you can go
[00:57:46] there and do this test for free and they
[00:57:49] are actually doing the biggest the
[00:57:51] biggest memory test in the world so the
[00:57:53] more people are participating in that
[00:57:55] they more can can find out about
[00:57:57] differences in memory and they might
[00:57:59] find you exactly one of the extreme
[00:58:02] memories in the world yeah please take
[00:58:05] the extrem memory Challenge on Extreme
[00:58:07] memory challenge.com exactly maybe you
[00:58:09] have a memory that is so outrageously
[00:58:11] good that um you don't even need the
[00:58:13] memory techniques for it yeah because
[00:58:16] there's always some some upper scale
[00:58:18] like the like the 2% of of people in in
[00:58:22] the population that just have a
[00:58:23] naturally that's what Katie said she
[00:58:25] doesn't really use a technique for names
[00:58:27] which is pretty interesting right she
[00:58:29] doesn't use yeah right and that's she
[00:58:30] just does it that that is very annoying
[00:58:32] to some to some memory athletes
[00:58:35] whoes but that's just one event that she
[00:58:38] does that she probably
[00:58:39] uses she has to put more e effort into
[00:58:43] let's talk about these two guys right
[00:58:44] here all right we haven't talked about
[00:58:45] them yet we see Johan Randall abrina
[00:58:48] Johan on the left CHR he's from the
[00:58:50] Philippines the only competitor this
[00:58:52] year from the Philippines he the 2013
[00:58:53] Philippines Champion but he was here for
[00:58:55] the Third time in a row Y and then we
[00:58:57] have Christian who's also third time in
[00:59:00] a row here who he's from Germany I love
[00:59:03] his glasses the style yes he has he has
[00:59:06] this these cool glasses like joh but the
[00:59:08] difference to his glasses are um they
[00:59:11] are shaded okay you can't see his eyes
[00:59:13] so he's blocking he's blocking out more
[00:59:15] of the surround kind like a World Series
[00:59:17] of Poker we actually have to ask yanas
[00:59:19] why he even bothers to wear these normal
[00:59:22] glasses which have normal glasses and
[00:59:24] they don't block anything from
[00:59:29] nice
[00:59:30] style okay
[00:59:33] so I want to talk about yo Rand again
[00:59:36] yes so he 60 seconds so the words you
[00:59:40] can just pick any language right exactly
[00:59:43] and both of them obious let's see what
[00:59:45] they
[00:59:45] pick I think both of them no Christian
[00:59:48] does it in German yep and Johan does it
[00:59:52] let's go through some of these names um
[00:59:55] in in in England
[00:59:56] and you can get a total of 50 names
[01:00:01] correct um no I think it's 30 30 names
[01:00:06] it's 50 words words words exactly 50
[01:00:09] words cuz Christian right now has 34 you
[01:00:12] got 34 words right
[01:00:15] yep yeah exactly the words discipline
[01:00:20] is together with the names discipline
[01:00:23] mhm the more difficult one but tell me
[01:00:26] some of the names that they give you
[01:00:28] some of the words well the words will be
[01:00:31] it's really anything um pretty much
[01:00:34] anything yes the in in the traditional
[01:00:36] memory Sports we use 80% concrete nouns
[01:00:40] 10% abstract nouns 10% infinitive verbs
[01:00:44] yeah uh here at the xmt I think it's
[01:00:47] everything like every even even grammar
[01:00:49] words like um if well I just saw
[01:00:52] marijuana was on there I'm not sure
[01:00:54] actually I'm not sure about this um we
[01:00:57] got to we got to ask Nelson about this
[01:00:58] but there are some
[01:01:00] very very meaningless words now yeah
[01:01:05] with that so they give you a list of
[01:01:06] words you have you have a minute to
[01:01:09] memorize and then four minutes to recall
[01:01:11] it and it's all like you said random
[01:01:14] words yes exactly and with these words
[01:01:17] do you use numbers to memorize it no but
[01:01:21] that's the numbers game so this is this
[01:01:23] is what makes this is what makes
[01:01:25] discipline names and words both of them
[01:01:27] a little bit more difficult than the
[01:01:29] others you don't really have
[01:01:33] a super straightforward system for that
[01:01:37] what you what you do with the numbers
[01:01:38] and with the cards is you translate them
[01:01:41] into into specific images and I actually
[01:01:44] brought a couple of examples here we'll
[01:01:46] have a look at this
[01:01:48] later so you know exactly what you're
[01:01:50] doing you look at a 78 and you know it's
[01:01:52] goofy yeah for example but when you look
[01:01:56] at a word and it says accountant you
[01:02:00] have to visualize that and you have to
[01:02:02] put that visual that you've create out
[01:02:04] of the word accountant on your memory
[01:02:07] Palace so you have to be creative enough
[01:02:10] to find something that that you can
[01:02:13] actually visualize for that accountant
[01:02:15] is already a more tricky one but it's
[01:02:17] not the most tricky one imagine maybe
[01:02:20] something like
[01:02:24] um I'm blank
[01:02:27] here just you're blank just just imagine
[01:02:30] a really crazy abstract
[01:02:34] word um and you have to then come up
[01:02:37] with a with a visual for it Y and this
[01:02:40] is what these guys what these guys
[01:02:42] spatial memory and you can you cannot
[01:02:45] really prepare for that as well as for
[01:02:47] the numbers so if you're not really good
[01:02:51] from the beginning in in names and words
[01:02:53] you will have a harder time to really
[01:02:55] master this but you still can yeah it
[01:02:57] just takes a little bit
[01:02:59] longer and the same goes for the names
[01:03:02] let's say I mean let's let's use our
[01:03:04] competitors names here we
[01:03:07] have
[01:03:08] Marvin vonius and if you want to
[01:03:11] memorize that then you most likely will
[01:03:14] have a look at um at words that sound
[01:03:18] similar like that because Marvin bonus
[01:03:20] doesn't mean anything it might it might
[01:03:23] have a meaning but you don't know that
[01:03:24] meaning because you haven't studied um
[01:03:27] all the meaning of all the names around
[01:03:29] the world so you find a word that sounds
[01:03:31] similar Mar win it sounds like Mar which
[01:03:35] is the C in Spanish so if you speak
[01:03:37] other languages that's very helpful um
[01:03:40] win so he's winning something we can
[01:03:42] imagine he's maybe um on a little boat
[01:03:44] on the sea and there is money coins
[01:03:47] falling down because he just won the
[01:03:49] Heavenly lottery or whatever and then
[01:03:52] Bonia sounds like wall so he's like
[01:03:56] maybe maybe driving Towers a huge wall
[01:03:58] in the sea um and then the end
[01:04:03] onus um I don't know I mean this is on
[01:04:06] what do you think about that lone maybe
[01:04:08] lone l lonely L lonus onus that sounds a
[01:04:11] little bit like lonely it's already
[01:04:13] getting away from that but so you can
[01:04:15] imagine he's W he's lonely in the boat
[01:04:17] winning winning all that money and
[01:04:19] driving tows a wall okay so you just you
[01:04:21] really just break it up yeah and you
[01:04:24] just memorize each part okay I like this
[01:04:26] and for the cards part so we're with
[01:04:28] Melanie and uh fuj and Melanie didn't
[01:04:32] memorize all the cards in 60 seconds so
[01:04:35] we'll see how she
[01:04:36] does right well why do you say she
[01:04:40] didn't memorize all the cards she has
[01:04:41] the last card she does I thought she
[01:04:43] didn't know I think she did she did yeah
[01:04:46] okay but of course it's a possibility
[01:04:48] that the that the athlete is not even
[01:04:49] memorizing the entire amount of data
[01:04:52] that they're being presented at this
[01:04:54] will especially happening at the names
[01:04:56] and the words where most of the athletes
[01:04:58] are actually not exactly that good yet
[01:05:03] so while the cards the numbers and the
[01:05:06] images everyone is like memorizing
[01:05:08] everything normally it will not be the
[01:05:11] case for the words and the names except
[01:05:13] for a very few rare cases so we haven't
[01:05:19] really seen where the where the where
[01:05:22] the journey is going with with names and
[01:05:26] words yet while with the numbers and the
[01:05:28] cards you can already see okay this is
[01:05:30] going around the 20 seconds for the
[01:05:32] numbers and even slightly below the 20
[01:05:35] seconds for the cards and for the for
[01:05:37] the images even below the 20 seconds I
[01:05:40] think the current world record is 14
[01:05:42] point
[01:05:43] something um and I heard already rumors
[01:05:48] that some of our athletes are actually
[01:05:49] doing 11 seconds in their training 11
[01:05:54] seconds 11 seconds for 30 images right
[01:05:57] so right now we're on almost the last
[01:05:58] minute of the recall for cards and fuj
[01:06:02] is
[01:06:03] beating Melanie 52 to 50 right now but
[01:06:08] we also have a couple other competitors
[01:06:10] Marlo and johanis and then we have Johan
[01:06:12] and Christian but could we go to Table
[01:06:14] Three by the way you say fuj yeah I
[01:06:18] think I think his nickname is Pui p g
[01:06:23] okay so the last time I went up to them
[01:06:24] they that just might when maybe they
[01:06:27] were just in really competitive mode and
[01:06:30] they just went through it quickly and
[01:06:31] they gave me fake name
[01:06:34] uhhuh all
[01:06:36] right yeah we we talk with them we bring
[01:06:39] them we bring them to the screen look at
[01:06:41] look at his concentration right now
[01:06:43] Johannes right so Marlo did in
[01:06:48] 2792 seconds and yanas in 60 seconds but
[01:06:51] they're tied up so who's the winner
[01:06:55] well can you let us let us go on that
[01:06:59] let
[01:06:59] us on my screen here right now let's see
[01:07:04] um that's Marlo yanes you ask yep so
[01:07:07] looks like Marlo won yeah it's clearly a
[01:07:10] win for Marlo all of them got correct
[01:07:12] the score is completely correct and he
[01:07:13] was telling me this is his favorite
[01:07:14] event too right he's clearly the winner
[01:07:18] here now the old man wins the old man
[01:07:21] wins against the young the young man
[01:07:22] that's against the young man I mean this
[01:07:25] [Applause]
[01:07:27] this is typical for memory Sports yeah
[01:07:29] let's go back to group E so let's get
[01:07:33] Melanie Melanie H versus
[01:07:36] Melanie so he did in a faster time 39.5
[01:07:40] 2 seconds and 52 cards he did perfect
[01:07:43] perfectly she just she lost in both
[01:07:46] categories so next up we have Ben
[01:07:50] Pridmore vers yanas M okay this one this
[01:07:53] one is a really this is going to be
[01:07:55] great let us let us have uh let us
[01:07:57] follow with the the camera there what's
[01:07:59] going what's going pictures too Ben and
[01:08:02] johanes Y yeah the pictures are really
[01:08:04] cool aren't they although Ben looks a
[01:08:06] little bit like like he's a like he's he
[01:08:08] looks like a priest in like a scary
[01:08:11] movie he he could exactly he could be he
[01:08:14] could be theist Exorcist on that image
[01:08:18] that's very cool Ben pmore this is like
[01:08:20] a fun fact about him he went to the same
[01:08:22] school as Queen Elizabeth oh did and
[01:08:24] that's what he uses techniques with that
[01:08:26] school that he went to what do you mean
[01:08:29] so that's like where spatial memory
[01:08:32] memory pal memory
[01:08:34] pal that's interesting I didn't and
[01:08:38] remember guys to go to extremem memory
[01:08:40] challenge.com and take the challenge
[01:08:44] maybe be one of the best memories in the
[01:08:48] world but if you're not then you can
[01:08:50] still learn it and become the best
[01:08:52] memory in the world EX and then see if
[01:08:53] you have fun with
[01:08:54] it all right so maybe let's see if I can
[01:08:58] bring up some match information here
[01:09:01] about uh Ben and johanis because what we
[01:09:04] have let just give me a second here how
[01:09:06] many championships do we have between
[01:09:08] them how many championships yeah cuz Ben
[01:09:12] has three World
[01:09:13] Championships and Johannes has one and
[01:09:17] Johannes won the xmt last year he has
[01:09:20] five German championships this is
[01:09:22] incredible and Ben pmore has
[01:09:26] five UK championships as well to be
[01:09:28] honest I haven't really tracked how many
[01:09:31] championships I have won because both of
[01:09:33] them are yeah both of them s such senior
[01:09:36] competitors who are doing this sport for
[01:09:38] so long that um it it gets a little bit
[01:09:42] tricky to really follow that maybe if we
[01:09:44] switch on on my screen here for a moment
[01:09:48] we can have a look at these at these
[01:09:50] Champion cards that I created for
[01:09:52] them and what we see here on the left
[01:09:55] that's Ben pritmore
[01:09:57] and we well let me explain what we see
[01:10:01] here this is this is basically all the
[01:10:04] systems that our Champions are using on
[01:10:07] the left we see on the top on the top um
[01:10:10] left this tile here with a
[01:10:12] 1,638 this is the amount of
[01:10:16] loai in all the memory PS combined that
[01:10:20] b prar is using while on the other hand
[01:10:22] we see johanes Mala with 2,500 it's an
[01:10:24] interesting number but it doesn't really
[01:10:26] tell um their skill or anything you can
[01:10:29] have a huge number and you really slow
[01:10:31] in in memory techniques uh but it's
[01:10:34] nevertheless interesting interesting to
[01:10:36] see what what our Champions gathered
[01:10:38] here we also see uses two words yeah
[01:10:42] exactly so we follow we follow there in
[01:10:44] the in the middle slot we see the the um
[01:10:47] language that they use for memorizing so
[01:10:50] Ben is obviously using English and Johan
[01:10:52] is German uh it's little little
[01:10:54] surprising there I love their card
[01:10:56] system they have their own system right
[01:10:58] H system and then Ben system yeah let's
[01:11:00] let's do it step by step uh so like you
[01:11:02] said there Ben is putting three words on
[01:11:05] one location so he's creating this
[01:11:08] cluster of of a story where let's say
[01:11:12] house cat Mouse so he he makes a story
[01:11:15] with a house and there's the cat coming
[01:11:17] in and and and eating a mouse and he all
[01:11:19] places that maybe on on the coffee on
[01:11:22] the coffee maker in his kitchen and imag
[01:11:25] all this taking place in a really tiny
[01:11:27] version to fit the dimensions and yanas
[01:11:30] does the same but with two words and
[01:11:33] then when we go into the second row here
[01:11:35] we see um the question there
[01:11:38] was do you use Memory Palace for the
[01:11:42] names and that's an actually interesting
[01:11:44] question
[01:11:45] because uh as a beginner you often I
[01:11:48] often hear these questions most memory
[01:11:51] athletes don't Ben on the other hand he
[01:11:54] actually does he uses a Memory Palace
[01:11:57] for names and he's like super minority
[01:11:59] on that why is it why is is he a
[01:12:03] minority or why is he doing that why is
[01:12:05] he doing
[01:12:06] it because he feels more secure if he
[01:12:10] can go back to these familiar locations
[01:12:13] and then he has his stories placed there
[01:12:16] it's not necessary though because you
[01:12:17] can just hang your story to the face of
[01:12:20] the um of the person does this slow you
[01:12:23] down using the memory probably Ben is
[01:12:25] not the best one in names all right
[01:12:28] majority doesn't do that but but don't
[01:12:33] don't overestimate this um it's possible
[01:12:36] that some people can Master this and can
[01:12:38] use it really really
[01:12:41] nicely all
[01:12:44] right
[01:12:45] so so they're starting soon with
[01:12:48] johannas and Ben pmore looks like Ben's
[01:12:51] not
[01:12:52] ready Ben's in a very relaxed
[01:12:56] outfit he's wearing the the the famous
[01:12:59] zi t-shirt this is like one of the most
[01:13:02] famous t-shirts in in memory Sports he's
[01:13:06] always having this one it's a he's also
[01:13:08] called it's his nickname Zumi and he
[01:13:10] writes he blocks under the name Zumi now
[01:13:13] what do the competitors do on the side
[01:13:14] are they just relaxing or are they
[01:13:16] really watching and paying attention to
[01:13:17] these competitors the others yeah I I
[01:13:20] cannot really say but I would I would
[01:13:23] probably not watch them too closely
[01:13:24] because I would rather try to focus on
[01:13:26] myself and calm myself prepare for the
[01:13:28] next match go through my M you clear
[01:13:30] your mind oh you do go through your yes
[01:13:32] absolutely look I mean now the time
[01:13:34] starts yeah the the Prem memorization
[01:13:37] time it's ticking down 20 seconds 19 18
[01:13:39] now and they use this time not to really
[01:13:42] relax if they if they do it right they
[01:13:45] really try to calm their mind and um get
[01:13:48] into a meditative State as much as they
[01:13:50] can in order to avoid stress stress is
[01:13:53] the worst thing you can have in memory
[01:13:54] and here we go 3 2 1
[01:13:58] start all right we have the names
[01:14:01] discipline that they're going through
[01:14:03] here look how quickly Ben's going
[01:14:05] through
[01:14:08] it Johannes is taking alth although
[01:14:10] Johannes is better y in the names it
[01:14:13] doesn't necessarily mean that he's going
[01:14:15] to win of course but in generally he has
[01:14:18] proven himself several times to be a
[01:14:21] little bit more skilled than I like the
[01:14:23] pictures they're picking I think I think
[01:14:26] what's what's really cool about Ben is
[01:14:28] that he's always complaining I'm really
[01:14:30] bad at names but he's actually getting
[01:14:32] better and better and better at it and
[01:14:34] he last year like aine get a super great
[01:14:38] score I'm not quite sure what it was
[01:14:40] like 27 is or something close close to
[01:14:44] the record
[01:14:46] actually so so memorizing ends in 10
[01:14:49] seconds we have other group CC and Yan
[01:14:51] hendrik Anu and Boris and then at table
[01:14:55] four Lance and Clay
[01:14:57] Knight all right and Ben sto the time
[01:15:00] 5856 seconds that's clever and I cannot
[01:15:04] understand why johanes didn't do a
[01:15:05] similar thing because everyone who
[01:15:07] starts 60 seconds in my opinion is a is
[01:15:11] not a very strategic approach you should
[01:15:13] you should always go at least one second
[01:15:16] under the 60 seconds otherwise if you
[01:15:18] tie up you will not get the point at
[01:15:20] table two they both did in 60 seconds
[01:15:22] Yan hendrik and CeCe
[01:15:25] right and Boris stopped at 57.
[01:15:30] 28o at 58 he needs this right so I think
[01:15:35] I think that Boris did the smartest move
[01:15:37] there with the 57 because if you just
[01:15:39] also if you just go one second below the
[01:15:41] 60 second everyone does that then you
[01:15:43] don't get the advantage anymore so you
[01:15:45] want to go lower than everyone else
[01:15:47] lower than your opponent so and for
[01:15:51] someone like johannas I think the sport
[01:15:54] extreme tourament is great for him
[01:15:56] because you said you physically have to
[01:15:58] do things at the world championship
[01:16:00] that's kind of Henrik he is already at
[01:16:03] 22 names and he he still has three
[01:16:05] minutes he just recalled 22 names in
[01:16:09] less than 60 seconds that's incredible
[01:16:12] that's now you have time to relax and
[01:16:13] get it done fast super fast he has a lot
[01:16:15] of time to come up with with the rest of
[01:16:17] it now if he can yeah everyone else is
[01:16:20] under 20 names right now everyone else
[01:16:22] is like slowly getting johanes is
[01:16:25] beating Ben but there's still 2 minutes
[01:16:28] and 30 seconds left right and Boris is
[01:16:31] beating on new and Lance is beating
[01:16:34] clay Klay went back down he was at eight
[01:16:36] and now seven yeah but like always don't
[01:16:40] don't that it will end like this there
[01:16:43] is a time there's time left and they can
[01:16:45] all correct Yan Henrik is already at 24
[01:16:47] this is an amazing score I mean I'm
[01:16:50] doing this for 13 years and names to
[01:16:54] getting over 20 names is a tough one but
[01:16:58] look at this look at this so Johannes is
[01:17:00] creeping up on Yan Hendrick yes and also
[01:17:06] 21 yep so the veterans are doing very
[01:17:10] well they're kicking ass Ben is looking
[01:17:13] really hopeless here with it with his
[01:17:17] 10 yeah wow he maybe he did it too
[01:17:19] quickly at one may maybe he did maybe
[01:17:21] they were just red names and cuz he was
[01:17:24] flying through there he was flying
[01:17:25] through them and then again that that
[01:17:27] shows you just because they are looking
[01:17:29] at the information very quickly doesn't
[01:17:31] necessarily mean that they are faster
[01:17:34] they are better than than the others
[01:17:35] right
[01:17:37] so there's so much strategy involved in
[01:17:40] everything from the first second where
[01:17:42] it starts even before it
[01:17:44] starts let's look at some of these names
[01:17:46] they memorize Kelly Brady
[01:17:50] Bernice now does it help the first
[01:17:53] letter in the name memorizing it
[01:17:55] is that like the most important thing or
[01:17:57] no no I mean of course it's better than
[01:17:59] nothing yeah but if you just get the age
[01:18:02] from Harry there are so many other H
[01:18:05] names there's a lot of B names and it's
[01:18:07] it's really not a good idea you should
[01:18:09] you should rather have a concrete image
[01:18:12] for a specific name so Theodore for
[01:18:15] example I would make a teddy bear out of
[01:18:16] it for um Teddy roselt Theo roseld can
[01:18:20] we can we go to um group so we'll go to
[01:18:23] table two right now you
[01:18:25] yeah let's have let's have a look at Jan
[01:18:27] Henrik he nearly is going to the world
[01:18:30] record there with 26 the world the
[01:18:31] current world record I think is is it 28
[01:18:35] or
[01:18:36] 29 let's see the world record is right
[01:18:38] we can see it on the website here it is
[01:18:41] 28 by seiman Simon in uh 2016 right yep
[01:18:46] let's let's see if y kri uses the last
[01:18:49] 20 seconds we have four guys in the 20s
[01:18:51] right
[01:18:52] now Johannes Hendrick Boris and Lance
[01:18:56] there's 10 seconds left and let's go
[01:18:59] back to table two we're here here we go
[01:19:02] yeah 5 seconds left and Y Jan Henrik is
[01:19:05] going to win this round not just against
[01:19:08] he seems a little bit upset but look at
[01:19:10] the look at his face I think he wanted
[01:19:13] the
[01:19:14] record he has many more chances for
[01:19:16] exactly he has many more chances there
[01:19:17] are so many there are so many matches
[01:19:19] and can we quickly go to table
[01:19:22] four yeah that was Lance against play I
[01:19:25] mean all those winners got 22 or more
[01:19:29] this is these are really good
[01:19:31] [Applause]
[01:19:37] scores all right so Johan's really but
[01:19:40] it's true Jan Henrik doesn't look too
[01:19:42] happy no he
[01:19:44] does but he probably and you you can't
[01:19:46] even he probably wanted to go for the
[01:19:48] record yeah no yeah otherwise otherwise
[01:19:50] I would to off come on of course is that
[01:19:55] like what I hear what I've learned from
[01:19:57] memory athletes is that it's mostly
[01:20:00] about records sure of course I mean it's
[01:20:03] not me it's not memory I mean every
[01:20:06] sport you want you want to you want to
[01:20:08] win you want to break a record you want
[01:20:10] to in table three
[01:20:13] Dr get into the get into into history
[01:20:17] with your results of course so a world
[01:20:19] record is what what you striving
[01:20:22] for so numbers we got to look at
[01:20:25] johannas for this one because he has the
[01:20:26] xmt record at 21 seconds exactly so
[01:20:30] let's let's stick with him again him and
[01:20:32] Ben and and see what is happening also
[01:20:35] Ben
[01:20:36] is really good at at numbers he used to
[01:20:39] have the numbers world record so way
[01:20:43] back though but did Johannes beat him
[01:20:46] yeah actually Johannes was the one who
[01:20:48] took away his word record as far as I
[01:20:51] remember I remember when I started with
[01:20:54] memory sport
[01:20:55] um we have this discipline called speed
[01:20:57] I can't tell your age 2003 what are you
[01:21:00] like
[01:21:03] 18 um we're starting in 5 4 3 2 one in
[01:21:10] numbers all right and let's see Ben has
[01:21:14] a system where he looks at three digits
[01:21:16] at a time johannas is looking at six
[01:21:18] digits at a time but group 3 three 3
[01:21:22] three that system both both of have a
[01:21:25] memory system with 1,000 images yes and
[01:21:28] that means they encode all possibilities
[01:21:30] from 00 to 999 the difference
[01:21:34] between Ben and Johannes is
[01:21:37] actually they don't they even have the
[01:21:39] same approach they do the same thing
[01:21:41] they just look at it differently so
[01:21:43] while Ben is looking at one three-digit
[01:21:46] image at the same time but he still does
[01:21:48] two or three of them together clustered
[01:21:50] on one location johanes looks at them
[01:21:53] right doesn't even like move he just he
[01:21:56] literally just and know he doesn't look
[01:21:59] nervous at all and Ben he's looking a
[01:22:01] little bit nervous he's scratching
[01:22:03] himself right well he knows that he is
[01:22:06] competing against the the best the
[01:22:08] champion at the
[01:22:10] moment so 57 seconds and you can see
[01:22:13] also in his result he look at that
[01:22:16] 25.2 seconds right but Ben really did a
[01:22:19] strategically good choice that he got a
[01:22:21] 57 second score that's a really good
[01:22:24] that that's a really good time it's not
[01:22:26] it's not the 60 seconds it's not 59
[01:22:28] seconds so but look how quickly Ben's
[01:22:30] doing it right now oh no not the same
[01:22:32] speed well actually although Johannes is
[01:22:36] not picking up here on that
[01:22:38] speed Ben is the fastest one in recall
[01:22:41] as far as I I can tell I mean he's at 35
[01:22:43] right now I me what Yan HRI did before
[01:22:46] with the words was super impressive but
[01:22:48] in generally what I picked up here Ben
[01:22:50] is the fastest recaller actually we
[01:22:53] should have a a dis in the future who
[01:22:55] can recall as much information the
[01:22:58] fastest Ben would certainly win that one
[01:23:00] I look at this
[01:23:02] near there's three minutes
[01:23:05] left
[01:23:08] right can we go to Table
[01:23:13] Three Boris is just beinging the living
[01:23:15] daylight out of
[01:23:17] Anu 68 to 32 right now I know that's not
[01:23:20] what matters cuz it at the end but
[01:23:22] there's 3 minutes right yeah so those
[01:23:24] times that we see here with Boris and
[01:23:27] anudari I I find them a b bit tricky um
[01:23:31] terms bis crying right
[01:23:33] now I doubt it maybe maybe after he sees
[01:23:37] the results but not before so do you
[01:23:40] need to really practice like your typing
[01:23:42] skills for the
[01:23:43] xmt no not really you have with the four
[01:23:46] minutes that's enough and it's just so
[01:23:50] little information they have I think Dr
[01:23:51] Boris is a crime he's just deeply into
[01:23:55] concentration this is a this is a very
[01:23:59] common position of for him I see that a
[01:24:01] lot you you can't even see do you can't
[01:24:04] see I I do this as well when I'm in I'm
[01:24:06] covering my eyes to block out the light
[01:24:08] to block out any distraction and just go
[01:24:11] as deep into um the mind as possible and
[01:24:15] I mean look at anudari she she doesn't
[01:24:17] have to do that because she's already
[01:24:19] covered up what is she using there
[01:24:21] that's the newspaper right there right
[01:24:25] he's at 74 NOP yeah 74 to 68 right now
[01:24:30] there's less than two minutes to go and
[01:24:33] right now Lance and Ben both have 80 so
[01:24:37] they have the perfect
[01:24:38] score
[01:24:40] right oh Boris Boris put in an incorrect
[01:24:45] image he he could correct it I speak I
[01:24:48] speak in images yeah of course he put in
[01:24:51] incorrect digits but I know that in his
[01:24:54] mind it is an image and here they are
[01:24:58] tied up now 74 if they are if it stays
[01:25:02] like this Boris Boris is about to win
[01:25:04] because of the time if anadari is just
[01:25:06] getting one more
[01:25:08] digit she will beat him despite the time
[01:25:10] I really hope he screams I'm waiting for
[01:25:12] it yeah actually this could be one where
[01:25:14] he scream he got to correct the next one
[01:25:16] so he has now 77 1 minute 1 minute to
[01:25:21] go he just needs to fix let's have quick
[01:25:24] look one the nine zero he's got a 31 six
[01:25:28] right
[01:25:31] there oh anadari surpassed him and Boris
[01:25:35] sits at at his mistake he knows that
[01:25:38] there's something 4 seconds yeah there's
[01:25:40] he knows there's something going on look
[01:25:42] he's he's locked into exactly the first
[01:25:44] digit there yeah he looks like he's
[01:25:45] getting rder he is he he's turning into
[01:25:49] one of the xmt t-shirts right now let's
[01:25:51] let's stay with him until the end here
[01:25:54] and see what is going to happen um how
[01:25:57] is the group looking of Boris is it is
[01:25:59] it relevant for him Johan and joh beat
[01:26:02] Ben because of the time right and you
[01:26:05] Boris Boris has six points so if he
[01:26:07] loses against anudari it it will not be
[01:26:11] the biggest drawback for him yet but I'm
[01:26:13] I'm sure that that he will not be happy
[01:26:15] about that he's down by one right now
[01:26:17] come on
[01:26:18] Boris and it's over it's over wow she
[01:26:23] just beat him he took it he took it very
[01:26:27] very well he knows that he's still he
[01:26:30] knows he's still in the lead um of his
[01:26:33] group that's very disappointing that
[01:26:36] change now because
[01:26:37] Lance and anudari both have six points
[01:26:41] as well as Boris so it has actually been
[01:26:45] quite dramatic but he's still at the top
[01:26:47] because of the percentage of recall does
[01:26:50] she have a what is that with her right
[01:26:52] now teddy bear yes like a
[01:26:55] masc something she holds exactly guys
[01:26:58] how's it going hereas four time US
[01:27:01] champion right here what's up I'm just
[01:27:03] stopping in to add some of my thoughts
[01:27:06] to the next match if that's Co all right
[01:27:09] what is what is the next match let's
[01:27:10] have a look at that of the guards here
[01:27:14] Sim versus Johnny and it's images in
[01:27:17] group so table two all right that's cool
[01:27:21] yeah we haven't really had a chance to
[01:27:22] really follow the image disciplines yet
[01:27:24] in detail because we were talking so
[01:27:26] much about explaining everything this
[01:27:27] all going so on so quickly so maybe you
[01:27:30] can maybe you can explain a little bit
[01:27:32] about about that discipline the images
[01:27:34] images Yeah so basically it's uh 30
[01:27:37] images random photos that we I guess
[01:27:40] have curated of anything it can be
[01:27:42] beautiful landscapes funny dogs cup of
[01:27:46] coffee um Castle all over the place and
[01:27:49] there's 30 of them little square images
[01:27:52] and they have to memorize them like a
[01:27:53] DEC cards but it's a deck of pictures 30
[01:27:56] of them in uh 60 seconds and they have
[01:28:00] to place them back in their correct
[01:28:01] order and what's the method you use so I
[01:28:05] I try to I pair two pictures at a time
[01:28:08] and I just squash them together in a
[01:28:10] picture so if I'll see a dog and a
[01:28:11] coffee it's a dog drinking a cup of
[01:28:13] coffee and I store that in a Memory
[01:28:16] Palace that's something easy to memorize
[01:28:18] yeah and you can see these guys do the
[01:28:20] images I can't do it that fast um but
[01:28:23] some will do it sub 20 20 seconds and
[01:28:25] you see them go through it so fast I
[01:28:27] don't know how they're creating these
[01:28:28] stories that quickly and how fast can
[01:28:30] you do it I think the fastest I've done
[01:28:32] it is maybe 28 seconds really I'm faster
[01:28:34] than you I'm I'm faster than Nelson
[01:28:36] Dallas ladies are you trying to show
[01:28:37] them up on live that's really cool fast
[01:28:39] time um I think 23 okay is my fastest
[01:28:43] one let's go right now guys that's
[01:28:44] really cool I mean because I'm really
[01:28:46] for me that's a cool thing because he
[01:28:48] was always better than me in pretty much
[01:28:49] everything in memory so I like it and
[01:28:52] he's climbing Mount Everest all the time
[01:28:54] what I find very interesting is about
[01:28:56] the images when um when I asked the guys
[01:28:58] what how they do that pretty much all of
[01:29:01] them said two images or more that put on
[01:29:03] One location together and I find that
[01:29:05] because I do it one image at a time that
[01:29:08] means I need 30 locations to memorize
[01:29:10] them yeah and when I think about putting
[01:29:12] these two photos together so let's say
[01:29:14] there's the picture of a of a desert and
[01:29:17] the next one is a picture of a boat on a
[01:29:19] on a lake then I guess I have to take
[01:29:21] the sand from the desert and the boat
[01:29:23] and I put them together in that image
[01:29:26] and it would just take me like this
[01:29:29] extra second of making up this SEC of
[01:29:31] making up this image so they do
[01:29:34] that and they save themselves um a lot
[01:29:37] of locations because they pared two or
[01:29:39] three and at the same time they're
[01:29:41] faster than I can do that with a single
[01:29:43] image so that's really really cool yeah
[01:29:45] if you saw in the last set of images we
[01:29:47] had which was of maybe an hour ago we
[01:29:49] had um CCE from Mongolia almost did a
[01:29:52] world record the world record record I
[01:29:54] think
[01:29:55] 14.4 she was at 14.8 right um which was
[01:29:59] insane and Clay who in practice has the
[01:30:03] best times I think he's done 10 seconds
[01:30:06] uh did a respectable 18 seconds um yeah
[01:30:09] two people I think that was a bit of a
[01:30:10] warmup for him yeah I would like I would
[01:30:12] like to see actually table four Now with
[01:30:15] uh chir and Yan by the way do you know
[01:30:18] how you pronounce his name perfectly I
[01:30:20] asked she's here she's here yeah I
[01:30:23] wasn't wasn't that way win
[01:30:27] yes but um yeah this will be a good
[01:30:29] match between yinja and Shir I'm not
[01:30:31] sure good I'm not sure how good shajir
[01:30:33] is um but it seems like the Mongolian
[01:30:35] team is very good at the images yes
[01:30:37] Nelson what did they do during this
[01:30:39] period so he's ready but he's not so we
[01:30:41] give each of the competitors a moment to
[01:30:43] compose himself he's just clicked ready
[01:30:46] um and we want everybody to be ready so
[01:30:48] that we could start the match
[01:30:49] simultaneously for all four um tables
[01:30:54] let me grab this chair here and that's
[01:30:56] Alex Mullen right there y he's quick at
[01:30:59] images as
[01:31:00] well I'm going get cozy here oh hey
[01:31:03] what's going on got the big guy at the
[01:31:05] table this is excited yeah is this to
[01:31:08] watch this right so
[01:31:11] um they have started just look how
[01:31:14] quickly Simon goes through those
[01:31:15] pictures it's just a quick
[01:31:17] glance what is that a quarter of a
[01:31:19] second it's
[01:31:21] incredible per image
[01:31:26] Johnny's keeping no he's not the same
[01:31:28] pce oh wow look at this feature I didn't
[01:31:29] see that so you can see yeah exactly how
[01:31:32] quickly they're doing how quickly
[01:31:33] they're downloading the information
[01:31:34] table 4 of um Shir and yja they're doing
[01:31:38] at the same Pace wow
[01:31:40] almost wow table four janja just got
[01:31:45] 18.3 seconds s in 19 seconds and Everett
[01:31:49] a newcomer 15 years old 19 seconds 15
[01:31:52] just turned 15 yesterday now the
[01:31:53] question is do they get it right right
[01:31:56] right I mean I'm sure you could do it in
[01:31:57] a few seconds but you probably get I
[01:31:59] don't know about that maybe the first
[01:32:00] one right thanks thanks Nelson are there
[01:32:03] are there still images in in the in the
[01:32:05] pool that are duplicates duplicates
[01:32:08] which are just slightly different oh no
[01:32:11] we I
[01:32:12] mean there have been duplicates I think
[01:32:15] there was one no in the names one I
[01:32:17] think someone complained that there was
[01:32:19] a duplicate face but I think they were
[01:32:21] actually twins right cuz it was slightly
[01:32:23] different and not not like a different
[01:32:25] angle on the same person it was like
[01:32:27] it's like a trick you looked at his face
[01:32:28] and you could say like okay it looks
[01:32:29] like him a lot but I think it's a twin
[01:32:32] yeah so because I remember there was
[01:32:34] this one image in in the images
[01:32:36] discipline that was the same image but a
[01:32:40] few pixels more to the left or something
[01:32:42] like that interesting okay yeah Johnny's
[01:32:45] recalling it really quickly interesting
[01:32:48] yeah well he's took a little more time
[01:32:50] so Simon that's the thing when you go so
[01:32:53] fast under 20 seconds it's you know
[01:32:56] you're you're really and you're right A
[01:32:58] lot of these images are pretty random
[01:33:01] yeah I mean it's all sorts it's it's
[01:33:04] basically memorizing words but without
[01:33:05] the words right right you just pick what
[01:33:09] you see there and if it's a very heavy
[01:33:11] scenery then you just pick the first
[01:33:13] thing that pops your attention whatever
[01:33:15] notice you notice right is it the record
[01:33:18] last year is 14 well yeah the world
[01:33:21] record which was set last year was 14.4
[01:33:23] and we are well CC has the
[01:33:27] 14.8 top score of the day I don't know
[01:33:30] if you've told the viewers though the
[01:33:31] best score of the first day in each of
[01:33:33] the events gets a $2,000 yep prize so
[01:33:37] there's there is something in getting
[01:33:38] the top score that's that's why probably
[01:33:42] U we had some disappointment in Yan
[01:33:44] Hendrick's attempt earlier when he did
[01:33:45] the 26 the name there at the record he
[01:33:48] didn't look too happy about winning
[01:33:51] against everyone else in the room in
[01:33:52] that moment so nobody has yet to get a
[01:33:55] perfect name score in competition um and
[01:33:59] I guess he was going for that with the
[01:34:01] full 60 seconds a lot of people the
[01:34:03] previous time had gone in the 50s right
[01:34:05] right I think yja had 50c or Alex had a
[01:34:08] 50c attempt yja set a record but it
[01:34:12] wasn't the full correct and she did in
[01:34:14] less time right we have two minutes left
[01:34:16] and some people already completed it so
[01:34:18] marwin just beat Sanjay s um nice
[01:34:24] and so Alex hit his oh he took the full
[01:34:27] 60 seconds we'll see see filling in his
[01:34:31] he's having a bit of trouble he's at
[01:34:34] 23 yeah aett has already see the mistake
[01:34:37] he made there usually you'll see maybe
[01:34:39] someone makes a swap of two but here
[01:34:41] he's got the wrong completely wrong yeah
[01:34:43] yeah so that means he's mixed up where
[01:34:45] he's placed his uh is that to come no I
[01:34:49] mean sometimes he may he may be thinking
[01:34:51] right now okay I'm not quite sure and he
[01:34:53] may change it at the last second but um
[01:34:56] usually when it's this far off it's it's
[01:34:58] it's a bit of a a sign that he may not
[01:35:00] get
[01:35:02] it and yinja gets hers that's impressive
[01:35:06] 1830 oh she's still going it's still
[01:35:10] going and she looks like she's in good
[01:35:12] shape oh wait she switched it around
[01:35:18] yep Shier is 24 and 59 that's like it
[01:35:22] looks like yours she's gonna win
[01:35:25] this so I've asked you this before um
[01:35:28] Floren but who's your favorite to win
[01:35:31] well Marvin vonius from Sweden
[01:35:35] because first of all he has steadily
[01:35:39] improved drastically over the last few
[01:35:42] years he is so dedicated to become the
[01:35:45] best in the world um he is training
[01:35:49] every
[01:35:50] day when when he goes to University in
[01:35:52] the train he he he practices for 30
[01:35:55] minutes when he comes back home he
[01:35:56] practices amazing um he is very calm
[01:36:02] competitor very relaxed I think it's
[01:36:04] very important to win if you are if you
[01:36:06] are stressed out this is always really
[01:36:09] bad for you also we saw at the world
[01:36:12] memory championships last year we
[01:36:14] mentioned this earlier he was in the
[01:36:15] lead nine out of 10 disciplines and in
[01:36:17] the last round Alex surpassed him so so
[01:36:21] he was close to becoming the world
[01:36:23] memory champ ion I have he has several
[01:36:26] really impressive world records and here
[01:36:29] we go and that round is over round Sala
[01:36:32] Alex took his time and he beat Everett
[01:36:34] Chu
[01:36:36] 3023 yeah and he wasn't able tot those
[01:36:40] mistakes he had back he knew the Young
[01:36:43] Gun what couldn't do it wow and Johnny
[01:36:45] could have had the chance to beat Simon
[01:36:47] right there uh Simon couldn't score his
[01:36:50] completely and Johnny took a little
[01:36:51] longer and he just swapped right oh what
[01:36:54] a shame and if we look at the groups we
[01:36:57] see we have now three people with nine
[01:37:00] points yanas is an elite with nine
[01:37:02] points in group a Marvin is an elite in
[01:37:06] group C with nine points winning all his
[01:37:08] three matches so far and Yan as well
[01:37:11] with nine
[01:37:13] points deated that's and your guy Mar
[01:37:16] that's giving them a really good heads
[01:37:18] up but um nothing is set in stone yet so
[01:37:22] yeah there's a lot
[01:37:24] play exactly 15 in total for every
[01:37:27] competitor is Right y we're
[01:37:30] basically one fifth of the way there
[01:37:32] there's a lot to play yeah but you know
[01:37:35] keep in mind every competitor has their
[01:37:38] strong suit and they may have already
[01:37:39] played one of those matches that that's
[01:37:41] their best won and lost for example Alex
[01:37:44] had um an upset in his numbers uh he
[01:37:47] just messed up one little three digigit
[01:37:49] section and Shir who was against him um
[01:37:53] took his time and and got the perfect ad
[01:37:55] right that's very interesting I we we
[01:37:57] see in group D which is which is a
[01:37:59] really tough group now that the current
[01:38:02] world memory Champion is not on the top
[01:38:06] position yeah so it doesn't really
[01:38:08] matter where you come from um there are
[01:38:12] always people who can beat you there
[01:38:14] that's that's what makes it also so
[01:38:16] exciting it's not really predictable
[01:38:19] although I still hope that Marvin wins
[01:38:20] so I can make a point there at the end
[01:38:22] you think over time you know the top
[01:38:24] guys will do what they're supposed to do
[01:38:27] right but um obviously there are upsets
[01:38:30] that can happen and that's the nature of
[01:38:31] this type of tournament this is this a
[01:38:33] point where you guys just really just
[01:38:35] practice and build up first couple of
[01:38:36] matches I think I think that's also part
[01:38:39] of it is these guys get into their
[01:38:41] stride um you know you saw the first
[01:38:43] round of cards they were all kind of
[01:38:46] safe times I think um and you'll see as
[01:38:49] the day goes on also depending on their
[01:38:51] position and what's in stake that
[01:38:52] they'll Maybe go for it a little more
[01:38:54] right I just want to talk to you cuz
[01:38:55] you're the founder so why why did you
[01:38:57] create xmt extreme memory tournament
[01:39:00] yeah so I started the xmt it was an idea
[01:39:03] that I had had for a while um you know
[01:39:06] you I don't know if I had a a lunch with
[01:39:09] um what's his
[01:39:11] name I
[01:39:13] forget Ray Keen I'm sorry um and it was
[01:39:16] at a UK Championship you may have been
[01:39:19] there I don't remember 2011
[01:39:23] no or 2012 maybe no I've been there 2009
[01:39:27] anyways he took me out to lunch because
[01:39:29] he wanted to hear my ideas I had voiced
[01:39:32] them to him and um so we talked
[01:39:35] something about this I had always
[01:39:36] mentioned I had mentioned you know I
[01:39:38] want I want memory Sports to be like a
[01:39:40] tennis match where people sit down they
[01:39:43] go back and forth they're really excited
[01:39:44] they support and and follow the athletes
[01:39:47] and you know these big tournaments the
[01:39:49] opens on the first days you can like
[01:39:51] kind of wander around and watch
[01:39:53] different matches between some of the
[01:39:54] Lesser known ones some of the top ones
[01:39:56] and then eventually you know go to the
[01:39:58] Grand Stadium um to watch the the the
[01:40:01] finals right between do and feder or
[01:40:04] whatever and uh so but that never went
[01:40:07] anywhere thankfully and um I ended up
[01:40:10] doing research with Washington
[01:40:12] University um Ben did a a a test battery
[01:40:15] of memory tests for them they're doing
[01:40:17] some research project on memory athletes
[01:40:20] and um I was like I want to do that so I
[01:40:23] went over there they paid me which was
[01:40:24] great did all these tests who was
[01:40:26] involved in research and I told them
[01:40:28] that I was interested in in doing a
[01:40:30] memory competition and it would be a
[01:40:31] cool way to get all these memory guys in
[01:40:33] one spot and they were like okay that's
[01:40:35] cool let's pitch it to our our the
[01:40:37] person who funds our research Dart which
[01:40:39] is where we are and before I knew it I
[01:40:41] was like actually figuring out the rules
[01:40:44] of a competition very vague structure
[01:40:47] and we flew out here had a meeting they
[01:40:49] loved it then the next thing was to find
[01:40:51] someone to build software
[01:40:54] um I reached out to actually uh Michael
[01:40:57] right um at first but he was it was a
[01:40:59] bit expensive we didn't have that much
[01:41:01] of a budget to to build it out and and
[01:41:03] Simon was the other one he had done this
[01:41:05] OMC an online memory challenge um so I
[01:41:09] said hey do you want to put this
[01:41:11] together you know and he was all for it
[01:41:13] and Simon is the co-founder and he wrote
[01:41:15] all this beautiful software uh he's a
[01:41:17] four-time Australian Champion oh and so
[01:41:21] after that the rest is history the right
[01:41:23] decision I think because this software
[01:41:25] is really it's easy for us it's great
[01:41:29] yeah it's fantastic for the people out
[01:41:31] that they can basically follow the
[01:41:32] entire thing and click everywhere follow
[01:41:35] everything it's it's easy to use inter
[01:41:38] it doesn't it and also the technology of
[01:41:41] the of the website I I find very
[01:41:43] interesting because it doesn't reload it
[01:41:45] doesn't load pages when you go there I
[01:41:47] think it's using a thing called ax where
[01:41:50] you just click and it will load it into
[01:41:53] the page without recreating the entire
[01:41:55] page which is very clever and helpful
[01:41:58] many websites don't do that because it
[01:42:00] doesn't create a new click I see but we
[01:42:03] don't you don't need clicks for that so
[01:42:05] this is really nice it's a nice
[01:42:06] technology so what I wanted to say kind
[01:42:08] of to some of that long story is the
[01:42:09] reason I started it is because I wanted
[01:42:11] to create a memory competition that was
[01:42:13] exciting to watch that had more at stake
[01:42:16] for the competitors and was more like a
[01:42:17] sport rather than a test right right and
[01:42:20] that's what this is has it's fastpac
[01:42:23] it's exciting and it's not and you have
[01:42:25] the strategy uh component and the sport
[01:42:28] feel to it you know and I love seeing
[01:42:30] all these stats I think that's
[01:42:31] fascinating rather than just like
[01:42:33] numbers that represent your score and
[01:42:35] that's it you know yeah and you it's
[01:42:37] great with the world records it's quick
[01:42:39] yeah exactly can you tell us a little
[01:42:41] bit about no details but about the first
[01:42:44] surprise events when when does it start
[01:42:47] what does this I I can reveal I mean I
[01:42:49] don't know if you saw that um but before

[00:05:24] and we ran out of what you're the ones

[00:05:44] years I forgot how cheap gases

=== Nelson Dellis' MIND SHOW - Scott Flansburg // The Human Calculator ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y_MMK9Gkq0

[00:00:24] all right thank you everybody for coming
[00:00:26] and watching this interview with the
[00:00:28] famous awesome stop Flensburg aka the
[00:00:32] human calculator really excited to speak
[00:00:35] to you I you know I met you just a few
[00:00:37] months ago in Central Park we had a
[00:00:39] awesome lunch just sitting on a rock in
[00:00:41] Central Park the weather was amazing
[00:00:44] and I had been waiting to meet you for
[00:00:46] years as I you know I met you sneer we
[00:00:50] had before on the show and you know I've
[00:00:53] always been into memory and math so I
[00:00:56] know about you and this is great to have
[00:00:59] you here so I guess I have a few
[00:01:02] questions to ask you about different
[00:01:04] things you're involved with I guess
[00:01:06] first of all congrats on your your show
[00:01:08] on the the History Channel how's that
[00:01:10] going Wow unbelievable thank you very
[00:01:12] much it just came out and four episodes
[00:01:15] there just last weekend twice those
[00:01:17] eight hour marathon in history - and
[00:01:20] History Channel we're really excited and
[00:01:22] our production company and base
[00:01:24] productions John Brenkus unbelievable
[00:01:26] and took us a while to shoot it but
[00:01:28] hopefully they're gonna order some more
[00:01:30] well let you know as soon as I know yeah
[00:01:32] that's good we'll put links so that
[00:01:33] people can check it out so let's let's
[00:01:37] talk about you like what's I know your
[00:01:39] story but for people out there what's
[00:01:40] your background how did you get into
[00:01:42] math and what what is it that you are
[00:01:44] what are you known for yeah well I'm in
[00:01:47] the Guinness Book of Records as the
[00:01:49] fastest human calculator for this thing
[00:01:51] that I do where I count by a number so
[00:01:54] like let's say I picked 24 yeah so if
[00:01:56] you had to do 24 plus 24 plus 24 just
[00:01:59] keep saying the answer out loud as fast
[00:02:01] as you could for 15 seconds how many
[00:02:05] answers do you think you could get I
[00:02:07] don't know it depends on the number 24
[00:02:10] yeah maybe
[00:02:12] in 15 seconds maybe give five I don't
[00:02:14] know all right so this one it sounds
[00:02:16] like 24 48 72 96 120 144 168 192 216 240
[00:02:24] like that so you know the number just
[00:02:26] keeps counting up so nearly slow right
[00:02:28] you're going slow very slow I wanted to
[00:02:30] make sure everybody understands just
[00:02:31] what I'm actually doing before I do it
[00:02:33] and so it's just counting by a number
[00:02:36] for 15 seconds and the Guinness folks
[00:02:38] found just really fast a accountant with
[00:02:40] a 10 key and so the judge chose the
[00:02:43] number 38 so I had to add 38 plus 38 and
[00:02:46] he had to do three eight plus three plus
[00:02:49] three on his calculator as fast as he
[00:02:51] could and at the end of the fifteen
[00:02:52] seconds he had 28 answers and I had 35
[00:02:55] so I can almost do my average about two
[00:02:58] and a half answers per second when I'm
[00:03:01] going full speed so go ahead and pick a
[00:03:03] random two-digit number and I'll just
[00:03:05] start counting but do it okay let's see
[00:03:08] my favorite number
[00:03:10] well that's know let's try something a
[00:03:12] little high let's say 63 one two six 189
[00:03:16] 252 315 378 four four one five oh four
[00:03:19] five six seven six reow
[00:03:20] six nine three seven five six eight one
[00:03:22] nine eighty to ninety four five one zero
[00:03:23] zero eight one zero seven one one one
[00:03:25] three four one two six Oh like that was
[00:03:27] 21 times in probably 10 seconds so I
[00:03:30] just get tuned in to the number notes is
[00:03:32] freaky because as soon as you said 63 my
[00:03:35] brain just goes into this I don't want
[00:03:38] to say trance but it's almost like you
[00:03:40] can't knock me off that vision that that
[00:03:42] that idea yeah and my brain just gets so
[00:03:44] tuned into it what actually slows me
[00:03:46] down there's my mouth
[00:03:47] my brain is going so fast then my mouth
[00:03:50] actually slows me down so the tricky
[00:03:51] part is synchronizing those two and one
[00:03:54] of the questions that I first asked you
[00:03:56] because being a memory guy I was like
[00:03:57] are you doing this or how do you
[00:04:00] memorize them and then you were telling
[00:04:01] me that somebody had asked you that
[00:04:03] before and actually you disprove them
[00:04:05] right yeah great thanks for asking that
[00:04:08] because especially with all the memory
[00:04:09] guys you have in girls listening people
[00:04:12] might think there's a memory to it
[00:04:14] I don't memorize anything when you said
[00:04:16] 63 I might have done that number a dozen
[00:04:18] times in my life but I don't remember
[00:04:20] any of them I just it's too easy to
[00:04:22] calculate
[00:04:23] stead of memorizing so the Guinness
[00:04:26] folks thought I had cheated and actually
[00:04:28] memorized all the two-digit numbers up
[00:04:30] to like a thousand or something whatever
[00:04:31] couldn't he do a bowl like that's the
[00:04:34] way I would probably do it and I could
[00:04:36] you could write good but it would be a
[00:04:39] lot of work and there's not a logic to
[00:04:42] it you're creating connections to make
[00:04:45] it logical but to me it just adds up
[00:04:47] like it can't be any other thing so it's
[00:04:50] beyond memorization logic defies
[00:04:52] memorization if you will so the Guinness
[00:04:55] folks were like hey can you prove to us
[00:04:57] do you just didn't memorize counting by
[00:04:58] 63 or 38 and so I said all right well
[00:05:01] when you turn on the calculator it
[00:05:02] always starts at zero so instead of
[00:05:04] starting at zero pick a totally random
[00:05:06] like three-digit number and I'll use
[00:05:09] that as my zero and start from there and
[00:05:10] then count by 63 or whatever so go ahead
[00:05:13] pick a random three-digit number I'm
[00:05:14] closing my eyes and they'll so everybody
[00:05:16] knows that I'm not cheating or you know
[00:05:18] I have a friend helping me or something
[00:05:20] so any three-digit number yeah just a
[00:05:22] random three-digit number that will be
[00:05:23] our new zero all right let's say 234 2 3
[00:05:26] 2 3 4 now what - did you never want me
[00:05:28] to count by starting at 234 I promised
[00:05:30] you Nelson I have never practiced or
[00:05:32] done this before starting in 234 what do
[00:05:35] you already count by let's go by 19 - 5
[00:05:38] 3 - 7 - 2 9 1 3 10 3 2 9 3 4 8 3 6 7 3 8
[00:05:42] 6 4 o 5 4 - 4 4 4 3 4 6 before anyone
[00:05:44] 500 like that fast as I could think you
[00:05:47] know and talk so love it it's a gift I I
[00:05:51] couldn't have practiced this numbers
[00:05:53] just make total sense to my brain and
[00:05:54] it's giving me insights to help people
[00:05:57] better understand numbers so that's
[00:05:58] where I've made my living to let past 25
[00:06:00] years as an author or speaker having
[00:06:03] videos things like that started in
[00:06:05] infomercials and now to the History
[00:06:07] Channel level is just a dream come true
[00:06:09] you know just for guys like you have
[00:06:11] made it be able to have an impact on the
[00:06:13] planet not just sharing or showing off
[00:06:15] our gift more importantly showing people
[00:06:17] how they can apply to their everyday
[00:06:19] lives and make their lives better
[00:06:21] yeah so let me ask you because I've
[00:06:23] always a lot of the people I talked to
[00:06:25] or in my world are trained right like
[00:06:28] you sneer he's obviously talented but
[00:06:30] he's trained and same with me after
[00:06:32] train but it seems like I mean this is
[00:06:34] gift but how do you I mean there must
[00:06:38] learn it could I get to your level or is
[00:06:42] it is it something totally different I I
[00:06:45] don't think you know I don't want to say
[00:06:48] no because I've run into a few people
[00:06:50] that have walked up to me and challenged
[00:06:51] me to count by a number and it's say
[00:06:53] they can do it just as quickly so I'm
[00:06:55] sure we're gonna run into a few kids and
[00:06:57] out there that once they know that it's
[00:06:59] okay to count by a number and get time
[00:07:01] to see if it's worthy of a world record
[00:07:03] maybe that'll inspire more kids to start
[00:07:05] counting by numbers that's why my
[00:07:06] programs program is called I count I
[00:07:09] want to use numbers as a way to not only
[00:07:11] teach kids how to think about numbers
[00:07:13] properly and do math but more
[00:07:15] importantly to use numbers as a way to
[00:07:16] increase their self-esteem so I count
[00:07:19] and it's not a coincidence that I count
[00:07:21] for a living I just can count by numbers
[00:07:23] so I don't try to teach people how to
[00:07:25] count by numbers really quickly I try to
[00:07:27] teach people how to understand numbers
[00:07:29] better and simple strategies to deal
[00:07:31] with basic arithmetic in everyday life
[00:07:32] cuz I mean that's where that skill
[00:07:35] probably comes from from I don't know
[00:07:37] your upbringing but I would guess that
[00:07:38] from a young age you were you had a good
[00:07:42] number sense yeah yeah I was in third
[00:07:45] grade
[00:07:45] and my teacher picked me to vote to the
[00:07:47] board and at the time I could care less
[00:07:49] about math I was totally into sports and
[00:07:51] I had to add up a call of numbers and it
[00:07:54] was when we first learned how to carry
[00:07:56] and I wasn't paying attention I did it
[00:07:58] backwards I did it left to right I just
[00:08:00] put 10 20 30 40 added it up and I said
[00:08:03] the answer is just like what how did you
[00:08:04] do that and I showed her and she goes no
[00:08:06] no no you got to go the other way and I
[00:08:07] was like well it's easier this way so
[00:08:09] not only did I learn how to add quickly
[00:08:12] in that day but more importantly is what
[00:08:13] see was planted in my brain that day was
[00:08:16] maybe teachers don't know everything
[00:08:18] maybe they're just teaching what they
[00:08:20] know the best they can but maybe there
[00:08:22] are better ways to get the answer out
[00:08:23] there so from third grade on everything
[00:08:26] I learned I would sit there and try to
[00:08:27] figure out an easier way to get the
[00:08:29] answer yeah yeah I mean it's a shame I
[00:08:33] mean growing up and I did physics and
[00:08:36] math those were my majors and well I
[00:08:38] remember being in that getting so I was
[00:08:41] already good at numbers and mental
[00:08:42] calculations not like your level but
[00:08:44] enough in that field and even the
[00:08:47] the teachers we had and stuff like in
[00:08:49] the room full of these guys like I
[00:08:50] remember how we all had really good
[00:08:52] number sense and how big a difference it
[00:08:55] is and how crazy it is that a lot of
[00:08:57] people in America at least are afraid of
[00:08:59] numbers it's just it's not it's really
[00:09:02] bad it's become socially accepted yeah
[00:09:05] bad at math I do national television
[00:09:07] shows like you where they start the
[00:09:10] interview with hey I'm really bad at
[00:09:12] math so I'm like whoa wait a minute you
[00:09:14] just pulled
[00:09:14] millions of people listening then even
[00:09:17] though you're making tons of money and
[00:09:18] national recognition you have to do no
[00:09:21] math and that's not true I'm gonna show
[00:09:23] you how to use math and everyday life
[00:09:24] right now even if you think you're bad
[00:09:25] at it so I'm trying to dispel that myth
[00:09:27] too and try to make it cool to be good
[00:09:30] at numbers to be a mathlete if you want
[00:09:32] that's cool what is uh so I was a few
[00:09:38] years ago you were you kept posting
[00:09:40] every day on Facebook your calendar day
[00:09:42] I thought this was really cool so you
[00:09:45] have your own calendar you're trying to
[00:09:46] push right and tell me yes thanks for
[00:09:49] noticing now that makes my whole day I
[00:09:51] mean I love the math stuff I do but this
[00:09:54] calendar started as a novelty at y2k
[00:09:56] time and I just
[00:09:57] why not use a 13-month calendar with 28
[00:09:59] days of every month and this one day it
[00:10:02] inspired me to use zero
[00:10:04] as a number in counting the days so
[00:10:06] there's a zero day a zero month is zero
[00:10:08] year and it just sort of makes a 365 day
[00:10:11] here add up perfectly where every dates
[00:10:13] also the same day of the week every
[00:10:15] month it would make our lives beyond
[00:10:17] simple and so I just sort of threw it
[00:10:20] out there and now in episode 4 of my
[00:10:22] show on the History Channel that we
[00:10:24] actually have a whole segment about my
[00:10:26] calendar while visiting the atomic clock
[00:10:28] in Boulder Colorado so I'm gonna give it
[00:10:32] a shot I'm introducing it officially
[00:10:33] next year 2017 because the trick is no
[00:10:37] so I need a Monday a Sunday as January
[00:10:40] 1st so every year thousands 17th every
[00:10:44] year would start on a Sunday no I just
[00:10:47] needed oh whoa oh you're gonna start on
[00:10:49] a sunny to synchronize so that my one
[00:10:51] days are always on a mundane of truká
[00:10:53] just sort of show off the efficiency of
[00:10:54] my calendar that'll be cool so yeah
[00:10:57] thanks for bringing that up it Santa
[00:10:59] if it's a fun project it's a big idea I
[00:11:01] know but it's a lot of fun that's cool
[00:11:03] and then so something that I'm really
[00:11:05] excited about because it taps into my
[00:11:07] memory world is the memoria ad
[00:11:09] competition for those who don't know
[00:11:11] it's every I believe four years or two
[00:11:14] years four years three or four years
[00:11:16] like the Olympics for mental sports yeah
[00:11:18] so it combines the stuff you do the the
[00:11:21] mental calculation and then memory as
[00:11:23] well and there's all these disciplines
[00:11:25] against competing both or just your own
[00:11:28] side of things but right this year is
[00:11:31] gonna be in Vegas and it's if you want
[00:11:35] to tell I don't know if it's its public
[00:11:37] yet the sponsor go for it yeah some good
[00:11:40] news but he does have that Zappos right
[00:11:45] and says has come along and they're huge
[00:11:48] in Vegas and huge in general and so
[00:11:51] that's gonna be really exciting what are
[00:11:53] the dates again November 7 through 11
[00:11:56] it's Monday through Friday November 7th
[00:11:59] will be the welcoming day 8 9 and 10 or
[00:12:01] competitions big party the night of the
[00:12:02] 10th and 11th we're gonna do some fun
[00:12:05] things because it's actually a Veterans
[00:12:06] Day here in America and Ron Wade is a
[00:12:09] friend of yours does this amazing wall
[00:12:12] for memory about the Afghanistan sort of
[00:12:14] service people so we really want to
[00:12:16] bring it all together on Friday that
[00:12:18] November 11th to not only show off
[00:12:20] everybody's amazing skills but to also
[00:12:23] show how a guy like Ron incorporated his
[00:12:25] gift to help and support others in his
[00:12:29] community and in the world so he's a
[00:12:31] great example of that I love that thing
[00:12:33] he does with incredible mesmerizing I
[00:12:37] actually got to witness it he did it in
[00:12:39] Arizona Diamondbacks baseball game to
[00:12:43] watch the families come up to the wall
[00:12:45] crying and touching their families
[00:12:47] members day I mean it was really surreal
[00:12:49] that he he came up with that and it's
[00:12:51] got such a huge impact yeah yeah that's
[00:12:54] great but yeah the composition will be
[00:12:57] exciting if anybody's interested it's I
[00:13:00] guess more yet calm
[00:13:02] yeah yeah and here's what's playing
[00:13:04] houses when I first saw memory ad I call
[00:13:07] it memory add or memoria and I called it
[00:13:11] both ways for a long time and then it
[00:13:13] hit me that it's all about memories so
[00:13:14] it just starts with memory and memory
[00:13:17] every add oh right
[00:13:19] okay and there's there's gonna be 11
[00:13:21] categories plus speed reading we're
[00:13:23] going to throw in there too and we're
[00:13:25] also looking for amazing savants from
[00:13:27] around the world to come to Las Vegas
[00:13:29] just so to help us celebrate this mental
[00:13:32] athlete thing we're really going to make
[00:13:34] it cool it's going to be a huge
[00:13:35] documentary were filming everything
[00:13:37] Zappos is going to use a bunch of the
[00:13:39] mental athletes coming in from around
[00:13:40] the world and stories on their website -
[00:13:43] normally promote their brands and
[00:13:44] business but also to promote mental
[00:13:46] athletes that's cool man I'll be there I
[00:13:48] will try to win the thing or I try to
[00:13:50] win the memory stuff at least yeah yeah
[00:13:52] I would love to see you trying to do the
[00:13:53] counting thing come on yeah you know I
[00:13:55] might just try that the calculation
[00:13:57] stuff just for shits and giggles but
[00:14:00] yeah we'll just you know I've invented a
[00:14:03] thing called a counting B it's like you
[00:14:04] know the spelling bee and a lot of kids
[00:14:06] memorize a lot of those words but the
[00:14:08] spelling bee is an amazing competition
[00:14:12] it's 80 years I think so
[00:14:13] well the counting bee is going to be
[00:14:15] introduced at Memory antis you're in Las
[00:14:17] Vegas everybody's gonna get their 15
[00:14:18] seconds of fame to count by a random
[00:14:21] number let's see you get a count by 24
[00:14:23] seven here's the different
[00:14:24] differentiator you get up there and say
[00:14:27] all right Nelson you got to start you
[00:14:28] gotta count by 24 but you have to start
[00:14:30] at a random number like 37 so I'm pretty
[00:14:33] able to count by the same number it's a
[00:14:34] fair contest but what'll prize a cash
[00:14:37] prize for whoever could do the best
[00:14:39] really all right yeah so we all get we
[00:14:41] all have to count by the same number but
[00:14:43] we may have to start in different places
[00:14:45] that makes it fair because you know 24
[00:14:48] is tough number to count by but if you
[00:14:50] start at 38 somebody else starts with 16
[00:14:52] or 18 that random number makes it fair
[00:14:54] for everybody to do the same thing okay
[00:14:56] yeah thank you and I really want to make
[00:14:59] it a sport you know mounting is the
[00:15:01] basic sport it's like walking and
[00:15:04] running to be able to do a flex form
[00:15:06] athletics you have to be able to do
[00:15:07] numbers and basic counting and basic
[00:15:09] arithmetic so this is what I want to
[00:15:10] celebrate with the counting but let me
[00:15:13] ask
[00:15:13] so because I have a friend who is he's
[00:15:16] into something else but he happens to be
[00:15:18] really good specifically at counting up
[00:15:20] dominoes like okay if someone can lay
[00:15:23] them out and he could just go like this
[00:15:24] and he knows the sum of all the dots
[00:15:26] right Wow
[00:15:27] yeah and he doesn't you know it's a
[00:15:29] similar thing is you it's just like it's
[00:15:31] a feeling it's a sense are you so my
[00:15:34] question is is you know you can do this
[00:15:36] Guinness record of counting but in
[00:15:38] general you can do sums pretty quick
[00:15:41] right like you're good with numbers
[00:15:42] another yeah yeah or when I met you
[00:15:46] sneer sort of freaks me out when I
[00:15:47] realized there were people out there
[00:15:48] training every day for hours I was like
[00:15:51] what I haven't never practiced once ever
[00:15:53] in my life
[00:15:54] this is I go play golf you know so it
[00:16:00] was amazing to see the sense of urgency
[00:16:01] created all these students and kids that
[00:16:03] I've met around the world that compete
[00:16:05] in these things and how much energy and
[00:16:06] time they put into it so I really want
[00:16:08] to honor that and that memory either Las
[00:16:11] Vegas we really want to celebrate all
[00:16:13] these amazing people so I'm glad you're
[00:16:16] gonna be there I hope we get as many
[00:16:17] American about mental athletes as
[00:16:19] possible there too you know because I
[00:16:21] know you just came back from China where
[00:16:23] it had to be a majority of Chinese
[00:16:24] participants correct yeah but the winner
[00:16:27] was an American which was a pretty
[00:16:29] historic so it's great well I hope he
[00:16:31] represents well here I'm really excited
[00:16:33] to have it everybody here and thank you
[00:16:35] so much for giving me this time to talk
[00:16:37] about memory add because I really want
[00:16:40] to make it a fun event we're only gonna
[00:16:41] have two hundred spots 100 for math 100
[00:16:43] for memory we're gonna make it really
[00:16:44] tough we want to bring in the best and
[00:16:47] really make just something that for
[00:16:49] years to follow people will watch the
[00:16:50] video of this event and hopefully
[00:16:52] inspire them to become a part of it
[00:16:54] that's awesome cool man before I let you
[00:16:56] go just a couple tips from you to
[00:17:00] anybody out there who watches this and
[00:17:02] says like exactly what he said before
[00:17:03] that I'm horrible at math I'm horrible
[00:17:05] at numbers how can they turn that around
[00:17:07] like simple things yeah I had a very
[00:17:10] weird day on 9 999 at 9 in the morning
[00:17:13] on the 18th hole playing golf with Alice
[00:17:17] Cooper who wrote a song called 18 and he
[00:17:19] asked me hey 18 1 plus 8 is 9
[00:17:22] today's 9 999
[00:17:24] come 18 adds up to 9 and I explained
[00:17:26] know that any number times 9 that answer
[00:17:29] will add up to 9 like 3 times 9 is 27 2
[00:17:32] + 7 is 9 4 times 9 is 36 3 + 6 is 9 he
[00:17:36] goes okay I don't care and I'm driving
[00:17:37] home and I'm thinking why why is that
[00:17:39] and I noticed this pattern about the
[00:17:41] number 9 and I believe it's going to
[00:17:42] turn on the calculator and everyone's
[00:17:44] brain so if you're watching right now
[00:17:45] please try to get this but then share it
[00:17:48] with one person your life that you think
[00:17:49] is worse as math than you ready so to
[00:17:51] turn on this calculator just picture the
[00:17:53] number 9 now picture the number 11 11
[00:17:57] has a 1 and a 1 so add the digits
[00:17:58] together one in one adds up to two so 11
[00:18:02] and take away the total to 1 11 minus 2
[00:18:05] is 9 this works for every number so try
[00:18:08] 10 1 plus 0 is 1 10 minus 1 is 9
[00:18:12] try 22 plus 0 is 220 take away 2 is 18
[00:18:18] but the answer 18 1 + 8 is 9 so
[00:18:21] everybody watching right now you're
[00:18:22] tuned else already think of your age add
[00:18:25] the two digits together yeah and now
[00:18:27] take that total and subtract that total
[00:18:30] from your age and the answer you get
[00:18:33] should be a number that adds up to none
[00:18:36] so how'd it go freedom yeah I'm 32
[00:18:38] unfortunately that's five minus five
[00:18:42] twenty seven two seven is 9 my goal is
[00:18:45] to reach every nine-year-old kid on the
[00:18:46] planet Earth so that when they're 9
[00:18:48] years old every number they see will go
[00:18:51] back to their age the number 9 it'll
[00:18:53] make them feel like every number is
[00:18:54] their friend and turned on this number a
[00:18:56] calculator in their brain and make them
[00:18:58] feel like numbers are no big deal and
[00:18:59] that'll open up the door in the window
[00:19:01] to the world of mathematics that's cool
[00:19:05] great no I appreciate all that that
[00:19:09] information that's it that's cool
[00:19:11] one one thing before you actually before
[00:19:13] you go for real ok so I'm I'm a huge fan
[00:19:17] of like the the other calculator so
[00:19:21] there's guys that can do power is really
[00:19:23] high like rüdiger gam or that's a magic
[00:19:26] trick I think is it so that's my
[00:19:28] question is a lot of these things
[00:19:31] they're impressive and he can rattle off
[00:19:33] numbers for like you say
[00:19:36] two digit number 86 to the fifth power
[00:19:38] right and then you'll just rattle off
[00:19:41] the numbers and he's doing these hand
[00:19:43] waving things it's impressive but I
[00:19:45] don't know if there's some technique to
[00:19:47] it or I hope he writes a book and
[00:19:50] explains it someday so that we all can
[00:19:51] understand the process because all I can
[00:19:54] tell you is everything I can do except
[00:19:55] for the counting by the number very
[00:19:57] quickly I teach and explain in the
[00:19:59] simplest form that I can find on the
[00:20:01] planet Earth so whatever is happening up
[00:20:04] there I know I don't know and I don't
[00:20:05] see anybody duplicating that and any
[00:20:07] time it takes somebody longer to say the
[00:20:09] answer than it does to calculate it
[00:20:11] something's up oh yeah that's my guess
[00:20:16] but the new thing for me is flash hands
[00:20:18] and you know well numbers appear on the
[00:20:20] screen and they they're like every fifth
[00:20:22] of a second or tenth of a second these
[00:20:24] guys go so fast you can barely verbalize
[00:20:27] the numbers out loud as they're flashing
[00:20:28] on the screen they're adding them all up
[00:20:30] so I haven't been trained in that medium
[00:20:32] so I'm gonna give it a trying to see how
[00:20:33] I can do but you sneers doing a great
[00:20:35] job with it already
[00:20:36] yeah they trained that right along the
[00:20:38] Sorbonne in countries like Japan and
[00:20:40] they can just do almost three-digit
[00:20:42] numbers like that right many years ago I
[00:20:45] filmed a special in Tokyo I used to live
[00:20:47] in Japan to buy some Japanese with it
[00:20:49] and I met a ten year old girl that not
[00:20:52] only could add up 23 digit numbers and
[00:20:54] half second intervals but I could ask
[00:20:57] her questions in English her second
[00:21:00] language while she was doing that
[00:21:02] towards the 20 numbers and she answered
[00:21:05] them in English while she was keeping
[00:21:08] track of the numbers on the machine and
[00:21:11] said the answer instantly when it popped
[00:21:14] up so was she using a mental like abacus
[00:21:17] yeah the cool part was is they all had
[00:21:19] an abacus understate on their desk when
[00:21:21] I walked in and they were all doing it
[00:21:22] write the answer down and then then sit
[00:21:24] the teacher goes okay everybody stop put
[00:21:26] your abacus away and continue and they
[00:21:29] just kept on going they don't even need
[00:21:31] it because it is it's all in your head
[00:21:32] though it's pretty fast that's awesome
[00:21:35] well awesome man thank you for your time
[00:21:37] really excited about the competence
[00:21:39] you have no idea that's it's rare that
[00:21:41] we get the competitions in the US but it
[00:21:44] seems to be happening more and more and
[00:21:46] I think this is that software all the
[00:21:49] time to train memory since I started
[00:21:50] this stuff so I'm very excited to see in
[00:21:54] Vegas so thank you buddy I really
[00:21:57] appreciate it I can't wait for you to
[00:21:58] get here I hope America wins but
[00:22:00] worst-case scenarios let's just put on
[00:22:02] the best exact memory event ever yeah so
[00:22:05] that people are just like this is out
[00:22:07] there and people can do this you know
[00:22:09] okay but here I'm an odds guy you know I
[00:22:12] live in Vegas so what are the odds that
[00:22:14] the person that wins your tournament
[00:22:16] this summer wins memory ID in November
[00:22:20] it's probably pretty likely okay memory
[00:22:24] side of it yeah alright well we'll
[00:22:26] discuss off swine here about our event
[00:22:28] for that yeah we got some bets on the
[00:22:31] side here except it's Vegas
[00:22:32] cool bet we'll take care of thanks for
[00:22:35] catching up and I'll see you later this
[00:22:38] year you got to choose me thanks for all
[00:22:40] you do yeah all right man thanks for
[00:22:44] that nose off

=== Nelson Dellis' MIND SHOW - Alan Arnette // K2 Mountaineer ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XWW0SfE0

[00:00:51] so hey you know I can't believe you're
[00:00:53] going back yeah me neither
[00:00:56] so okay this is this is your be on the
[00:01:01] south with Phil can you are on the north
[00:01:03] twice right the first time without the
[00:01:06] nor are you yeah exactly yeah
[00:01:10] I always thought Benton is this is gonna
[00:01:13] be for my my blog I'm using my blog too
[00:01:16] and it is a mental game too so I wanted
[00:01:19] to have you on and just nobody else
[00:01:22] knows Everest more than this guy Alan
[00:01:24] our net so thank you for joining us on
[00:01:27] this installment of my mind show but um
[00:01:31] first of all how you doing man what's
[00:01:33] what's the latest I doing well just you
[00:01:36] know out playing in my Colorado
[00:01:37] mountains trying to stay fit because you
[00:01:39] never know when when I'll go back to the
[00:01:42] ball yeah so what is the plan now what I
[00:01:45] know you had a big project well first of
[00:01:48] all I don't think I've talked to you
[00:01:49] since was it last year
[00:01:51] no 2014 right why do you summoning you
[00:01:56] know an amazing group of people I went
[00:01:58] up there and you became the oldest
[00:02:00] American I believe right - so Mikey -
[00:02:02] right on my birthday my 38th birthday
[00:02:04] you like when you say that's pretty
[00:02:06] that's an awesome AZ I followed along so
[00:02:08] closely that your blog posts were
[00:02:10] amazing and
[00:02:12] it's one of these places that Everest
[00:02:14] you can read about you can find videos
[00:02:16] but key to just seems so difficult to
[00:02:19] find information about yeah that was the
[00:02:22] reason I wanted to blog in a way that no
[00:02:25] one the least that I had never seen
[00:02:27] anyone live blog during the decline you
[00:02:30] see a lot of documentaries after the
[00:02:32] fact but you know and you know because
[00:02:34] you do a great job of blocking when
[00:02:36] you've been on Everest and so how much
[00:02:39] time it takes so it took a lot of time
[00:02:42] to do the videos to edit them and then
[00:02:45] upload them and you know then try to
[00:02:46] make a difference out there but of
[00:02:48] course I'm doing it you know help raise
[00:02:50] awareness and money around all tigers
[00:02:52] disease which I know it's very dear to
[00:02:54] you as well yeah so that's how I know
[00:02:56] Alan um I started this whole memory
[00:02:59] thing and then climbing eventually
[00:03:00] because of my grandmother about
[00:03:01] Alzheimer's she passed away in 2009 and
[00:03:04] Alan has a similar story with his mother
[00:03:07] and that's what he climbs for I mean
[00:03:11] that's you did such a great job it's
[00:03:14] that it was part of the reason you know
[00:03:16] I saw you and what you did and I was
[00:03:18] like that is something that I would like
[00:03:20] to try and do as well seems amazing well
[00:03:23] you know us all about the memories right
[00:03:25] I mean you're you're you're living proof
[00:03:27] that that our brains can be trained to
[00:03:29] to remember things that we never thought
[00:03:32] we could but on the other thing that
[00:03:34] spectrum is the disease and dementia in
[00:03:37] general that Rob's people other memories
[00:03:39] and they have no they have no chance to
[00:03:41] do anything about it and that's the
[00:03:42] problem today is that with Alzheimer's
[00:03:44] we we have no way of stopping it and no
[00:03:46] cure and it's 100% fatal so that's why I
[00:03:50] continue to do my clients trying to
[00:03:52] raise the awareness and raise money for
[00:03:54] research yeah you know I that's amazing
[00:03:57] I I was writing about it today on my
[00:03:59] blog that just like I forget sometimes
[00:04:02] why I do the memory thing and because
[00:04:04] sometimes it's just like I got a
[00:04:06] memorize car it's faster than this guy
[00:04:07] or whatever and I spent hours just by
[00:04:10] myself with a deck of cards number isn't
[00:04:12] doing so that's really impressive but
[00:04:14] ultimately what does it do for me but
[00:04:17] the bigger thing is that you know I'm
[00:04:19] training my mind obviously to do
[00:04:21] specific things but in general trying to
[00:04:24] make my mind
[00:04:26] and my life more memorable and and by
[00:04:29] training those exercises I'm kind of
[00:04:32] reliving things in my life that I
[00:04:34] remember experiences and things like
[00:04:36] that
[00:04:37] the more I go out and do things the more
[00:04:39] I could kind of relate that to the
[00:04:40] memory support stuff too you know I
[00:04:42] think it's um I talk a lot I do my
[00:04:45] talking my public speaking around
[00:04:47] passion and purpose and for me might be
[00:04:50] not my passion is mountain climbing and
[00:04:52] my purpose is being an Alzheimer's
[00:04:54] advocate and to your point about you
[00:04:57] know sitting for endless hours trying to
[00:04:59] memorize cards and train your brain well
[00:05:01] the same I don't do that when I'm out in
[00:05:03] the mountains all the time when I'm out
[00:05:05] for example when I was on k2 why I hit a
[00:05:08] huge wall as I was developing pulmonary
[00:05:11] edema and I didn't even realize it was
[00:05:13] happening to me but you know in another
[00:05:15] client I've been on when I hit that wall
[00:05:17] I go back to my purpose and that is
[00:05:20] around Alzheimer's and honoring my mom
[00:05:22] and my two aunts who died from it all
[00:05:25] the people that are impacted by this
[00:05:26] disease around the world and so I think
[00:05:28] this important to go back to your your
[00:05:30] purpose in life so that when you do hit
[00:05:33] that wall you have an ability to push on
[00:05:35] yeah yeah definitely and let's talk more
[00:05:39] about that in terms of where you go
[00:05:41] mentally when you're here because okay a
[00:05:44] lot of people maybe don't realize that
[00:05:46] mountaineering and climbing is long and
[00:05:49] boring and painful it's the only really
[00:05:53] enjoyable part of it is maybe the views
[00:05:55] sometimes but the beer at the end of the
[00:05:58] whole thing right so you got to spend a
[00:06:01] lot of time with yourself in your head
[00:06:02] while you're slogging up a steep slope
[00:06:05] you can't breathe and it's maybe an
[00:06:07] eight-hour day or more or less so where
[00:06:11] do you go mentally what do you do I mean
[00:06:13] you have to be very mentally aware and
[00:06:16] focused and strong to push yourself
[00:06:18] right yeah that's a really good really
[00:06:20] good point a lot of people ask me so
[00:06:21] what's the hardest part about trying to
[00:06:23] climb Everest then and I try to get
[00:06:25] beyond the normal you know physical and
[00:06:27] and altitude and things that most people
[00:06:30] can talk about but you know boredom is a
[00:06:33] really it's a really major issue and I
[00:06:35] there are companies now that are
[00:06:37] marketing speed ascents and you know
[00:06:39] trying to cut it in half and you know
[00:06:41] those are all legitimate ways of trying
[00:06:44] to shorten it but for me for me I try to
[00:06:48] live in a moment and I try to cherish
[00:06:49] the fact that I'm in a place and very
[00:06:51] few people ever get to go even though
[00:06:54] you know the popular culture talks about
[00:06:57] how crowded Everest is and how everybody
[00:06:59] has climbed Everest the reality is that
[00:07:02] is out of what's our world population 7
[00:07:05] billion yeah that there's 4,000 people
[00:07:09] so I don't know what the math is but
[00:07:11] there's a whole lot of zeros after that
[00:07:13] does this place yeah so when we're there
[00:07:15] at every Space Camp you know where I
[00:07:18] know we're gonna in Tallinn ground both
[00:07:20] literally and figuratively we're in a
[00:07:22] place that very few people ever get a
[00:07:24] chance to go and I'll guarantee you many
[00:07:26] many people dream of it so for me is
[00:07:29] just cherishing that moment I love to be
[00:07:31] with my teammates you know the
[00:07:33] camaraderie
[00:07:34] we're just taking a walk around you know
[00:07:36] around the base of the Koon boo ice wall
[00:07:38] I'm looking up and visualizing what you
[00:07:41] know those early Swiss expeditions must
[00:07:43] have been like or even back in the early
[00:07:45] 20s when Mallory walked over there
[00:07:47] trying to find a route to go what I mean
[00:07:49] if you came over there you looked up
[00:07:51] Mesa forget this you know there's no way
[00:07:53] to summit hours from this site nice
[00:07:55] three tonight he went over to the north
[00:07:57] you know there's so much history around
[00:07:59] that mountain so that's where my mind
[00:08:01] goes you're the down part yeah and then
[00:08:03] when you're on a steep slope and it's
[00:08:06] it's a long way to go and you go put one
[00:08:08] foot after the other slowly
[00:08:10] what are you doing your head I mean are
[00:08:11] you talking to yourself are you doing
[00:08:16] math are you thinking about something
[00:08:19] like delicious food what's going on
[00:08:21] you know I focus on the mechanics I tend
[00:08:25] to get lost in the mechanics of short
[00:08:29] simple steps of moving efficiently when
[00:08:33] I was when I was summiting Everest in
[00:08:35] 2011 I was just unbelievably fortunate
[00:08:38] to be with Conny Sherpa and he was he
[00:08:41] was ahead of me
[00:08:42] and I was following him and I was look I
[00:08:45] was watching him and how gracefully he
[00:08:48] moved Cal efficiently he moved as you
[00:08:51] know his feet I bet you never went 2
[00:08:53] inches off of the ground
[00:08:54] his crampon points because as he moved
[00:08:57] it was just this unbelievable ballet of
[00:09:01] graceful movement that didn't waste one
[00:09:03] ounce of energy and as I watched him do
[00:09:06] that I took that in I said ok I'm gonna
[00:09:09] do the same thing because I have a
[00:09:11] finite amount of energy and I need to
[00:09:13] conserve every single moment but also
[00:09:16] you know again cherishing the moment
[00:09:19] looking around and seeing stars that
[00:09:21] you've never seen before the skies are
[00:09:23] so clear and you know and then thinking
[00:09:25] also about you know the mechanics of
[00:09:27] hydration and you know what was last
[00:09:29] time I had a GU or whatever it is so I
[00:09:32] really I really an in the moment and I'm
[00:09:34] not trying to do you know mental
[00:09:36] exercises I'm not that smart Nelson so
[00:09:41] through the day that's good I mean it's
[00:09:45] cool to hear you say that thinking back
[00:09:46] on my summit days on Everest in 2011 at
[00:09:49] 13 I did the complete opposite of that
[00:09:52] I remember just I hurled myself up you
[00:09:55] know I do like quick bursts and then
[00:09:58] just be like okay I gotta get to that
[00:10:00] rock as fast as possible and then I'll
[00:10:02] rest and I think that that that screwed
[00:10:05] me a little bit you know I am patient
[00:10:08] but I feel like maybe not that patient
[00:10:11] hopefully a little more now but yeah
[00:10:14] you're right there's a lot of stuff to
[00:10:16] be said about being very efficient with
[00:10:19] your movements I think a lot about like
[00:10:22] I'll do some of my memory stuff in my
[00:10:25] head and that's mostly to just forget
[00:10:27] where I am so that I end up where I want
[00:10:30] to be right before I even know it like
[00:10:33] ah yeah that was I was just down there
[00:10:35] now I'm here I was reviewing all the
[00:10:37] countries and the Capitals or whatever
[00:10:41] so tell me so you you were you've tried
[00:10:44] to versus four times is that right right
[00:10:46] four times 1/7 yeah and you that was
[00:10:49] 2011 you made it to the top that was a
[00:10:52] year I was there we met
[00:10:54] and what David you started was it Friday
[00:10:56] the 13th
[00:10:57] or you get one later I would make money
[00:10:59] first
[00:11:00] yeah yeah okay I remember that year we
[00:11:02] went out Friday the 13th and uh didn't
[00:11:06] make it I think we had okay weather but
[00:11:08] you guys waited a little longer
[00:11:09] I remember how many Doug I think I was
[00:11:12] jumping up died on a camp three and we
[00:11:14] were at the upper camp three and you're
[00:11:16] at the lower camp three that's right
[00:11:18] yeah and I remember you call you I was
[00:11:20] going by I was just in this trance and I
[00:11:23] remember you know I hear ya know Alan
[00:11:25] and I looked over and I I don't yeah I
[00:11:27] remember I didn't recognize you but
[00:11:30] later I put it all together and you're
[00:11:32] kind of maybe a thumbs up and I'm just
[00:11:34] gonna kind of gave off yeah whatever
[00:11:36] yeah just stumbling by that's right I
[00:11:40] remember that that was uh that was a
[00:11:42] hard day so and then so okay so you you
[00:11:47] got tried in what years before 2010
[00:11:51] three and eight okay Wow over a ten-year
[00:11:56] span basically yeah okay I thought about
[00:11:59] what that is right you know what's
[00:12:01] interesting is that I'm convinced not
[00:12:04] only I know for a fact that I was in
[00:12:08] much better physical shape at age 54
[00:12:11] tonight was at 45 or 40 for the first
[00:12:15] time I tried it when I was uh I was I
[00:12:18] was much better prepared but mentally
[00:12:20] and emotionally and I I look back at my
[00:12:24] early attempts and and it's a it's a
[00:12:28] case study and what not to do that's
[00:12:31] true but now I guess you learned from it
[00:12:33] right would you say that the fourth time
[00:12:35] you did it you did things that obviously
[00:12:38] didn't want to do repeat again from the
[00:12:41] first time like did you or was it pretty
[00:12:43] much the same no no it was drastically
[00:12:46] different my my entire approach was 90
[00:12:49] days present all the way from all from
[00:12:52] training to who I went with to my gear
[00:12:56] to but all of those things which you
[00:12:59] would expect but the big difference was
[00:13:02] that my attitude completely changed it
[00:13:04] when I was first independent 2002
[00:13:07] I was flying Nico bragging rights I
[00:13:09] would climb me - you know - to be a
[00:13:11] summit you know summit bagger and Pete
[00:13:14] bag and in 2011 I was climbing for a
[00:13:18] purpose in my life of you know to honor
[00:13:20] my mother in around Alzheimer's but also
[00:13:22] I gave myself permission and this is
[00:13:26] this is probably the key element I gave
[00:13:28] myself permission to enjoy the
[00:13:30] experience the good things and the bad
[00:13:33] things because you know that when you go
[00:13:35] on these expeditions you just a group of
[00:13:38] just four strangers you all meet in
[00:13:39] Kathmandu and you know you look around
[00:13:42] the table and you're trying to figure
[00:13:44] out who can I trust my life - if I
[00:13:46] needed to or who do I want to spend time
[00:13:48] with an intent at the South Col you know
[00:13:52] who's going to be my buddy whom I really
[00:13:54] wanted to avoid and I surround I make
[00:13:56] conscious decisions to surround myself
[00:13:58] with positive people with like-minded
[00:14:00] people that people that has shared
[00:14:03] values with what I do
[00:14:05] we all had to shared purpose whether
[00:14:07] it's a summit but everybody has has a
[00:14:09] different reason for climbing Everest
[00:14:11] and the other thing I did was I made
[00:14:12] conscious choices around like what I did
[00:14:15] at the wall and for example getting sick
[00:14:18] in 2011 you know everybody just sit in
[00:14:22] the hall I don't care what the guy is
[00:14:24] telling you everybody just says cracking
[00:14:26] you know the indica and Boo everybody
[00:14:28] this city base camp I don't care how
[00:14:30] good of a doctor or how good of a food
[00:14:32] is everybody does yeah so in my first
[00:14:37] attempts when I got sick I mean it
[00:14:39] played a mental game oh sure this time
[00:14:41] in 2011 I got really really sick I mean
[00:14:44] I took but you know the z-pak and
[00:14:45] nothing happening I finally you know did
[00:14:48] the nuclear option with a antibody
[00:14:50] called levaquin and and it I hate myself
[00:14:54] permission for lady might tune up for
[00:14:56] three days and do nothing but get well
[00:14:58] and I didn't I didn't read about it I
[00:15:01] didn't I didn't get all worried oh my
[00:15:03] gosh here goes my summit he was like no
[00:15:05] you're sick you need to heal stressed
[00:15:08] you need to give yourself permission to
[00:15:10] lay here to drink to eat to rest and let
[00:15:14] your body recover and I wouldn't through
[00:15:17] that process and I came out the other
[00:15:18] side of it and the
[00:15:20] I say I went up with my son that Bush
[00:15:22] that's great you know so if there's an
[00:15:25] awful lot that goes on in your mind
[00:15:27] yeah yeah yeah as I can tell you the
[00:15:29] mind can be conquered and trained for
[00:15:31] sure
[00:15:32] yeah well yeah you're there look at I
[00:15:35] gotta ask y'all I don't know if I'm
[00:15:37] asked you before but uh what's the
[00:15:39] summit like what's the sown in their
[00:15:41] wrist like you know it's a pointy kind
[00:15:49] of a rolling hill you know rolling top a
[00:15:52] lot of prayer flags were up there kind
[00:15:54] of to my disappointment
[00:15:57] they had carved out a bench that's very
[00:16:00] nice sit down I know so it wasn't quite
[00:16:03] the you know the rugged spot that I
[00:16:06] expected there was no rocks but prayer
[00:16:09] flags all over the place does he have
[00:16:10] pictures of Dalai Lama and other
[00:16:12] people's you know families and children
[00:16:14] and wives and husbands but the big thing
[00:16:17] is that it is a place where for me I
[00:16:22] just felt unbelievably tiny and I it was
[00:16:27] a sense of perspective you think that
[00:16:29] you know I I really disliked the term of
[00:16:32] conquering the mountain the mountain
[00:16:35] allows you to maybe summit maybe not and
[00:16:39] when I understanding on the summit I was
[00:16:41] all I was unbelievably grateful I was
[00:16:44] humbled that I was you know honored to
[00:16:46] be able to do it for my cause but also
[00:16:48] at that moment I felt unbelievably small
[00:16:51] I felt very insignificant looking out we
[00:16:54] had a pretty day I'd lived long is like
[00:16:56] 20 degrees below zero 20 mile an hour
[00:16:58] wind so it was cold and windy gusty but
[00:17:01] it was clear and as I looked out you
[00:17:04] know I can see the summit shadow passing
[00:17:07] off into the west you know I looked into
[00:17:10] too bad to Boutin into Nepal you can see
[00:17:13] Makalu I mean I'm gonna blog which just
[00:17:16] just occupies attract young it just it
[00:17:20] just melts into the landscape you can't
[00:17:22] even pick it out you know it's just
[00:17:24] another 20,000 foot in mountain and when
[00:17:27] you're at 29,000 but you know this is
[00:17:30] really tiny I fell really tiny
[00:17:32] very relatable very humble yeah I
[00:17:34] remember when I first tried the nollie
[00:17:37] we flew in we landed on the glacier
[00:17:40] there and we saw the peak you know and I
[00:17:42] hadn't taken a moment we were taking us
[00:17:44] up off the little plane and just
[00:17:46] organizing our expedition I look up and
[00:17:48] there it is and that was the Nala which
[00:17:50] is 20,000 feet and I remember for the
[00:17:52] first time in the mountains feeling that
[00:17:54] feeling of being this big and
[00:17:56] unimportant and then I was just a part
[00:18:00] of this world nothing more like just a
[00:18:03] grain of salt kind of thing and I think
[00:18:06] that's really what I like about the
[00:18:08] mountains is that it reminds you it just
[00:18:11] resets you back to you know the basics
[00:18:14] the elements and and you realize what
[00:18:16] you actually are which is nothing even
[00:18:19] though you are it's complicated because
[00:18:20] we're all about we're talking about
[00:18:21] memories and making it all about us but
[00:18:24] then at the same time it's kind of like
[00:18:26] it's not important nothing is important
[00:18:28] because it's it's we're all the same
[00:18:31] it's you know it's it's interesting well
[00:18:34] I think it again I think is that sense
[00:18:36] of perspective and being grateful and
[00:18:39] and that the opportunity to climb a
[00:18:42] mountain like Everest or a k2 is it's
[00:18:45] very few and it's a rich rich
[00:18:47] opportunity is it's nothing to be taken
[00:18:49] for granted or to be boasted about if
[00:18:53] you're able to be successful then it's a
[00:18:57] moment it's a life moment as a teaching
[00:18:59] moment it's a learning opportunity yeah
[00:19:01] and compared to k2 summit how did that
[00:19:05] feel I mean in terms of what they look
[00:19:06] like
[00:19:07] physically but also how they felt yeah
[00:19:12] yeah hey Kate the summit of Everest like
[00:19:15] I said it's kind of kind of pointy and
[00:19:17] rounded k2 summit is is relatively
[00:19:21] larger it's more of a more of a flat
[00:19:23] round top it's not quite pointy as
[00:19:26] Everest is but the approach coming up to
[00:19:29] it my gosh is that when you leave
[00:19:31] advanced base camp at around 18,000 feet
[00:19:34] it goes up at a 45 degree angle and I'm
[00:19:38] stopped and I mean you know you go into
[00:19:40] the Western c'mon Everest and the South
[00:19:42] Col so you have these these parts where
[00:19:45] kind of narrow
[00:19:46] in a glass sound that k2 has nothing
[00:19:49] like that until you get to the very top
[00:19:50] up to the ground camp for 25,000 feet
[00:19:53] and there it deflate ingest a little bit
[00:19:55] but then it just picks right back up um
[00:19:57] it is steepest unrelenting unforgiving
[00:20:00] it's rock its physical it's the most
[00:20:04] physical climb I've ever had in my life
[00:20:05] and again I was developing pulmonary
[00:20:08] edema which I didn't realize it at the
[00:20:09] time but oddly enough talk about the
[00:20:12] mind I I never considered turning around
[00:20:16] I had a very very very deep moment where
[00:20:21] I just felt like that that I was dying
[00:20:25] on the mountain and that's another
[00:20:26] entire story but I never ever considered
[00:20:29] turning around and I hope my choices
[00:20:32] were to sit down the snow and die or to
[00:20:35] continue to go to the top and I was able
[00:20:39] to draw upon energy of people you know
[00:20:43] past present and future that that loved
[00:20:45] me cared about me and and I firmly
[00:20:48] believe I was able to channel that
[00:20:50] energy to to take myself to a place that
[00:20:52] that I didn't know existed and so
[00:20:56] reaching the summit of k2
[00:20:58] oddly enough and this is paradoxical
[00:21:01] that I felt almost nothing I reached the
[00:21:05] top and I realized where I was you know
[00:21:09] I took out my phone and I called my good
[00:21:10] buddy Jim Davison and and and he
[00:21:14] screamed at me to double-check
[00:21:15] everything that will check everything
[00:21:18] which was great advices intuitively we
[00:21:22] climbed enough together to he recognized
[00:21:24] that I was not at the top of my game and
[00:21:26] something was wrong but you know and
[00:21:29] then I I did look around and did the
[00:21:32] 360-degree view and looked into China
[00:21:34] and solid you know glaciers that you
[00:21:36] just don't see from anyplace else and
[00:21:38] back in the Goodwin Austin glacier and
[00:21:42] and and you realize where you are and
[00:21:45] yeah and I did have a moment where he's
[00:21:47] completely lost it broke down Wow
[00:21:51] well I can't wait to read the book you
[00:21:53] hope you're reading a book yeah that
[00:21:55] sounds riveting and super inspiring I
[00:21:57] I mean I don't think I'll ever climb k2
[00:21:59] but I would love to at least do the base
[00:22:02] camp trek and visit that part of the
[00:22:04] Himalayas it looks beautiful
[00:22:06] yes an awesome scenery tracking entry
[00:22:09] Montero yeah
[00:22:10] had you been there before not everything
[00:22:12] I have I tried in 2006 like I put
[00:22:15] together an expedition trying to do
[00:22:16] broad peak and k2 and it was a total
[00:22:20] disaster that I organized it working
[00:22:23] with another company but I did all the
[00:22:25] front working and lo and behold I
[00:22:28] learned that people lie that people
[00:22:30] represent their their client egress it
[00:22:32] amazing to get on the next edition like
[00:22:34] this I don't know what about like that's
[00:22:37] amazing
[00:22:38] and now so what's what's next for you so
[00:22:41] you had your big you have a big plan
[00:22:43] tell us how that's going what it is
[00:22:45] yeah it's called Project 8000 I you know
[00:22:49] there's 14 mountains about 8,000 meter
[00:22:51] on the planet and I've been the six I
[00:22:53] summited three and I would like to over
[00:22:56] the next five years knock off my
[00:22:58] remaining eleven and my senior goal is
[00:23:01] to reach 100 million people and erase
[00:23:03] five million dollars for Alzheimer's
[00:23:04] research so I mean I'm in the hunt for
[00:23:08] sponsors because that's kind of how my
[00:23:10] life is these days and so I'm looking
[00:23:13] you know ideally I'd love to fight one
[00:23:15] company that would sponsor me for five
[00:23:16] years and prove that getting old doesn't
[00:23:19] need something a next year watching NFL
[00:23:21] football but you know you can stay
[00:23:22] active and get out there make a
[00:23:24] difference in the world
[00:23:25] so and if I can pull it together and I
[00:23:28] may be back in the fall the spring fight
[00:23:30] ensued then I'll probably try to accept
[00:23:32] Losey if not then maybe I'll try to -
[00:23:35] the problems and the summer it not that
[00:23:37] maybe dogwood garion evolve
[00:23:39] so with us bill maybe perhaps right
[00:23:42] that's great yeah he was so we were in
[00:23:45] Peru together we were he was saying that
[00:23:48] Everest might be his last
[00:23:50] this spring might be his last Everest
[00:23:52] and yeah he's kind of sick of the crowd
[00:23:55] so I guess that's why he's well you know
[00:23:57] the whole everything is changing
[00:23:59] dramatically with respect to the guy he
[00:24:00] was very qualified
[00:24:02] Nepali operators and Sherpas are coming
[00:24:06] into the
[00:24:06] into into the market and they're
[00:24:09] offering anywhere from fifty to you know
[00:24:11] honey percent less than what the Western
[00:24:14] guys do and but you know with that price
[00:24:17] is commensurate the service
[00:24:18] there's no Western guides with it it's
[00:24:21] they're qualified Sherpa guys and
[00:24:24] they're really taking up the market so
[00:24:26] what we're seeing is a bifurcation in
[00:24:28] the marketplace with the the traditional
[00:24:30] Western companies are raising their
[00:24:32] prices for example Himalayan experience
[00:24:35] with ninety seventy thousand dollars
[00:24:36] this year instead of 65 55 in the
[00:24:39] previous two years and other ones like
[00:24:42] seven Suns track and destination
[00:24:44] dreamers are coming in at thirty
[00:24:46] thousand so we see this this split and
[00:24:49] also we're seeing new people coming to
[00:24:50] the our seat primarily from the middle
[00:24:53] class in India and also in China so you
[00:24:56] know taking mountain yeah and are you
[00:24:59] gonna are you gonna be blogging about I
[00:25:02] mean if unless you're there if you're
[00:25:04] not are you gonna be covering it like
[00:25:06] you usually do yeah that's my plane good
[00:25:10] and what else the in terms of I mean you
[00:25:13] just told me a little bit about what
[00:25:15] it's looking like now but what are you
[00:25:17] hearing about this coming season I'm
[00:25:19] hearing that that most of the major
[00:25:22] operators are at half of their previous
[00:25:24] loads let's act yeah less so it looked
[00:25:28] to be I would guess normally there's
[00:25:30] around around 350 every permits issued
[00:25:35] to Westerners and I I'm guessing that
[00:25:38] we're going to see the neighborhood of
[00:25:40] 200 of 225 for the spring and last year
[00:25:45] Losey had a hundred and twenty permits
[00:25:49] which was the highest ever and I think
[00:25:51] we'll see you know go back to the normal
[00:25:52] 30 or 40 so I think the mountains going
[00:25:55] to be relative to previous years maybe
[00:25:58] sixty percent of the volume yeah and you
[00:26:00] think that's because of the just the
[00:26:02] fact that there were avalanches the past
[00:26:04] two years earthquake or is it more
[00:26:07] government stuff in the permits
[00:26:10] I think it's a little bit of all of that
[00:26:12] I think people are that the fact that
[00:26:15] Nepal the new constitution has been
[00:26:17] implemented in a
[00:26:18] a in a really difficult way that
[00:26:21] resulted in all these embargoes and
[00:26:23] branch up fuel shortages that's
[00:26:26] discouraging people from going I think
[00:26:29] there's a train of thought amongst a lot
[00:26:30] of people that says the mountain and
[00:26:32] needs to settle after the massive
[00:26:34] earthquake and the aftershocks would
[00:26:36] have continued so you know let's give it
[00:26:38] another let another year and see how it
[00:26:40] goes this year you know the fact of the
[00:26:43] Polly's in in theory they've announced
[00:26:45] they extended the 2015 permits the 1617
[00:26:49] even though that's not being confirmed
[00:26:51] that people are saying well this wait
[00:26:53] until 17 and then use my my permit for
[00:26:57] those people that wanted to go back and
[00:26:59] then I think there's a general feeling
[00:27:00] that you know that if you want look at
[00:27:03] it from a from a spiritual perspective
[00:27:05] that you know the mountain gods are
[00:27:08] telling people that you know we need to
[00:27:10] let the mountain rest yeah and so
[00:27:12] there's a fair number of people around
[00:27:14] the globe that will say you know what
[00:27:15] that's fine the mountain will be there
[00:27:17] in 2017 or 18 or 19 all this wait till
[00:27:21] then so it's complicated
[00:27:22] there were places for a reason yeah yeah
[00:27:24] I think even peak freaks who I went with
[00:27:27] in 2011 I don't think they had a single
[00:27:29] person sign up so they're not gonna be
[00:27:31] there this year that's what I heard I
[00:27:33] don't know if that's similar yeah you
[00:27:36] know I know Russell Rice did you just
[00:27:39] say publicly that he was in half but
[00:27:42] then I you know the other ones were
[00:27:45] saying that there's a lot of marketing
[00:27:46] involved yeah yeah so it's very
[00:27:49] difficult to know because you know we're
[00:27:51] gonna have a guy you know Phil Phil is
[00:27:53] very unique in his transparency and his
[00:27:56] honesty about you know how he runs his
[00:27:59] business you know all the way from you
[00:28:01] know you pay a price for him and that
[00:28:03] includes everything from tips
[00:28:05] transportation and other companies you
[00:28:07] know it's a bait-and-switch strategy you
[00:28:09] come in low and then they make it one
[00:28:10] died and you for everything else so
[00:28:12] there's a lot of marketing and its
[00:28:14] really a buyer beware marketing and high
[00:28:16] altitude claim yeah what's your what's
[00:28:19] your what's your best memory actually a
[00:28:24] better way to ask this I guess is what
[00:28:26] what would you say you know do me v1 but
[00:28:30] one
[00:28:31] your most happiest moments you know I
[00:28:34] remember I remember sitting in the tent
[00:28:38] at the South Pole and I was with a 37
[00:28:43] year old German lady Miriam and then she
[00:28:47] and I were sharing a tent at the South
[00:28:49] Pole and a guy we got we got up from
[00:28:51] camp three minute there really fast like
[00:28:53] three hours so you're right around nine
[00:28:55] o'clock in the morning and the weather
[00:28:57] was supposed to be great that day and of
[00:28:58] course it was horrible and kind of wind
[00:29:01] is just blowing you know the Tim is
[00:29:04] going billowing in and out we're just
[00:29:07] you know we're not sleeping bags and
[00:29:08] just laying there and you know had a
[00:29:11] little bit of oxygen going like half a
[00:29:13] liter a minute just to kind of take the
[00:29:14] edge off and you know a Connie would
[00:29:17] come over every now and then unzip and
[00:29:19] stick its head and go you know okay okay
[00:29:21] okay
[00:29:22] any idea bring in you know some melted
[00:29:25] snow some hot tepid water but I remember
[00:29:28] being there at the South Pole just
[00:29:30] wondering if you know this for time if I
[00:29:34] was going to be able to make it or not
[00:29:35] if I was going to be given the
[00:29:37] opportunity and letting my mind and
[00:29:40] again giving myself permission to to
[00:29:43] enjoy the moment and let my mind go
[00:29:45] wherever it wanted to go and sharing
[00:29:48] deep feelings with Miriam her OMA died
[00:29:51] from Alzheimer's and you know we shared
[00:29:54] memories of our mother and her
[00:29:57] grandmother and and we talked about
[00:29:59] dreams and you know and what this would
[00:30:02] mean to us and if we got the opportunity
[00:30:04] and it was just a moment of just just
[00:30:10] the purity you know it was just it was
[00:30:13] it was clean it was clear it was um
[00:30:17] there was no pretense it was just it was
[00:30:21] really an honest human experience and
[00:30:24] then went on for all day long but this
[00:30:26] is this like somebody walked over to a
[00:30:28] to a wall and and flicked the light
[00:30:29] switch around eight o'clock at night the
[00:30:31] winds just stopped it cleared and we
[00:30:35] just had an awesome opportunity to go to
[00:30:37] the time did she sign it - he did nice
[00:30:40] yeah she was taking my but I mean she
[00:30:42] was she was ahead of me by you know
[00:30:44] 10 or 15 minutes and I didn't so the
[00:30:48] shirt that she was with it was it was
[00:30:50] her in him and in a comedy and I know
[00:30:53] and I I was just pushing as hard as I

[00:00:04] you
[00:00:26] why so I got this little poem the day
[00:00:47] before i went to New York and it was
[00:00:50] like a poet Biscayne poet sits there any
[00:00:54] rights pawns with his little typewriter
[00:00:55] based on what three words you give them
[00:00:58] and I think I said I was moving to New
[00:01:00] York had heartache and was just excited
[00:01:03] to move so he wrote this thing and I've
[00:01:07] kept it in my wallet got his spelling
[00:01:09] and grammar is really bad afraid with 2
[00:01:11] f's there's a lot wrong with this he
[00:01:13] said so I'm gonna take the l train to
[00:01:15] Coney Island can't take the l train to

[00:01:51] the 20s and 30s below zero from parts of
[00:01:54] the Midwest into the Northeast portions
[00:01:56] of upstate New York where we're going
[00:01:58] tomorrow may see wind chills as low as
[00:02:01] 50 below zero the hilarious thing is
[00:02:04] that I climb mountains I have all the
[00:02:06] gear to whether something this cold but

[00:01:04] trying to do one every single day is
[00:01:06] pretty daunting I don't know how some of
[00:01:07] these vloggers do it so it might have to
[00:01:09] be more like every few days for
[00:01:13] now check this out I made this I knit
[00:01:16] this with my own hands today I wanted to

[00:01:24] [Music]
[00:01:25] Everest you check TV as a lot of you
[00:01:29] know I I have this climb coming up going
[00:01:31] to climb Everest from the South Side in
[00:01:34] about 1 and 1/2 months and I'll be on
[00:01:36] the mount for 2 months climbing the
[00:01:38] thing it'll be my third try today's Vlog
[00:01:41] is going to be about how I almost died
[00:01:44] on Everest in
[00:01:47] 2011 in 2011 I attempted Mount Everest I
[00:01:52] went on an expedition for 2 months I
[00:01:55] went with a company called Peak freaks
[00:01:57] Canadian company run by an awesome guy
[00:02:01] named Tim Ripple with an awesome Sherpa
[00:02:03] team and you know I had never climbed
[00:02:07] anything of that caliber before I'd done
[00:02:09] a lot of climbing over the years before
[00:02:11] leading up to it I started with Mount
[00:02:13] reineer then went on to do Mount
[00:02:15] McKinley Denali M Blanc in the Alps and
[00:02:18] then I just jumped into Everest it was a
[00:02:21] scary kind of crazy experience I mean
[00:02:23] this was 5 years ago I was 27 years old
[00:02:27] it was actually the first year I won the
[00:02:29] memory championship ship too that 2011
[00:02:31] was a great year you know I just won
[00:02:33] that March 2011 for the first time it
[00:02:35] was amazing six of Space six of Spades
[00:02:39] two of Hearts okay Jack of
[00:02:43] Spades four of Hearts oh I would just
[00:02:46] like to be the first one to congratulate
[00:02:48] the new USA champion
[00:02:50] [Music]
[00:02:51] [Applause]
[00:02:57] Nelson on the Today's Show can do with
[00:03:00] your brain that kind of stimulates like
[00:03:01] and then immediately after I flew
[00:03:03] thousands of miles away to Catman de
[00:03:06] bequeathed my opportunity to be on the I
[00:03:10] think it was brain games at the time on
[00:03:11] that Geo Channel to Ron White whatever
[00:03:15] so I was there I was there for 2 months
[00:03:17] you know for most people who are
[00:03:19] climbing Everest right you take two
[00:03:22] months a lot of people are shocked by
[00:03:24] this but you basically climb
[00:03:29] it's tough to
[00:03:31] say I'd say out of the whole two months
[00:03:33] that you're there you're probably
[00:03:35] actually climbing for
[00:03:37] Just Two Weeks two actual weeks of
[00:03:40] climbing maybe even less uh a lot of is
[00:03:42] just sitting around waiting let's do a
[00:03:44] little diagram to understand the
[00:03:46] [Music]
[00:03:50] mountain you never seen
[00:03:53] before in the
[00:03:56] glaz like a face with the basil we like
[00:04:00] there and I hate you so I'm a
[00:04:01]  Nick night with running
[00:04:04] you know all right now we a calm over
[00:04:06] long cuz my f
[00:04:07] [Music]
[00:04:13] A's so I'm sleeping here you know
[00:04:16] passing some z's this is on May 12th and
[00:04:19] what happens is at 700 p.m. at night we
[00:04:22] get to goahead to climb this thing it's
[00:04:25] about to get dark it's cold and we head
[00:04:28] out so the idea is that it takes takes
[00:04:30] about if you're healthy 8 hours to get
[00:04:33] to the Top If you're in good shape you
[00:04:36] come down and maybe a fraction of that
[00:04:39] say 3 4
[00:04:42] hours so a summit day is going to be 11
[00:04:46] 12 hours or more if you're not in that
[00:04:49] great shape which happens often so think
[00:04:51] about that your summit day is 14 hours
[00:04:54] of climbing along the way here all right
[00:04:57] there are a few kind of landmarks that
[00:04:59] takes about 4 hours to get to once you
[00:05:02] get there you change your oxygen you
[00:05:04] have some water and you rest then you
[00:05:07] get to here South Summit it's kind of
[00:05:09] like a fall Summit you get to it and you
[00:05:11] think you're at the top but actually
[00:05:12] there's a little more to go and that
[00:05:14] takes about another 4 hours a little
[00:05:16] faster if if you're in this 8 hour
[00:05:19] period and then here you have the
[00:05:21] Hillary Step final Summit Ridge can take
[00:05:23] about 1 hour if you're good so at 700
[00:05:26] p.m.
[00:05:29] I'm here I'm feeling strong I'm feeling
[00:05:31] great I'm ready to do this we head out
[00:05:35] to the balcony takes me about 4 hours
[00:05:37] feeling great the night is really calm
[00:05:40] and I can see the stars the moon is out
[00:05:42] I have my toasty hand warmers everything
[00:05:45] is good I feel
[00:05:47] like this is it this is this is how
[00:05:50] difficult it is we get to the balcony
[00:05:52] and I sit down unzip my jacket take out
[00:05:54] my 1 L bottle of water my Sherpa is
[00:05:57] changing my oxygen while I take my mask
[00:05:59] off and drink we rest for maybe 5 10
[00:06:01] minutes and we head out again so we
[00:06:02] start heading out here I'm still feeling
[00:06:04] good but then suddenly I realize as I
[00:06:08] put my mask
[00:06:10] back I can't breathe if you think about
[00:06:13] we have these masks on that give us
[00:06:15] supplemental oxygen with the mask on it
[00:06:17] adds more oxygen to the air so it feels
[00:06:19] like you're a little lower not like sea
[00:06:21] level but maybe 3,000 ft lower I realize
[00:06:25] that I can't breathe through it it's
[00:06:26] frozen there's a lot of saliva that
[00:06:28] builds up inside the whole thing froze
[00:06:30] whenever I would Breathe In it would
[00:06:31] just stick to my face so I panicked I
[00:06:33] didn't know what to do basically I
[00:06:35] figure out a makeshift way to breathe
[00:06:38] I'm kind of like breathing out of the
[00:06:39] Mask eventually the stuff melts and I'm
[00:06:41] able to wear it normally but I maybe
[00:06:43] climb for an hour with that situation
[00:06:45] going on we go up to the South Summit
[00:06:47] which was very very hard that took
[00:06:49] another 4 hours so I'm 8 hours in and I
[00:06:52] sit down and I almost collaps so I had
[00:06:56] one more hour supposedly to this Summit
[00:07:00] there's the Hillary Step and the Summit
[00:07:02] Ridge to the summit you know it had
[00:07:03] taken me maybe 8 hours to go up had
[00:07:06] another hour then you got to take
[00:07:08] another 4 hours back down to the South
[00:07:09] call where you don't really want to
[00:07:11] sleep another night and so you're
[00:07:12] looking at
[00:07:14] another 8 hours at least to get back
[00:07:17] down to safety before the whole thing is
[00:07:19] done you know big part of me very
[00:07:22] competitive don't give up very easily
[00:07:25] said no let's go let's go to the base of
[00:07:27] the Hillary Step and see what's going on
[00:07:29] so I walked I walked from where I was
[00:07:31] sitting to the Hillary Step and you're
[00:07:34] walking over this knife edge Ridge you
[00:07:38] know it's maybe a boot wide down one way
[00:07:41] it's a 3,000 ft drop into Nepal and down
[00:07:45] the other way it's a 2,000 ft drop it's
[00:07:47] for the most part pitch black I have a
[00:07:50] headlamp here that can maybe see a
[00:07:52] distance of 10 m ahead of me so I'm
[00:07:55] looking over and I see just a little bit
[00:07:57] of a drop and then in inity of Blackness
[00:08:00] right both sides I remember walking
[00:08:02] there and then looking up and seeing how
[00:08:05] difficult it looked given my situation
[00:08:07] my feeling and I said no I can't do this
[00:08:10] so I went back trying to pass around
[00:08:12] people so I have to step away from the
[00:08:13] Rope uncp myself you know if I slip I'm
[00:08:17] gone I'm dead you can't really ask for
[00:08:19] help cuz everybody's there on their own
[00:08:21] mission they're exerting their own
[00:08:22] energy to survive for themselves so we
[00:08:25] go back to the South Summit I sit there
[00:08:26] for a little while and I'm just
[00:08:30] so conflicted do I continue do I give up
[00:08:34] what's the right thing to do am I being
[00:08:36] a am I being weak am I being safe
[00:08:40] what's the right answer I couldn't
[00:08:42] figure it out and just at that point it
[00:08:44] was like 3:00 a.m. pitch black of the
[00:08:46] night you know I think an hour more or
[00:08:50] so I would have started to see the gray
[00:08:51] of light and then at 5:00 a.m. I
[00:08:53] definitely would have seen the sunlight
[00:08:55] Rising I think that would have made the
[00:08:57] difference so by that point while I was
[00:08:59] making the decision my hand warmer
[00:09:01] stopped working and I was actually my
[00:09:03] hands were freezing when I was actually
[00:09:04] really worried that I was going to get
[00:09:06] frostbite I was it I went back down made
[00:09:09] me realize thank God I didn't go up
[00:09:10] because the way I'm feeling now just add
[00:09:13] another hour or two of wasted energy how
[00:09:17] would I be reacting or moving now but at
[00:09:22] the same time sunlight would have been
[00:09:23] up I would have summited who knows I
[00:09:25] might have been just I would have had
[00:09:27] the a ReDiscover
[00:09:29] kind of energy and and excitement that
[00:09:32] maybe it would have been easy to do to
[00:09:35] come back down it would have been easier
[00:09:36] I would have been in a better position
[00:09:37] who knows a big part of me was like what
[00:09:40] the what the hell am I doing here what's
[00:09:42] what's the point you know is it the
[00:09:44] glory sum it ever big deal is it a
[00:09:48] personal thing what's it worth and in
[00:09:51] that moment I I felt that nothing is
[00:09:54] really worth it I'd rather be back home
[00:09:58] with my family eating chicken
[00:10:01] nuggets it it it with you cuz now
[00:10:03] I think about it I'm like you know
[00:10:05] getting to the top living that
[00:10:08] experience might be one of the best
[00:10:11] things yet when I was there I thought
[00:10:13] the opposite it's a crazy
[00:10:16] thing
[00:10:18] but that's the way it goes thank you for
[00:10:21] listening to that story
[00:10:30] [Music]
[00:10:37] off

[00:02:53] like I'm in this mix oh let's see how I
[00:02:56] do I used to be good at numbers now used
[00:03:00] to be good numbers translates to kind of
[00:03:06] out of the game and not as good as
[00:03:07] everybody else at numbers I love crazy
[00:03:13] socks today we're going to the Rainbow

=== Nelson Dellis' MIND SHOW - Yusnier Viera // Human Calendar ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx2Mk8v2cLM

[00:00:30] welcome everybody this is Nelson Dellis
[00:00:32] four-time USA memory champion and we
[00:00:35] have a special guest today use near
[00:00:36] Vieira the what's your name now is the
[00:00:40] human calculator that's that's Scott
[00:00:42] kept your the human calendar right
[00:00:44] exactly yeah my name is the again on the
[00:00:46] human condom because I have penis with
[00:00:47] rugged loom anthem at I'm thinking also
[00:00:49] for these great interview and yeah don't
[00:00:52] worry we are yeah um so we haven't
[00:00:55] caught up in a while using your I are
[00:00:56] both from Miami and you know I moved to
[00:01:00] New York for a little bit so I've kind
[00:01:01] of missed out on his recent success I
[00:01:03] mean you've done some crazy things in
[00:01:05] the past year like what did you tell
[00:01:07] everybody what you were just doing well
[00:01:10] I have me I have meets all of our
[00:01:13] meetings too so it's like my case this
[00:01:15] year has been wonderful for me because I
[00:01:18] i was able to be part of the superhuman
[00:01:20] show yeah which is the US version of the
[00:01:24] of the brain which is that show that was
[00:01:26] originally creating Germany yeah and a
[00:01:28] libido unfortunate China France South
[00:01:32] America Brazil I was all the brazilian
[00:01:34] version too and I'm really from Cuba in
[00:01:38] Brazil we did the Latin American version
[00:01:40] of the of the brain called super brains
[00:01:42] or super survivors in Spanish yeah and
[00:01:44] yeah for me being this show is was a
[00:01:47] great experience because they want me to
[00:01:49] do they wanted me to do something
[00:01:50] different is something that is called
[00:01:52] flash math also some people call it
[00:01:54] flash handsome yeah which is pretty much
[00:01:56] numbers that are flashing on a board
[00:01:58] huge numbers flushing the board and I
[00:02:00] need to add them up like 10 to the
[00:02:02] numbers i need to add them up and i'm
[00:02:04] talking about in a matter of seconds so
[00:02:06] it will literally flash the numbers yeah
[00:02:08] there were flashes numbers they were
[00:02:10] like three rounds actually three rounds
[00:02:12] in the first round the numbers were
[00:02:14] rushing for 300 milliseconds okay so
[00:02:17] three tenths of a second in the second
[00:02:19] round was just to tenth of a second from
[00:02:21] 200 milliseconds and the last round the
[00:02:23] lightning round was 100 milliseconds it
[00:02:26] was crazy it was crazy for me that was
[00:02:28] kind of impossible to be eating because
[00:02:30] I didn't have the preparation for that
[00:02:31] then later I start practicing a lot and
[00:02:34] I was able to be successful in the show
[00:02:36] I'm very I'm very very grateful for that
[00:02:39] because that gave me the opportunity
[00:02:40] last a
[00:02:42] it lasts in gasoline I wasn't the ellen
[00:02:45] show which was a great experience as
[00:02:47] well and it seems that she loved my
[00:02:49] segment and Wow not for me I missed a
[00:02:52] lot yeah so she is such a great
[00:02:54] personality like any yeah that's the I
[00:02:57] think once you get on that show that's
[00:02:59] there's nothing really else you can be
[00:03:00] baby tonight show but just as good
[00:03:03] because you will probably more people
[00:03:04] watch that he's number one in the you
[00:03:07] know national TV number one at that time
[00:03:09] yeah this is my am so so let's talk
[00:03:13] first about the superhuman show because
[00:03:15] that was huge inning millions of people
[00:03:17] saw it you didn't end up winning it was
[00:03:19] but it was decided by votes of the
[00:03:21] audience luis angel who we had on here
[00:03:24] earlier this week one memorizing names
[00:03:27] and features and where the people were
[00:03:29] from but you have to do the flash like
[00:03:31] you said the constellations first of all
[00:03:35] how was the experience of being on the
[00:03:36] show I mean were you nervous you said it
[00:03:39] wasn't usually do calendar stuff but
[00:03:41] you're good at math mentally so how did
[00:03:44] you prepare for it and what was the
[00:03:45] experience like for me was a challenge
[00:03:48] because like you say I'm my spirit I
[00:03:50] would say they make theory that one that
[00:03:51] I practice the most is kinda digs which
[00:03:54] is given a date told you the day of the
[00:03:56] week as soon as possible I have to the
[00:03:58] records doing that I mean any other
[00:04:00] thing that I do is just like I just need
[00:04:02] to practice because I'm not an expert in
[00:04:03] those fields so in this case they want
[00:04:06] me to the flash math which I found flash
[00:04:09] math anymore I'll say amazing then
[00:04:12] kinder I used to think that kinda is one
[00:04:14] of the most amazing skills you could
[00:04:17] have because you can choke someone like
[00:04:18] really like in a matter of seconds of
[00:04:20] this flash man got me the first time I
[00:04:23] saw I said Wow how can you do that it's
[00:04:25] so cool doing that so I stopped
[00:04:27] practicing every day or you know for a
[00:04:30] few hours and until I got it anyway I
[00:04:33] mean it's a charge it's very challenging
[00:04:35] because sometimes you you think it you
[00:04:37] got it and maybe because somebody's it
[00:04:40] have to be like yeah you have to have
[00:04:42] absolute silent yeah because any
[00:04:44] anything could messed up the whole
[00:04:46] challenge so in my case being the
[00:04:49] superhuman doing that was was probably
[00:04:51] the most difficult challenge with my
[00:04:52] whole life okay did they give you
[00:04:55] on the show you did it three times right
[00:04:57] yes and what they showed on the the
[00:05:00] final show was that how it went or did
[00:05:02] they give you more attempts or do they
[00:05:04] exactly known actually know the way he
[00:05:07] wasn't the show it was exactly how he
[00:05:09] happened we only feel that once you know
[00:05:11] it was crazy I mean I was so lucky I
[00:05:14] didn't feel anything I mean I did my
[00:05:17] choice I I nail it haha I'm very proud
[00:05:20] of it so yeah for me was a great
[00:05:22] experience that's what I mean when I
[00:05:24] when I went to Los Angles work will film
[00:05:26] the show I was just prepared to just
[00:05:28] nail my challenge me I'm so happy for
[00:05:30] that of course I would have very nice to
[00:05:33] work be happy if I if I could win but
[00:05:34] mean there is no mean you can't deny
[00:05:38] that what other contestant ly ly Criss
[00:05:40] Angel that was very impressive to me
[00:05:42] congrats to him of course for the was a
[00:05:44] great show also wrong white the former
[00:05:47] you ever really great I mean I think he
[00:05:49] was very entertaining probably the most
[00:05:51] entertaining of all their whole house is
[00:05:53] the greater yeah I mean mean featuring
[00:05:56] these skills that we we have a man come
[00:06:00] to be i think is a great reward yeah and
[00:06:03] now I mean I like you a lot because you
[00:06:06] practice just like I do with the memory
[00:06:09] stuff that's I think how we kind of
[00:06:10] connect because we know both that our
[00:06:12] skills are are learnt and trained but um
[00:06:17] even though we say that I still think
[00:06:20] that you are just very good with numbers
[00:06:22] but I maybe that's because you were
[00:06:24] brought up with numbers i remember once
[00:06:25] you told me that as a kid I don't have
[00:06:28] was because of your father or just you
[00:06:29] but with baseball in Cuba you're always
[00:06:32] looking up the scores you're like kind
[00:06:34] of fixated on numbers from a young age
[00:06:36] right yeah exactly in my case may be
[00:06:39] loved and numbers mean I don't know man
[00:06:41] I always I always loved number so maybe
[00:06:44] I have something on my jeans I I can't
[00:06:47] deny that but I'm sure that I without
[00:06:49] practice that would be nowhere right
[00:06:50] meeting right now I mean you said for me
[00:06:52] it's a combination of maybe having the
[00:06:54] talent and also the practice now in my
[00:06:56] opinion that practice even more
[00:06:57] important at the time because it's a
[00:06:59] nice sausage that you either have it or
[00:07:00] not that's ok you know that is not you
[00:07:02] can do about it but the practice is
[00:07:04] something that you can definitely
[00:07:05] improve bye-bye just working really hard
[00:07:09] and I'm sorry I was blessed because my
[00:07:11] father he said its a math he's a math
[00:07:13] professor also my mother so definitely
[00:07:15] that helps a lot so because I I start
[00:07:19] getting since early age that culture of
[00:07:22] math and that was worried that was very
[00:07:25] useful for me but yeah like you say I
[00:07:27] love baseball when I was a kid love
[00:07:29] baseball and I like to I like to figure
[00:07:30] out the average of a guy who was going
[00:07:34] to bat and I'm on five hits in 12 times
[00:07:37] that means like for the 17 hours i was
[00:07:39] able to memorize those numbers in yet i
[00:07:41] know that i was very passionate moaning
[00:07:43] Kemp's when it comes to number yeah but
[00:07:45] again we thought the practice I will be
[00:07:46] nowhere right now yeah yeah that's good
[00:07:49] i think people really need to hear that
[00:07:50] sometimes it it's especially on that
[00:07:53] show I'm sure everybody pretty much
[00:07:55] everybody on that show is in the same
[00:07:56] boat that there's I was talking about
[00:07:58] board lures that there's some strategy
[00:08:01] and that is practice in my opinion you
[00:08:04] use need to have the motivation for me I
[00:08:06] love number so it wasn't hard for me but
[00:08:09] in general you just need to find your
[00:08:10] passion for me was a number 44 or
[00:08:12] someone else could be anything me at all
[00:08:14] just find your passion work hard for it
[00:08:16] in my case me I was I love numbers i
[00:08:19] wanted to participate in cutting
[00:08:20] champion she's all around the world I
[00:08:21] couldn't do that didn't have the money i
[00:08:23] was living in Cuba I was a professor at
[00:08:25] the University of Havana i was making
[00:08:26] like twenty dollars a month so i didn't
[00:08:28] have the you know the economy for that
[00:08:31] so I realized that I need I needed to do
[00:08:33] something else so what I did was
[00:08:36] actually try to break a guinness world
[00:08:37] record incoming of days and once I did
[00:08:39] it I was able to get sponsors to that
[00:08:42] let me you know the chance to be part of
[00:08:45] the main technical asian work up I think
[00:08:47] I think that does that's probably I
[00:08:49] would say the holes don't be mine my
[00:08:51] main and I was every war yes yeah that's
[00:08:55] nice yeah so wait let's let's talk about
[00:08:58] the flash again so the in terms of how
[00:09:02] you do it I remember I mean they made
[00:09:04] you wait to build tension I guess before
[00:09:07] you said the answer yes and I notice i
[00:09:09] said to myself at least for the first
[00:09:11] the first run I was like you know what I
[00:09:13] could have just memorized those numbers
[00:09:15] and then figure it out and all the time
[00:09:17] you gave them but I mean whether you did
[00:09:19] that or not it's still
[00:09:21] afterwards with the faster it's it's
[00:09:23] almost impossible yeah in case idea of
[00:09:26] my eyes the numbers i just calculated
[00:09:27] actually they they wanted me to hold my
[00:09:30] answer for a big i'm most probably more
[00:09:32] challenging then you're saying the
[00:09:34] answer right away but did you say can
[00:09:36] you hold the answer for 30 seconds it
[00:09:39] was like okay let me try that but I mean
[00:09:42] but you had the answer right it's so I
[00:09:44] had the edge I prolly two seconds later
[00:09:46] or maybe less um yeah let me make you
[00:09:49] like do I got it so that makes me feel a
[00:09:54] little bad I'm sorry I'm sorry no I'm
[00:09:56] gonna show me but but again miss it
[00:09:59] shows so you have to understand that if
[00:10:01] they want to something maybe you want to
[00:10:03] be flexible and if you mean if you feel
[00:10:05] coughing you would have no problem with
[00:10:07] it yeah and so in terms of how you do
[00:10:09] that rapidly obviously it's practiced
[00:10:11] but if you have to break it down right
[00:10:13] so they were doing two digit numbers
[00:10:15] right so from what I understand you can
[00:10:18] probably explain this better is
[00:10:19] obviously you see the first number you
[00:10:21] know mentally where that is say 55 and
[00:10:24] then you get the next number how are you
[00:10:26] adding that it's you do like a left to
[00:10:29] right thing right yes i do i do it from
[00:10:31] left to right so come when you do 55
[00:10:33] plus 72 I just say 512 I'm the 500 to
[00:10:38] 700 127 so far so I'm pretty much you
[00:10:41] left to right just keep in mind that
[00:10:42] sometimes might be hard because I don't
[00:10:44] know maybe you have 55 + 88 so in that
[00:10:47] case to various five honey will be 13
[00:10:50] but the other team that means you have
[00:10:51] to carry on to the bridge with 143 so
[00:10:53] you have to put that definitely left to
[00:10:55] right it's faster and that's probably
[00:10:58] the only way is possibly normally and
[00:11:00] it's close the teacher to add from right
[00:11:02] and from right to left which is ok you
[00:11:04] know if you want to do with pencil but
[00:11:06] if you wanna do mentally let a left to
[00:11:08] right is the right direction and now
[00:11:10] every time the new number of lashes do
[00:11:13] already have the answer from the
[00:11:15] previous some or yes yes i do i do have
[00:11:18] the angles of it sometimes it's so fast
[00:11:20] that what i do it i made like two blocks
[00:11:23] maybe with the first five numbers i have
[00:11:25] a partial answer and keep it out of my
[00:11:27] mind you know yeah and then we do the
[00:11:30] five numbers I just do the same thing
[00:11:32] and then finally that maybe that
[00:11:33] particular
[00:11:34] 23 seconds morn just probably go I just
[00:11:37] put into it yeah so yeah sometimes
[00:11:39] that's what it is depending on how fast
[00:11:40] it is sometimes it's so fast ya need to
[00:11:43] split in two blocks at least that's
[00:11:44] crazy and I assume that because of
[00:11:47] practice and doing it at first you know
[00:11:48] you were slower but when you do it on
[00:11:50] the show for example or now it's almost
[00:11:54] a feeling right like if I say 2 plus 8i
[00:11:57] wants to be like eight nine ten not know
[00:12:00] it's ten but you exactly do that the
[00:12:02] same way they say whether you need to
[00:12:03] know your tables you need to know your a
[00:12:05] ditch in fact don't need to know how
[00:12:06] yeah there's a minute look back at some
[00:12:08] point right and in mind in my case I
[00:12:10] actually I expand my addiction facts to
[00:12:12] all the way to a hundred so when you say
[00:12:13] fifty fifty eight plus 27 you need to
[00:12:15] know right away what the answer is no
[00:12:17] the answer is 85 you need to know those
[00:12:19] things right away and also knowing your
[00:12:22] compliments i'm going to smile at me
[00:12:23] later knowing your complex is very
[00:12:25] useful for example when I have the 55
[00:12:28] plus idiot that was before the way
[00:12:29] actually do is the following I know that
[00:12:31] 88 what I call the compliment would be
[00:12:33] the number that you need to add up to
[00:12:35] get a hundred for some of the compliment
[00:12:36] 88 will be 12 right because 88 + 12 is a
[00:12:40] hundred so when I do 50 I Brooke 55 + 88
[00:12:44] what I do I just subtract the compliment
[00:12:46] 50 5-12 will be 43 and then add a
[00:12:50] hundred so 143 so pretty much by by
[00:12:53] knowing the compliments instead of
[00:12:55] adding you decide to subtract that small
[00:12:57] compliment when I have like a huge
[00:12:58] number like 98 I know 98 is so simple to
[00:13:01] add or do i want to subtract two and
[00:13:03] then add a hundred so using those rules
[00:13:06] or it's very definite very useful
[00:13:08] because you will have at least four or
[00:13:10] five big numbers that if you use a
[00:13:12] compliment you will save time and you'll
[00:13:15] be more accurate yeah I remember when I
[00:13:17] first got into memory mind stuff the
[00:13:20] first thing that fascinated me the most
[00:13:21] was mental calculation I'm okay I'm not
[00:13:25] like you and I didn't know about
[00:13:28] techniques you know and I started
[00:13:30] researching books and techniques and
[00:13:34] stuff and I found out about vedic math
[00:13:37] Scott Flansburg has a book or there's
[00:13:40] all these things out there that teach
[00:13:43] you about compliments
[00:13:44] and faster ways to do the cross
[00:13:47] multiplication and stuff like that and
[00:13:48] square roots and all that I thought that
[00:13:50] was fascinating that you could there are
[00:13:52] all these shortcuts to map that they
[00:13:54] don't even teach you in school you know
[00:13:56] and and that's the part of me the one
[00:13:58] thing that we I'm fighting for is why
[00:14:01] not in doing those Turkish on you know
[00:14:02] in all the schools I think I think when
[00:14:05] it comes to memory and mental my
[00:14:07] calculations we are way behind other
[00:14:08] countries and I think it's because I
[00:14:11] think it's because we we don't teach all
[00:14:13] the kids in the schools if you see
[00:14:14] people in India they they have a lot of
[00:14:16] a school so just memory and mental
[00:14:18] calculation i mean when i see that it's
[00:14:20] like wow we need to do the same us we
[00:14:22] are we're a great country we are you
[00:14:24] know why not why not so definitely
[00:14:27] knowing those shortcuts or we'll make
[00:14:30] we'll make our students better at math
[00:14:32] and run event of forcing in memorization
[00:14:35] I know I know I know you use lot of
[00:14:37] techniques and I think knowing those
[00:14:39] those sneaks that's the best way to
[00:14:41] learn and you think and again I'm
[00:14:44] fighting for for this we just created
[00:14:46] another thing that is called Hector
[00:14:47] which is a nap there's very yeah so you
[00:14:51] can ask me late about that if you want
[00:14:54] mean we're trying to innovate with frogs
[00:14:58] so we can we can we can have you know we
[00:15:00] can have our students excited about this
[00:15:02] yeah so two things I want to mention is
[00:15:05] the heck talk in a second but the more
[00:15:09] on on the general idea you just said in
[00:15:11] terms of teaching kids these techniques
[00:15:13] you have a company called spicy math
[00:15:15] right yes yes bison you teach this stuff
[00:15:18] too yeah yeah especially spicy man it's
[00:15:22] a company is it to learn company so for
[00:15:24] example we are mainly focused on the
[00:15:26] SATs exams which as you know our kind of
[00:15:29] like no hard but let's say you have to
[00:15:32] answer the question pretty fast because
[00:15:34] it doesn't matter if you know the answer
[00:15:35] in five minutes you need to know the
[00:15:36] answer in less than a minute so having
[00:15:39] those mental calculation shortcuts and
[00:15:41] those vaporization techniques will
[00:15:43] definitely give you the edge to be in
[00:15:45] the top five percent of the country
[00:15:47] because nobody else is doing that right
[00:15:49] yeah everyone using use a great tutor
[00:15:51] I've asked him for a lot of tips already
[00:15:54] even I would teach her I'm good at math
[00:15:56] that's what I grew up in and did in
[00:15:58] school and I had students that i tutored
[00:16:00] that eventually i just gave to use me
[00:16:02] because it was not right that's right
[00:16:04] and now actually there is this kid I you
[00:16:07] know Manny he was doing the PSAT last
[00:16:11] the last year i think it was used to
[00:16:14] like forty two percent are now he's
[00:16:16] doing a 97 percentile he's doing great
[00:16:18] so so I'm telling you with practice you
[00:16:21] can be ahead of the whole population
[00:16:24] because unfortunately nobody else is
[00:16:25] doing this yeah so do by doing this you
[00:16:28] know people are going and getting an
[00:16:30] inch yeah that's good to hear but also a
[00:16:34] den haak tech talk so you have an app
[00:16:37] for this I've seen you post it all time
[00:16:39] every day you've almost put a new it's
[00:16:41] almost like a puzzle a math puzzle right
[00:16:42] yes Hector is a math puzzle pretty much
[00:16:45] this it's like also likes to talk 0444
[00:16:48] numbers so consistent in given 650
[00:16:51] numbers given 65 123456 just add
[00:16:55] addition subtraction multiplication
[00:16:56] division to make it in hand so you have
[00:16:58] to build an expression that give you
[00:17:00] that one you find the value of that
[00:17:02] expression should be 100 and it's very
[00:17:04] challenging at the beginning but we
[00:17:06] created this app that it goes by levels
[00:17:09] so while a level 10 the only thing you
[00:17:11] need to do is just add 1 1 operation and
[00:17:15] so you can get used to to the game and
[00:17:17] little by little you you're building
[00:17:20] your you know like a massive strategies
[00:17:22] how to solve the problem and King coming
[00:17:25] out with the right expression might be
[00:17:26] challenging but I keep that expand your
[00:17:28] expand your mind so you can be better at
[00:17:31] math and as you know numbers is the most
[00:17:33] basic thing that you need to know in
[00:17:35] order to resent man so I think we serve
[00:17:37] from there we can have great results
[00:17:39] that's great yeah I haven't downloaded
[00:17:41] yet but I've done some of the ones you
[00:17:43] post on Facebook and they're good i love
[00:17:44] that stuff yeah you'll see you'll see
[00:17:48] level one is super easy level two is a
[00:17:50] little more complicated but you get used
[00:17:51] to the feeling of building the
[00:17:52] expression which sometimes we know how
[00:17:54] to do it but when it comes to actually
[00:17:56] put it on paper we don't know exactly
[00:17:58] where what what we should put which
[00:18:00] sometimes we don't even know i found a
[00:18:02] lot of college students they don't even
[00:18:03] know the order of operations Hector's
[00:18:05] finish a way to to
[00:18:08] make sure you understand the right order
[00:18:09] of operation which is parenthesis the
[00:18:10] exponents then multiplication division
[00:18:12] depending which one goes first half
[00:18:14] baths and then addition subtraction
[00:18:15] depending on which one goes first so
[00:18:17] again a lot of people don't know the
[00:18:19] order of operation that's kind of bad
[00:18:21] because that's the most makes you think
[00:18:23] you need to know about math yeah when
[00:18:24] people post those things on Facebook
[00:18:26] what's the answer to this expression and
[00:18:28] there's parentheses and all these
[00:18:30] different things order of operations and
[00:18:32] the amount of people that get it wrong
[00:18:35] it's just so sad yeah totally there is
[00:18:38] always led top 50% I was like a 50 for
[00:18:41] sale fortunately we need to change that
[00:18:43] I know it'd be huge challenge but again
[00:18:45] I feel strong and I'm John like you so I
[00:18:48] know I'm gonna be right at this my whole
[00:18:49] life the best thing about those things
[00:18:51] is that your everybody comments and most
[00:18:53] of them are incorrect but then the one
[00:18:55] guy who knows math puts the right answer
[00:18:57] and then the people who did it wrong or
[00:18:59] like no that's wrong what are you
[00:19:00] talking about you know exactly I the
[00:19:03] other day I read this comic is both it
[00:19:05] was like someone like somebody who got
[00:19:07] the answer wrong I say it's simple its
[00:19:09] order of operation I said really yeah
[00:19:12] it's simple to write me don't know for
[00:19:14] sure but you got it wrong that means you
[00:19:15] don't know so you know that that you
[00:19:17] have to false around them or you don't
[00:19:18] know the right order so important wait
[00:19:20] to change that yeah um that's very you
[00:19:25] know one thing also you're good at
[00:19:27] memory um you don't we've talked about
[00:19:29] the techniques I think you understand
[00:19:31] them and maybe you've tried it but I
[00:19:32] think naturally you're very good at like
[00:19:35] you said before you're good with numbers
[00:19:36] so I remember I've seen you on a was it
[00:19:39] in Miami show or just a Cuban show wait
[00:19:42] I think wasn't miami-dade the one that
[00:19:44] did show me a number for a second or a
[00:19:45] sexologist right yes yeah yeah amy is a
[00:19:49] brownie come to short-term memory I'm
[00:19:51] pretty good at it so for something you
[00:19:53] show me number for one second and you
[00:19:55] can jump up like a face like 12 e none
[00:19:57] will be safe for me 15 will be more
[00:19:59] challenging yeah I can't recall the
[00:20:02] number just by looking at one second the
[00:20:04] 15 deeds and and yeah pretty much that
[00:20:07] I'm used and using pretty much no
[00:20:09] technique i'm using a little a little
[00:20:11] teeny but it's pretty much I all say
[00:20:14] it's called eidetic memory right yeah I
[00:20:17] did yeah uh-huh so nothing much what I
[00:20:21] but yeah when it comes to stop you need
[00:20:23] to use techniques of course otherwise
[00:20:25] you will forget right away yeah but I
[00:20:27] think what's interesting is that's the
[00:20:29] importance and and of what you call
[00:20:33] number sense right growing up your
[00:20:35] number sense like having it in your life
[00:20:38] from a young age obviously having
[00:20:40] parents that are mathematicians and
[00:20:41] being interested in sports helps but you
[00:20:44] know if you in America everybody's so
[00:20:47] scared of math and numbers and everybody
[00:20:49] so bad and I think it's poorly taught
[00:20:50] but if it's given to kids at a young age
[00:20:53] is the right way that's fun and
[00:20:55] interesting like imagine the things you
[00:20:57] can grow up to do like being able to
[00:20:59] just four important numbers without much
[00:21:01] effort and then with practice you're
[00:21:03] better yeah of course I believe the
[00:21:05] assisting i'm wearing is actually not
[00:21:07] good at me well when you look at the
[00:21:08] system in paper that curriculum in paper
[00:21:10] is actually great so we we have done so
[00:21:12] many things that in paper they look
[00:21:14] awesome but in real life we don't apply
[00:21:17] those to think correctly are my freedom
[00:21:19] fries because of the professor or maybe
[00:21:20] because the system is just too broad
[00:21:22] that we want to do so many things that
[00:21:24] we don't end up doing nothing it my
[00:21:26] opinion women need to do less things go
[00:21:29] more dead you know like having a sense
[00:21:31] of number people don't need to know how
[00:21:33] to add fractions so so those are basic
[00:21:35] things that you will use of your whole
[00:21:37] life when you go chopping you need to
[00:21:39] decide what that means that that does
[00:21:40] sign that says twenty-five percent off
[00:21:42] you need to know what that means get one
[00:21:44] by ahead you know by one game where you
[00:21:46] need to know that you would get at Los
[00:21:47] 25% food because of that in you need to
[00:21:50] know so many things that are so basic so
[00:21:52] important that I think if we use focus
[00:21:54] on those things like numbers algebra
[00:21:56] we're gonna do great yeah yeah cool
[00:21:59] let's talk about the days i love this
[00:22:02] stuff um ok i just test you on a couple
[00:22:05] of you mind of course supporting all
[00:22:07] right I'll do this one cuz I know it is
[00:22:09] februari fourth 1984 all your birthday
[00:22:13] yeah born on Saturday thank you it's
[00:22:17] good all right let's try i'm gonna look
[00:22:18] at the calendar here let's try something
[00:22:20] this year can you do okay here yeah okay
[00:22:23] 34 disused will be a third nipple yeah
[00:22:25] okay anything let's say
[00:22:27] june of this year of 16th Thursday Wow
[00:22:32] yep that's fast all right let's try
[00:22:35] November 29th Tuesday that's good all
[00:22:39] right let's try in the past okay okay
[00:22:44] and it has been gallery here no let's
[00:22:47] try I'm gonna do over the year let's say
[00:22:51] 2011 nothing lemon I'm actually I know
[00:22:53] this one may13 2011 writing no was a
[00:23:01] Friday yeah I was writing the day that I
[00:23:02] work for the summit of Everest and I'm
[00:23:04] almost afraid 135 day five Wow yeah I
[00:23:09] hold on one second let's see let me do
[00:23:13] it this way so how far back can you go
[00:23:19] one in fury we can go as far as 1582
[00:23:23] because before I 1582 there were so many
[00:23:25] kind of that is hard to say the day of
[00:23:27] the week but if we go all the way to
[00:23:29] 1582 like love when the gregorian the
[00:23:33] Pope Gary Gorian yeah he installed you
[00:23:36] know he proposed the current day would
[00:23:38] encounter all right let's try 1965 1955
[00:23:42] August ninth not a Monday that's what
[00:23:49] all right let's try 18th century and
[00:23:53] then I'm going to stop this is like
[00:23:56] child's play to you uh first for me is
[00:23:58] like fun so don't worry okay all right
[00:24:01] let's try 1891 1881 December 10th the
[00:24:08] whole service out of it december 10
[00:24:10] sorry i was a thursday the other yeah
[00:24:13] that's good cool so a lot of people
[00:24:17] don't know that there's actually a
[00:24:18] formula for this but you have a version
[00:24:22] of it where it's just like you're all
[00:24:24] you're doing is some quick edition right
[00:24:26] back to when you told me 1891 December
[00:24:28] 10th what I did in my head was 91 + 23
[00:24:31] because when you find anyone by for that
[00:24:33] gives you somehow the number of leap
[00:24:35] days that'll be twenty-two points
[00:24:37] something you always round up so 23 91%
[00:24:39] agrees is 14
[00:24:41] plus three more because a that 19th
[00:24:43] century such 19th century you ask me
[00:24:45] it's actually three more so I just be
[00:24:50] 117 right so 91 let me do it again but
[00:24:53] we were 31 17 a half plus there will be
[00:24:55] 1 27 plus 3 because for me the same
[00:24:57] reason 3 is 1 30 you know 130 when you
[00:25:01] divide by 7 the remainder is for when
[00:25:04] the remainder is 1 is a Mondrian very
[00:25:05] nice to see Tuesday why's it on these
[00:25:07] four of course a Thursday fighter is a
[00:25:09] friday saturday and 0 will be a sunday
[00:25:11] of course after you practice for a while
[00:25:14] you tend to memorize intermediate
[00:25:16] results I didn't mean to memorize them
[00:25:18] but yeah so how your practice point that
[00:25:20] you by practicing you you eat just come
[00:25:23] to your mind right away so hey let's
[00:25:25] break it down for a second just so
[00:25:26] people get it so 18th century there's a
[00:25:30] number associated with the century right
[00:25:32] exactly so we have a number for the year
[00:25:33] it will a year and we just think that
[00:25:35] year yeah doesn't matter and we need to
[00:25:38] divide it by selling 191 right exactly
[00:25:40] like year 91 exact 90 180 91 beat 91 and
[00:25:44] we did you could actually do the
[00:25:46] division by seven already if you want
[00:25:47] right well exactly 90 want to do so by
[00:25:50] saying you'll pretty much forget about
[00:25:51] the 91 part yes you can do that of
[00:25:53] course the good thing about these
[00:25:55] methods that you can / 7 at any time and
[00:25:57] you just get the remainder and you can
[00:25:58] continue right I just be clear you only
[00:26:00] need the remainder you don't actually
[00:26:01] need the exact so so let's listen come
[00:26:05] again you I got the 91 and I'm divided
[00:26:07] that by four and at one when you divide
[00:26:09] n 1 by 4 is 22 points something almost
[00:26:12] 23 let's see let's get 22 but because
[00:26:15] you always have to add one anyway so
[00:26:16] will be 23 the whole talk okay so 91
[00:26:20] plus 23 would be 140 okay then we have a
[00:26:23] number for the century for me 1973 which
[00:26:27] is 18 something 19th centuries always
[00:26:29] plus 3 okay if it is 20 century will be
[00:26:32] plus one if it is this entry the 21st
[00:26:35] have to be 0 and that's just figured out
[00:26:37] somewhere you just memorize that right X
[00:26:40] I just know the good thing is that
[00:26:42] you'll need to memorize for centuries
[00:26:44] because every 400 years everything's
[00:26:46] gonna repeat yeah so if you want to do
[00:26:48] the 25th century now be the sense at
[00:26:50] 21st so you don't need to memorize what
[00:26:52] I do I just memorize this the
[00:26:54] 18th century the 19th century and 20th
[00:26:57] century and the 21st century that's it
[00:26:58] veterans and then it repeats so for me
[00:27:03] the nineteen seventy plus three so we
[00:27:05] had 91 prosperity was 114 row three more
[00:27:07] 117 then you add the day you say day 10
[00:27:11] so 1 17 plus 10 will be 1 20 second
[00:27:14] right and then finally which is probably
[00:27:17] you know things you have yeah that's
[00:27:19] your the other thing that you have to
[00:27:20] memorize for each month you need to know
[00:27:23] number for me December was number three
[00:27:25] ok I'll do it away that I sir but
[00:27:27] generally being a five februari being
[00:27:29] one you know so and so on for me the
[00:27:32] same will be number three so that 127
[00:27:34] these two you need to add 3 to that one
[00:27:36] 27 you get 130 that's real total ok and
[00:27:40] that 130 you need to divide it by seven
[00:27:42] when you divide 130 by seven you don't
[00:27:45] care about the cool you don't care about
[00:27:46] the result you only care about the
[00:27:48] remainder the left over you know the
[00:27:50] left over when you when you do it seven
[00:27:53] goals exactly 19 times actually 18 times
[00:27:56] doesn't 18 times in 2 130 because they
[00:27:59] think that same is 126 so you're having
[00:28:02] left over for you know and remainder of
[00:28:04] for when the remainder is 0 would be a
[00:28:06] Sunday one is a monday to sit you sit
[00:28:08] through the 14 in this case it was a
[00:28:10] Thursday so yeah I know it takes more
[00:28:13] time to explain that to do believe me at
[00:28:15] the beginning it's hard but once you get
[00:28:18] used to it it's actually pretty simple
[00:28:20] stuff that if you have practice as much
[00:28:22] as it good it will come to you kind of
[00:28:24] natural yeah and like you said a lot of
[00:28:26] it is is just knowing a code for the
[00:28:30] century for the the day of the week and
[00:28:32] then we call it the month write them up
[00:28:35] so pretty much you told you go with your
[00:28:37] brother yeah four numbers for for each
[00:28:40] of the four centuries that we're talking
[00:28:41] about because it's gonna repeat anyway
[00:28:43] after four centers and twelve numbers
[00:28:45] for each month you know and and yeah
[00:28:49] knowing that serious is it sounding on
[00:28:51] that that maybe answer anyway because
[00:28:53] that the first day of the week made for
[00:28:56] you if you were you'd like to say this
[00:28:57] monday then the second one day is
[00:28:58] tuesday it's just magical things yeah
[00:29:01] that's cool and so what's your record
[00:29:02] right now my brother right now is
[00:29:05] calculate
[00:29:05] let a 111 dates in one minute that's
[00:29:08] great i know i know where the gates
[00:29:10] right like from Allah talking about
[00:29:12] random days between the 1600 and the
[00:29:14] 2100 so we're talking about 500 years of
[00:29:18] range you know and I need to degrade
[00:29:21] them as soon as possible and in this
[00:29:23] case of course it's not it's different
[00:29:25] it's no it's all you ask me the date and
[00:29:27] I tell they're doing because I will take
[00:29:28] longer the way it is i have to software
[00:29:31] i pretty much monic when i when i click
[00:29:33] enter a bunch of days I'm going to be
[00:29:35] displayed in front of me and if I think
[00:29:37] the first day I have to go in order I
[00:29:39] can't skip any date okay if I think the
[00:29:41] first date is a monday just press 1 on
[00:29:44] my keyboard if I think the day is a
[00:29:46] tuesday press 2 3 4 the wednesday and so
[00:29:48] on you know so pretty much I'm just
[00:29:50] pressing his for a minute and last time
[00:29:53] i did it was on tour 31st last year 2015
[00:29:56] a saturday i heard from the others not
[00:29:59] to say the other week hey i was i just i
[00:30:03] was able to press 111 correct keys in
[00:30:06] one minute that's the current record
[00:30:09] right now I have all the two other
[00:30:11] drivers in also calendar in different
[00:30:14] categories one thing is like 20 dates in
[00:30:16] the of the century of the current
[00:30:19] century so we're talking about this
[00:30:20] century in the last time possible that
[00:30:24] one ID I broke it on 2010 I was able to
[00:30:27] calculate 20 dates in 8.05 seconds
[00:30:30] that's and the third record which was
[00:30:33] also broken last October was the 365
[00:30:37] days of the year try to do it rather
[00:30:41] than the last possible no less possible
[00:30:43] time and I was able to calculate with no
[00:30:45] mistake that unit 65 days that were
[00:30:48] projected to me in random order of
[00:30:50] course in two minutes and 41 seconds
[00:30:53] that's crazy and I was planning to do it
[00:30:56] this year because its use a little more
[00:30:57] challenging because we have only have 66
[00:30:59] days because you have we have fairly 29
[00:31:01] oh yeah I think will be cool that you
[00:31:04] know but because that despite the fact
[00:31:06] that we have one more day if I can do it
[00:31:08] fast that make open the browser thinking
[00:31:10] about maybe breaking that one again this
[00:31:12] year
[00:31:12] you look at every four years exactly
[00:31:14] yeah that's fine and so with that's that
[00:31:17] skill obviously you practice it tons
[00:31:20] when did you start doing this or when
[00:31:22] did you decide sister I actually I
[00:31:25] actually started when I was like 22 ok
[00:31:28] I'm 33 right now so forward 11 before 22
[00:31:31] you didn't know how to do this no I
[00:31:32] didn't know how to do this actually I
[00:31:34] was 22 when I found out about the
[00:31:36] manipulation work cup and I wanted to go
[00:31:39] I wanted to go I actually I back then i
[00:31:41] was living in havana cuba i was i was in
[00:31:44] my my I think across the senior the
[00:31:47] junior at the University of Havana
[00:31:49] starting to criticize and I wanted to
[00:31:52] participate i created this competition
[00:31:54] at the University of Havana with using
[00:31:56] the same format as a real as a real
[00:31:58] medical workup I want the competition I
[00:32:00] wasn't able to go because I didn't have
[00:32:02] the morning I was hoping to find
[00:32:04] sponsors but I couldn't so I say well I
[00:32:06] have to do something else let me try to
[00:32:07] break a record and then I start doing
[00:32:10] the candidates I was successful and I
[00:32:12] start doing it when I was 22 i created
[00:32:15] my own algerie which is the one that i
[00:32:17] was mentioning later I find out that a
[00:32:19] lot of people doing kind of the same
[00:32:20] algorithm for me in my in my opinion my
[00:32:22] organ is actually pretty good cousin
[00:32:24] that because we have the 400 years
[00:32:26] things that was telling you before every
[00:32:28] 400 years everything repeats so the idea
[00:32:30] in a way that the 21st century which is
[00:32:32] a very eccentric is serum so I don't
[00:32:35] have to add anything which means that
[00:32:36] also the 17th century is also still
[00:32:38] searches or all of the 500 range of
[00:32:41] years i have 200 years you know 200 yeah
[00:32:45] 200 years that i don't have to add
[00:32:46] anything which makes me maybe dinner
[00:32:48] facet yeah but again it's not only about
[00:32:50] doing math really fast you have to
[00:32:52] coordinate a lot of things you have to
[00:32:53] coordinate your fingers to answer as
[00:32:55] fast as they can you know there are a
[00:32:57] lot of details that you don't know the
[00:32:59] best way to practice for a competition
[00:33:00] is to do exactly what the competition's
[00:33:02] is required is requires you to do so
[00:33:05] what I do normally have fun a lot of
[00:33:08] shortcuts on the road that the way Mia
[00:33:11] was able to do maybe 30 days and I was
[00:33:12] proud oh wow 30 days in many dollars
[00:33:14] that's amazing you know and it is it is
[00:33:16] actually amazing I remember my first
[00:33:18] record I did like 42 digs and for me was
[00:33:20] like wow me I thought it was important
[00:33:23] to something more than
[00:33:24] but then later I found out all the other
[00:33:26] tricks like for example the way one
[00:33:29] thing that I do when I'm answering one
[00:33:31] day i'm calculating the next one so I'm
[00:33:33] kind of multitasking there so those are
[00:33:37] things that you mean you will only find
[00:33:38] out if you just try hard yeah yeah so it
[00:33:41] could cross a question just because I'm
[00:33:43] curious so when let's say in nineteen I
[00:33:47] mean 2035 februari forth what they will
[00:33:52] be my brother they it'll be you'll be
[00:33:54] something sorry I don't Sunday okay yeah
[00:33:56] all right I'll show 35 when I turned
[00:33:59] that the year I'll let you know if it
[00:34:02] actually was I mean I can also add more
[00:34:05] fun that way you would turn a 51 right
[00:34:07] yeah I guess yeah let me I want to do
[00:34:10] the math i'll let you do that alright so
[00:34:13] one more question before we go what's
[00:34:16] next with what are your plans for this
[00:34:18] year we're going next mission is just to
[00:34:21] keep growing you know you have to
[00:34:23] inspire a lot of people to do the same
[00:34:25] thing as you so our next immediate
[00:34:28] challenge would be i'm going to be part
[00:34:29] of the organization of the memorial 2016
[00:34:31] oh yeah which by the way i would like to
[00:34:33] invite everyone that is watching us
[00:34:35] right now to erase your as soon as
[00:34:37] possible because we have we have limited
[00:34:40] train station so I'm the bank of the
[00:34:42] number of people that weren't racer
[00:34:43] we're going to select the best you know
[00:34:45] so we want to increase the number of
[00:34:47] countries participating this memorial
[00:34:50] this year so we definitely am looking
[00:34:52] forward to see all your automotive
[00:34:54] registration so yeah it's a little big
[00:34:56] the registration open i think is open i
[00:34:59] can double check that later but yeah i
[00:35:01] think is open right now in the memorial
[00:35:02] website so you use those doggy door
[00:35:04] little memorial com don't forget
[00:35:07] memorial m e + 0 RI a decomp you can
[00:35:12] raise her if now i will find out what is
[00:35:14] going on and next we can promise i will
[00:35:16] be up yeah that's it las vegas it's a
[00:35:19] combination of mental math and memory so
[00:35:22] I'll be there this is the but this is
[00:35:24] very interesting a competition winner
[00:35:25] this week yeah well I you say we're
[00:35:27] combining mental calculation memory fast
[00:35:29] reading even fast video is going to be
[00:35:31] there so here if you feel like you wanna
[00:35:33] you can print fast or you can just make
[00:35:35] more
[00:35:35] things or you just like to do
[00:35:37] metacognition this is the competition
[00:35:39] for you we do once every four years so
[00:35:42] you don't want to miss this one unless
[00:35:44] you want to wait until 2020 you know so
[00:35:48] yeah I correct you encourage you to
[00:35:50] compete in this in this gray and
[00:35:52] competition Las Vegas is going to be in
[00:35:54] November so just start making plans
[00:35:57] there you go cool well be back in Miami
[00:36:00] soon and we do some stuff together again
[00:36:03] so spicy math calms your website check
[00:36:06] it out if you want to learn more about
[00:36:08] use near his app is in the app store
[00:36:10] heck talk I think it's prime time is
[00:36:12] right hcc toc yes i'll put a link okay
[00:36:17] perfect so hectic com that's it that's
[00:36:19] the app you want to try to be better at
[00:36:20] math yeah and then you have a book I
[00:36:22] think I've amazon right I have a half a
[00:36:24] book with this which is 40 safe for
[00:36:27] beginners if you don't know anything
[00:36:28] about the mental condition where word
[00:36:30] this is a book for you this call method
[00:36:33] glitch of war a mint take a glacial
[00:36:36] basic curse cool alright well thanks so
[00:36:39] much you sneer good luck I'll see you
[00:36:42] soon no thank you that's all I know you
[00:36:44] cannot be doing great things you you are
[00:36:46] the four times us memory champion I know
[00:36:48] I know you love doing what you do so I
[00:36:50] again um it would be my pleasure to meet
[00:36:53] you again here Miami and there is a lot
[00:36:55] that we need to discuss all yeah let's
[00:36:57] go for you let's go and this year I'm
[00:36:59] gonna finally figure out how to do those
[00:37:01] square roots fast great ready and i will
[00:37:03] food out to the song meant it so many
[00:37:06] things and maybe maybe can go to us

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMFwpXsjwJc

[00:00:08] snowing outside I need to go outside I
[00:00:11] need to see the snow you could play in
[00:00:13] the snow your film in the snow it's
[00:00:15] awesome got to see this now all right I
[00:00:37] have a problem big problem don't know
[00:00:40] how to solve it figure out a way but I
[00:00:42] don't know how to solve it right now I
[00:00:44] have 330 actually more books as you saw
[00:00:49] in the last video that i printed got
[00:00:52] shipped them out to 330 people by hand
[00:00:56] by hand
[00:01:18] this is my favorite Street our path Rose
[00:01:23] whatever in Central Park it's the one
[00:01:25] with where couples like walk down arm in
[00:01:28] arm and all the movies she's beautiful
[00:01:30] right now with the snow it's awesome I'm
[00:01:33] the only person here usually it's in
[00:01:35] crowded you can never get that one shot
[00:01:36] down the middle like this well that's
[00:01:39] nice nobody there but me Leah where the
[00:01:44] are you quit your job already
[00:01:48] even your police gotta stop taking
[00:01:50] pictures so i guess you can individually
[00:01:53] wrap each one i'm going to try the post
[00:01:56] office and see if I can get some
[00:01:57] envelopes its really snowing
[00:01:59] also kind of memorize stuff later
[00:02:02] hashtag memory athlete by one point with
[00:02:09] if they don't have a line back covering
[00:02:10] each one you I really watch all right so
[00:02:29] I've got I've got an interview with some
[00:02:38] really exciting in the next 20 minutes
[00:02:40] this guy I've been waiting to talk to
[00:02:43] this guy for years I've never met him
[00:02:45] he's not a memory got well we'll see
[00:02:48] he's a mental calculator does crazy
[00:02:52] stuff his name is rüdiger gam gam
[00:02:54] rüdiger gam I don't know how to
[00:02:56] pronounce it he's German he was on the
[00:02:58] show years ago kind of the first show
[00:03:00] that ever told me about mental
[00:03:02] calculations and memory stuff and I was
[00:03:07] hooked so this guy is known for most
[00:03:09] many things being able to being able to
[00:03:14] take a number i think a two digit number
[00:03:17] and power raised it to the certain power
[00:03:20] two digit power so like think of 5
[00:03:24] squared right it's 25 a lot of these we
[00:03:27] know 9 squared 8110 squared hundred but
[00:03:31] he knows like you do like 21 to the 18th
[00:03:35] power which ends up being like a ton of
[00:03:37] numbers so but he'll just like rattle
[00:03:41] them off I've always been curious
[00:03:42] because i don't really know or think
[00:03:44] he's member well I don't really think or
[00:03:47] know that he's calculating them I think
[00:03:50] he's memorized them or parts of them
[00:03:53] anyways super fascinating can't wait to
[00:03:55] talk to the guy select any two digit
[00:03:58] number let's say 74 to the third power
[00:04:02] 405,000 224 yeah I see the number like a
[00:04:06] computer screen that it'll be like
[00:04:08] Terminator that guy
[00:04:10] is insane like I always expected him to
[00:04:14] be a false like a fake just memorizing
[00:04:16] stuff and even though he admitted that
[00:04:19] he does which I guess is fine he clearly
[00:04:23] has a gift which you know after doing
[00:04:27] the memory thing for so long I'd never
[00:04:29] I'd highly suspect people who claim they
[00:04:33] have a gift in terms of memory stuff or
[00:04:35] mine stuff that they don't that it's
[00:04:37] some trick that they're hiding or using
[00:04:40] and I thought he was doing that and
[00:04:43] everybody I've spoken to I in the
[00:04:45] history of these memory competitions and
[00:04:48] stuff that I go to kind of would say the
[00:04:50] same thing but I gotta say like it's
[00:04:54] pretty convincing that he has something
[00:04:56] going on granted there's a lot of
[00:04:58] memorization going on he was saying he
[00:05:00] memorized all the two-digit numbers
[00:05:02] squared cubed to the fourth to the fifth
[00:05:06] all the way up to the 12th power which
[00:05:08] is insane that's thousands of digits I
[00:05:11] think he said he'd memorized 300,000
[00:05:12] digits in total there but anything
[00:05:15] higher than that he's clearly doing some
[00:05:17] calculation it just shows like he said
[00:05:20] the interesting part is is the the mind
[00:05:22] the capabilities of the mind she's nuts
[00:05:26] all right look at this guy freaking
[00:05:31] can't believe I'm holding my book I drew
[00:05:33] this whole thing it took me like six
[00:05:34] months now it's an actual book look I
[00:05:39] should do story time right now I forgot
[00:05:42] something but I can't remember what it
[00:05:43] was he's an elephant and he forgot
[00:05:47] something all right so I got to find a
[00:05:49] way to ship 17 boxes 300 and about 40 or
[00:05:55] 50 of these guys to three hundred and
[00:05:58] forty or fifty different addresses
[00:06:01] quickly and timely gonna wrap each one
[00:06:06] but that's kind of a anyhow shoot this
[00:06:10] way also got these from the air post
[00:06:13] office not the airport but you got to
[00:06:15] pay for this so what I was going to do
[00:06:16] kind of undo them flip them inside out
[00:06:19] then I have a free kind of package and
[00:06:22] take it in senate media mill oh yeah i
[00:06:25] also got assigned each one
[00:07:11] what
[00:07:13] Oh


=== TWIN BIRTHDAY PARADOX?? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W5E4HLLMzs

[00:00:01] that's me sorry Snoopy you can't go with
[00:00:07] us dogs aren't allowed on the school bus
[00:00:11] woof
[00:00:32] yo so big project of doing a vlog
[00:00:56] doing a vlog what's the reason why who
[00:00:59] cares I'm a memory champ all about
[00:01:01] memories all about making life memorable
[00:01:03] I have 30 days left in New York City i'm
[00:01:07] in new york city and i need to do as
[00:01:10] much as I can before I leave don't want
[00:01:12] the whole year suddenly 30 days left
[00:01:16] makes me feel like I haven't done
[00:01:18] anything gonna try and do as much as I
[00:01:19] can got a bucket list wrote a bunch of
[00:01:21] stuff on my chalkboard hopefully this
[00:01:24] will encourage me to just go out do
[00:01:27] every day you guys can follow along
[00:01:28] interesting or not I don't know I'm
[00:01:31] gonna try and we'll see what happens
[00:01:42] this is my plant calm Hamilton I grew up
[00:01:47] from an avocado seed he's huge
[00:02:02] so today is my 32nd birthday and I'm
[00:02:07] actually 30 years old it's a very fourth
[00:02:13] no big deal 32 is not a big deal but the
[00:02:16] cool thing is my girlfriend my roommate
[00:02:19] her birth is on the fourth today as well
[00:02:22] so one of my favorite things so
[00:02:24] everywhere we go obviously people are
[00:02:26] like you guys have the same birthday
[00:02:28] holy that's crazy right where did
[00:02:30] the odds that was crazy to me but the
[00:02:33] thing is there's a really cool
[00:02:34] mathematical explanation to how frequent
[00:02:37] and unspecial it actually is for people
[00:02:40] in groups to actually have shared
[00:02:42] birthdays within that group one of the
[00:02:44] best examples is one of the best
[00:02:48] examples is the world cup kind of
[00:02:51] paradox not paradox but there's a
[00:02:53] interesting case and the specifics are I
[00:02:57] don't think the last World Cup but
[00:02:58] previous I think that lasts seven World
[00:03:00] Cups before that the two final teams
[00:03:02] that met on the pitch in the finals I
[00:03:05] will have had at least one I think at
[00:03:08] least 12 players were on the pitch at
[00:03:12] the same time with the same birthday
[00:03:14] what are the odds of that so actually
[00:03:18] the way it works is in a group of say
[00:03:21] about 23 people take that number 23
[00:03:24] people in a room you have just over
[00:03:26] fifty percent chance that two people in
[00:03:28] that group have a birthday sounds like a
[00:03:31] lot right like a 50-50 chance increase
[00:03:34] that number say up to like 75 people
[00:03:36] then you have about a ninety nine
[00:03:38] percent chance crazy so the way it works
[00:03:41] is well humans are selfish so the idea
[00:03:45] is that if you have a roomful with 23
[00:03:48] people what you're doing is you're
[00:03:49] thinking of your birthday compared to 22
[00:03:53] other people right doesn't sound like a
[00:03:55] lot of comparisons right most likely
[00:03:57] someone won't have your birthday in
[00:04:00] common but think of all the other
[00:04:03] combinations in between right you're
[00:04:06] looking at another 231 combinations with
[00:04:09] in the room so amongst those
[00:04:12] chances are higher that you're going to
[00:04:14] have the same birthday right but the
[00:04:17] math if we want to go into the math
[00:04:19] right let's go into the math let's take
[00:04:24] these 23 people right so first how many
[00:04:26] combinations are there take this a bit
[00:04:29] of old school math where you take 23 x
[00:04:31] 22 talking about pairs / to you got 253
[00:04:37] possible combinations now the chance of
[00:04:40] two people having the same birthday is
[00:04:42] 364 out of 365 right think of it like
[00:04:47] this if 364 days out of the year are
[00:04:52] okay right there's just the one that it
[00:04:54] can't be right otherwise they have the
[00:04:56] same one we're saying which don't have
[00:04:58] the same birthday if you take that
[00:05:00] fraction 364 / 365 and multiply it by
[00:05:04] itself however many combinations are I
[00:05:06] right 253 then you get about forty-nine
[00:05:10] percent and that was that they don't
[00:05:12] match so to get the probability that
[00:05:14] they do match you just take one or a
[00:05:17] hundred percent minus forty-nine percent
[00:05:20] and you'll get just a hair over fifty
[00:05:24] fifty percent chance the two people in a
[00:05:25] group of 23 people will have the same
[00:05:28] birthday got it good
[00:05:40] blah blah
[00:05:54] in other news i got all of my books look
[00:06:04] at these this is just a few of the boxes
[00:06:06] of like 10 more boxes outside look at
[00:06:10] this guy I forgot something I forgot
[00:06:16] something i drew you I made you look who
[00:06:24] it is of his birthday is my hair get
[00:06:39] really not know this guy tells are nice
[00:06:45] did you put the flowers make cookies
[00:06:52] again specialist my heart is already 12
[00:06:56] of them hey Jonah one morning I didn't
[00:07:01] expect as hard as they were they were
[00:07:05] hard we are in this pizza
[00:07:09] hey i doing
[00:07:29] need a car running late her own birthday
[00:07:32] the hair friends are smarter drinking
[00:07:36] just like dr.
[00:07:49] time


=== Nelson Dellis' MIND SHOW - Alex Mullen // 2015 World Memory Champion ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2P1JnSbTGs

[00:00:36] hello everyone this is Nelson Dellis
[00:00:38] four time USA memory champion we are
[00:00:41] interviewing Alex fallen the new world
[00:00:43] memory champion thank you for joining me
[00:00:47] on this call for this interview how you
[00:00:49] doing I'm great how are you I'm very
[00:00:52] good where are you right now I am in
[00:00:55] Jackson Mississippi in my house just
[00:00:58] right off the Mexico campus all right so
[00:01:01] you're starting school back up for the
[00:01:02] semester after your winter break yeah
[00:01:05] yeah we had I started this past Monday
[00:01:08] Judy Joo Disney oh yeah nice so those of
[00:01:12] you who don't know Alex he just became
[00:01:15] the first American to win the World
[00:01:17] Championship in memory in China which
[00:01:20] was last December a few weeks ago and he
[00:01:24] wanted in some pretty impressive fashion
[00:01:26] scoring some crazy scores setting some
[00:01:29] world records and we just wanted to
[00:01:31] catch up with him today and kind of see
[00:01:33] how that was the experience and maybe
[00:01:36] learn a little more about your
[00:01:37] techniques and things like that
[00:01:39] so first I guess you know
[00:01:41] congratulations
[00:01:43] Thanks well you know I'd love to know I
[00:01:47] think we talked a lot while I was there
[00:01:48] but for people who don't know what what
[00:01:50] was it like going into that I mean I
[00:01:52] know you knew you were at a level where
[00:01:55] you could win based on the scores you
[00:01:57] had practiced right but did you ever
[00:01:59] think that you end up winning no not
[00:02:04] really
[00:02:04] I mean so okay so right before I left I
[00:02:08] was sort of just worried about finishing
[00:02:11] my exams because I just I had to like
[00:02:13] cram for exams into like two days like
[00:02:16] literally right before I left it was
[00:02:19] just like a huge nightmare so yeah once
[00:02:20] that was over I was just like totally
[00:02:22] relieved
[00:02:22] I wasn't even like worried about the
[00:02:24] competition at all but yeah I mean so I
[00:02:28] like you said I knew I knew what my
[00:02:31] personal best were I knew that if I you
[00:02:34] know was it able to hit you know
[00:02:37] something close to those in every event
[00:02:39] that I would
[00:02:40] chance but I didn't I didn't think that
[00:02:42] I would do that for obvious reasons just
[00:02:47] because you know you know it's not like
[00:02:49] every competition that I've had has been
[00:02:50] great I've had plenty of events where
[00:02:53] I'm just rapidly shyness competition you
[00:02:55] got to expect that right so I was
[00:02:58] expecting you know you know at least
[00:03:01] like a 20% reduction probably in most
[00:03:03] events maybe one or two just like
[00:03:05] totally screwed up events so just I mean
[00:03:08] thinking about that I what I was sore
[00:03:10] just hoping for like you know maybe
[00:03:12] best-case scenario I could get kind of
[00:03:15] squeak into the third yeah and maybe he
[00:03:17] gets to get some extra prize money yes
[00:03:21] so he in my mind that was kind of like
[00:03:22] the best-case scenario for me yeah
[00:03:24] that's cool yeah I mean it's so yeah you
[00:03:27] ended up having I think pretty much I
[00:03:31] mean I know you could have done better
[00:03:33] in terms of what you probably scored in
[00:03:35] practice but in terms of competition
[00:03:36] level like yeah I mean everything pretty
[00:03:40] much I I did I did about as good as I
[00:03:44] could have hope to do in pretty much
[00:03:46] every event yeah I they were okay so in
[00:03:50] three of the events I actually broke my
[00:03:52] personal best
[00:03:53] even that I've never done in training
[00:03:54] that's crazy which yeah which is crazy
[00:03:56] like I you know I never would expect to
[00:03:58] do that those those were binary which is
[00:04:01] binary was just like like a hair
[00:04:02] abstract I we were so I did a 505 Bret
[00:04:08] believe it or not my best before that
[00:04:10] was 455 so I I agree stood 50 points
[00:04:14] which is what's crazy you know that yeah
[00:04:17] there's no way I could have even hoped
[00:04:20] for that and then and then words words I
[00:04:26] also my best before that was actually
[00:04:28] 220 okay and I mean I guess that's less
[00:04:32] less cool just because the amendment
[00:04:34] camp boards are generally much harder
[00:04:36] yeah the words championship were a lot
[00:04:38] you're right horrible so long yeah and
[00:04:43] then I guess there were two events so I
[00:04:45] mean names I didn't do quite you know
[00:04:48] quite as well it's like
[00:04:49] probably could have but you know that
[00:04:51] was obviously affected by the whole like
[00:04:54] 15-minute at between memorization and
[00:04:56] recall and I was I was sort of hoping to
[00:04:59] do better in speed numbers so I never
[00:05:02] 400 my best in that is like 537 and I
[00:05:06] was kind of hoping I could get something
[00:05:08] around 500 but yeah you know so that
[00:05:11] when I was a little weaker but you know
[00:05:12] at that point I was I already didn't
[00:05:14] better than I expected in so many events
[00:05:15] that I yeah well let's let's talk up
[00:05:19] talk about for a second year your your
[00:05:21] records they're your records there what
[00:05:23] did you do so you did our numbers and
[00:05:26] yes 3029 that's right yeah yeah so I
[00:05:32] mean are you happy with that I mean
[00:05:33] you're the first person ever break the
[00:05:35] 3000 degree yeah which is yeah I was
[00:05:38] thrilled with that I mean my best my
[00:05:41] best before my best see in practice was
[00:05:43] around 3200 yeah but i but i didn't i
[00:05:47] didn't read as many as I kind of had
[00:05:49] hoped to or that I did in that run I
[00:05:52] didn't code as many so you know honestly
[00:05:54] I had well I was in the recall I I like
[00:05:57] tried to calculate I was like okay I'm
[00:05:59] not sure about this one in this one this
[00:06:00] one and I calculated the odds okay worst
[00:06:02] case scenario I got like a 2600 okay or
[00:06:06] something if you're like 26 of 2,700
[00:06:07] like it's always everything you thought
[00:06:09] maybe it was wrong wrong yeah yeah yeah
[00:06:13] it's always a sort of a based on that I
[00:06:15] was kind of expecting to get like a 28
[00:06:18] or 29 hundred so when I what I got about
[00:06:22] three dasu yeah that's awesome
[00:06:24] yeah they announced the first score
[00:06:26] third and I was like 28 something I was
[00:06:29] like yeah but yeah we've been but then I
[00:06:37] need but then I knew also they did it my
[00:06:41] last I had put nine just at the very
[00:06:43] last line and so when he said 2029 I was
[00:06:47] like oh yes that's amazing that was a
[00:06:52] great feeling and yeah yeah just to give
[00:06:55] people some perspective I remember when
[00:06:57] I started this memory stuff I listened
[00:07:00] to
[00:07:00] O'Brien audiotape and it was all about
[00:07:03] like you could memorize a thousand
[00:07:05] digits in an hour and I remember back
[00:07:07] then I was like holy
[00:07:09] a thousand digits and even learning how
[00:07:11] to do that and eventually being able to
[00:07:13] do more than that just a little bit more
[00:07:15] in competition and that gives you the
[00:07:17] Grand Master status if you can do that
[00:07:19] amongst other things you know that was a
[00:07:21] pretty basic benchmark to being a good
[00:07:25] memory competitor but then 2000 came
[00:07:28] along and that was kind of like yeah I
[00:07:30] think new mm you're pretty solid but
[00:07:33] yeah I mean now you it up for all
[00:07:34] of us it's like the 3000 that's amazing
[00:07:39] thanks yeah I you know definitely going
[00:07:43] in when I when I first started out I
[00:07:45] would never have thought that I could do
[00:07:46] 2,000 right oh yeah and yeah I mean it's
[00:07:50] just kind of yeah it's take it's taking
[00:07:53] a while but yeah so you know I we've
[00:07:57] talked about this a lot but I'm sure a
[00:07:59] lot of people are very interested how
[00:08:00] you do that
[00:08:01] so if you're right if you don't mind
[00:08:03] telling me again but imagine you're
[00:08:05] telling everybody else um sure what
[00:08:07] system do you use and for say for our
[00:08:10] numbers what was your strategy right for
[00:08:15] something for my for my number system
[00:08:18] it's pretty pretty straightforward it's
[00:08:19] just a 1,000 image three digit system
[00:08:23] one image for every three digits and I
[00:08:27] just did it based on the major system
[00:08:28] okay so every you know they're like you
[00:08:31] know a few exceptions but pretty much
[00:08:32] all of it is just like straight you kind
[00:08:34] of by-the-book major system so you get
[00:08:37] words out of the three digits they're
[00:08:39] all consonants and vowels
[00:08:41] yeah I gotta collect 3 3 5 7 is just
[00:08:44] like milk visits MLK that kind of thing
[00:08:49] I usually so my system is about about a
[00:08:52] third people and two thirds objects
[00:08:56] something like that I mean then what I
[00:08:59] do is I just put two of those images on
[00:09:02] each location so six digits per location
[00:09:06] just kind of use the regular memory
[00:09:09] palace strategy
[00:09:10] like every other event yeah I meant for
[00:09:14] the our numbers I so i basically I
[00:09:18] practiced I did the our numbers like
[00:09:20] three times before the competition and I
[00:09:25] didn't but I but I had been practicing
[00:09:27] the 15-minute event a lie right and I
[00:09:30] like that have been on and so I what I
[00:09:32] tried to do just like kind of my idea I
[00:09:34] really didn't know what many people did
[00:09:37] because it's kind of hard to find unless
[00:09:39] you ask them right people aren't really
[00:09:41] giving out there our strategies for
[00:09:43] different yeah like how you what he's
[00:09:45] talking about is this the time you spend
[00:09:47] memorizing verse reviewing and how far
[00:09:50] you go from a review and how often you
[00:09:52] review because that's important right
[00:09:53] for an hour you need to review at some
[00:09:55] point right anxious right so for
[00:09:59] basically all the events you know that I
[00:10:01] had done previously it was pretty easy I
[00:10:04] could just say okay I'm just gonna
[00:10:05] memorize it and review it once or maybe
[00:10:08] review twice and that would be it just
[00:10:10] because they're all shorter events and
[00:10:12] then when this came up I sort of thought
[00:10:14] to myself okay you know I like the 15
[00:10:16] minute event maybe I can sort of just
[00:10:17] try to do a couple different 15 minutes
[00:10:20] events in a row okay and so that's
[00:10:23] that's exactly what I did I just I what
[00:10:26] I basically do is when I needed to be
[00:10:28] him in an event I just read it once and
[00:10:30] then I review it once and that's it and
[00:10:34] so I would take each I basically do
[00:10:37] three fifteen minute chunks I read and
[00:10:40] it it's it's sort of that but it's more
[00:10:43] like I take them and basically each page
[00:10:46] so each page is a think of thousand yeah
[00:10:49] yeah and so I just do one page and then
[00:10:53] review the that same page and so it's
[00:10:56] that usually takes me a little less than
[00:10:58] fifteen minutes but it's something you
[00:11:00] know it's kind of on at the same time
[00:11:02] scale and then so I'll do that page
[00:11:05] review it do the second page review that
[00:11:07] do the third page review that and then
[00:11:11] then I'll review all of them again
[00:11:15] and then that kind of puts me somewhere
[00:11:18] after the 50 minute mark yeah and then
[00:11:22] and then from that point I just go to
[00:11:23] the fourth page and I just read as many
[00:11:25] as I can review that once and then
[00:11:28] that's it yeah so I sort of tried to do
[00:11:31] three 15-minute events and they sort of
[00:11:33] I'm in review all of them again and then
[00:11:35] a little bit at the end whatever change
[00:11:37] you have after that yeah exactly
[00:11:39] yeah so now I mean you know honestly I
[00:11:41] don't I don't know if that's the best
[00:11:42] way to do it that's kind of was my idea
[00:11:47] that's what that world record means yeah
[00:11:55] right but yeah so that's um that's what
[00:11:58] I do okay and then I wanted to ask you
[00:12:00] this just personally I remember during
[00:12:03] recall right after the one hour you get
[00:12:06] two hours to write down the numbers and
[00:12:08] you know most people flip over those
[00:12:10] papers and they're scribbling down to
[00:12:12] get the numbers out of their head on
[00:12:13] paper yeah that you and you were just
[00:12:16] like like this vampire for like 15-20
[00:12:21] minutes maybe even more I guess you were
[00:12:23] just like going over them before you
[00:12:24] wrote them down yeah right yeah so I
[00:12:26] actually I do net in every event except
[00:12:30] for worse okay which and there's not
[00:12:33] really a much primary reason to the
[00:12:35] words thing I just I don't know I just
[00:12:36] never have I got it's sort of a spell
[00:12:39] that just to get a spelling me wants us
[00:12:41] or something like that yeah but yeah so
[00:12:43] for every event except for except for
[00:12:46] names and dates obviously just because
[00:12:48] they don't have the locations to review
[00:12:52] all the other ones I try to review it
[00:12:54] once in my head before I go back because
[00:12:57] justjust I mean I just I just did that
[00:13:01] once and I was like oh this kind of
[00:13:03] works and then I literally just kept
[00:13:06] doing that yeah you know since since
[00:13:08] then so but it's true once once you
[00:13:11] remove the paper and you are able to do
[00:13:14] the whole thing in your head once using
[00:13:16] the memory palace it's pretty much there
[00:13:18] for I don't think there's like I'm very
[00:13:22] rarely am able to go through it all I
[00:13:24] mean when I'm writing it down I'll
[00:13:26] forget something right
[00:13:27] you know once you have it yeah and then
[00:13:29] so my logic was basically just okay I
[00:13:31] can definitely review it in my head
[00:13:32] faster than I can write it down so maybe
[00:13:35] for the sort of trouble spots I'll be
[00:13:38] able to kind of get to it in my head
[00:13:39] just in time before I would have
[00:13:41] forgotten it if I written it down you
[00:13:43] only mean that's actually very
[00:13:44] interesting because no you know you're
[00:13:49] focused on that particular point and
[00:13:51] then you get to a certain point and
[00:13:53] you're like oh shoot you have to think
[00:13:55] about it but if you do that right like
[00:13:57] you said it's faster and yeah through it
[00:14:00] it's pretty much cemented at that point
[00:14:03] interesting yeah yeah so I mean I you
[00:14:07] know that's that's been this is kind of
[00:14:08] a habit now I you know obviously there's
[00:14:11] kind of trade-offs because you could you
[00:14:13] know maybe some extra time at the end to
[00:14:14] just you know you know I kind of
[00:14:17] reviewed your system and maybe pick up
[00:14:18] some gaps that way yeah but you know I
[00:14:21] just I've been doing this and that's
[00:14:23] what I like to be able so yeah that's a
[00:14:25] big part of it right also is finding
[00:14:27] what you're comfortable with and just
[00:14:28] kind of doing that on repeat yeah yeah
[00:14:33] all right so what else I mean there was
[00:14:35] another record you broke but then that
[00:14:37] was also broken too with the cards yeah
[00:14:40] our cards so the record has been 28
[00:14:44] decks for many many years I've been
[00:14:47] pretty more and then this year what you
[00:14:50] and Ola three three of us broke it all
[00:14:54] and I both did 28 and 4 cards and then
[00:14:57] she had been at 31 31 we just yeah which
[00:15:01] just blows my mind because I know he
[00:15:03] uses a one card system someone will fire
[00:15:05] every image I mean I think Ola told me
[00:15:09] that so I'm pretty sure that's right
[00:15:10] yeah and yeah and then like honestly I
[00:15:15] think because he can do that it gets
[00:15:18] that's the obviously the most impressive
[00:15:19] record I think that was broken in my
[00:15:22] mind because that's you know just one
[00:15:24] image for every card is just yeah that's
[00:15:26] a lot that's crazy
[00:15:28] I mean 31 yeah anyway did you so how
[00:15:33] many decks did you try I
[00:15:38] right just thirty thirty and four cards
[00:15:41] okay so I guess I you know I guess I
[00:15:44] just two decks yeah okay and then I know
[00:15:47] a lot of people I mean the speed cards
[00:15:50] that you did the performance there was
[00:15:52] awesome I mean you ended up thanks you
[00:15:55] can mailed them both the first time what
[00:15:57] did you do twenty three twenty four uh
[00:15:59] yeah it was 24 seconds week 24 of nine
[00:16:03] and I've been changed
[00:16:04] perfect I also watched you during the
[00:16:06] recall I'm you were done before I even
[00:16:08] put mine together and I do fine very
[00:16:10] well yeah I I can I felt yeah I mean
[00:16:15] that definitely doesn't always happen I
[00:16:16] felt really luck to you because both
[00:16:18] times
[00:16:18] both times I went through in my head and
[00:16:21] I think I maybe had I either had zero
[00:16:24] blanks or one blank one missing image
[00:16:27] and that's that's like you know
[00:16:30] obviously the best-case scenario
[00:16:32] usually it's you can figure it usually
[00:16:34] it's a copy it's at least two or three
[00:16:35] and then you have to kind of play with
[00:16:37] the cars yeah but yeah I was able to
[00:16:39] just kind of finish them in like two and
[00:16:40] a half minutes and I was just like yes
[00:16:46] you know yeah and then the second time
[00:16:50] so you have to get even faster to make
[00:16:51] sure that you won the whole thing and
[00:16:54] that you did in 21 seconds and what 21.5
[00:16:59] just like putting on behind you right
[00:17:01] and that would get enough felt like the
[00:17:02] same thing right like you knew it and
[00:17:04] you put it together really yeah yeah
[00:17:06] like I said that does not always happen
[00:17:08] for me but yeah and it worked out so
[00:17:12] what's your strategy I know this I've
[00:17:13] asked you to death about it but um yeah
[00:17:16] your system is really interesting I know
[00:17:18] you share kind of a similar strategy to
[00:17:21] Lance you're on another American but why
[00:17:25] don't you tell us what it is sure I'll
[00:17:28] see if I can explain it but it's time
[00:17:29] just playing yeah it's really
[00:17:32] complicated I don't know if you put like
[00:17:34] a look Lance
[00:17:35] basically wrote this kind of long
[00:17:37] description of it iron art art of memory
[00:17:39] calm yeah I don't know if you can put
[00:17:43] like a layout of the link below
[00:17:44] scription or something but so heat yeah
[00:17:48] so he explains it really well better
[00:17:49] than I'm gonna explain it right now but
[00:17:51] this should but the gist of it is it's
[00:17:55] it's a two card system but it's sort of
[00:17:59] is half the size of like a normal full
[00:18:03] 2700 image systems like Ben's system for
[00:18:06] instance is 2700 images 2704 images
[00:18:09] every different in every pair has a
[00:18:12] unique image and mine is only thirteen
[00:18:15] hundred and fifty-six images so just
[00:18:17] have that yeah and so the thing is two
[00:18:22] different card pairs can have the same
[00:18:25] image and then so then that's of the way
[00:18:29] I just English you know how how do I
[00:18:31] know whether it is this pair with this
[00:18:32] pair if I see that image I used the
[00:18:35] locations and so it's sort of split into
[00:18:38] two blocks so one block is all suit
[00:18:43] combinations that are black first so
[00:18:45] like spades fade if the pair is you know
[00:18:47] club diamond and that's black first etc
[00:18:50] and the other side is all the red first
[00:18:52] version so for instance like Spade heart
[00:18:55] over here would be the same image as the
[00:18:58] same numbers with heart spades so it's
[00:19:02] it's you know it's a little more
[00:19:04] complicated but that's that's the basic
[00:19:06] idea and incident right and that's the
[00:19:09] way I distinguish between them is on the
[00:19:12] location if it's black first it's the
[00:19:14] black first version I continue to a stay
[00:19:17] on that location and I continue to link
[00:19:19] images there yeah just keeps racking up
[00:19:21] right right I mean I can give an example
[00:19:24] as probably the best way to do it and
[00:19:26] then if it's the red first version I
[00:19:29] make that the last image of that
[00:19:31] location and I stop and I move to the
[00:19:34] next more data so if I get like if I get
[00:19:36] a black first I'll put the image there
[00:19:38] another black first put the image there
[00:19:40] a red first I put the image there stop
[00:19:43] move to the second location if it's a
[00:19:45] red first that's the only image there
[00:19:48] okay so the race it's kind of the images
[00:19:51] are variable in the location sometimes
[00:19:53] you may have yeah exactly
[00:19:56] usually it's just one or two sometimes
[00:19:58] three sometimes four in power cards of n
[00:20:01] this is actually kind of unusual I had
[00:20:04] maybe like four or five that were just
[00:20:06] like really long chains like six images
[00:20:08] Wow and I so what I usually do for cases
[00:20:11] like that is I just I'll just stop like
[00:20:14] if I feel like it's getting to be too
[00:20:16] many I just stop it move to the next one
[00:20:17] even though it was still black first and
[00:20:19] I just kind of make a mental note it
[00:20:22] died you know made that change and then
[00:20:25] so I think that happened to me in the
[00:20:26] how are cards a bit that happens to me
[00:20:27] four or five times which is which is a
[00:20:30] lot but I think you know luckily with
[00:20:34] with enough reviews I was oh yeah so in
[00:20:40] that case do you do I mean you said you
[00:20:44] you felt like it was getting too long
[00:20:46] but do you have like a cutoff like is it
[00:20:48] three images or images where you'll
[00:20:50] never go down there it's just kind of a
[00:20:52] feeling
[00:20:53] so sometimes we may feel up to doing
[00:20:55] like five in a row if that happens yeah
[00:20:57] yeah I can yeah so sometimes five
[00:21:00] sometimes four sometimes six actually oh
[00:21:08] yeah I was gonna say actually so this
[00:21:11] kind of this problem is you know it
[00:21:14] happens more often the our events but it
[00:21:16] worries me a lot more in the speed guard
[00:21:18] yeah if I'm going right fast absolutely
[00:21:21] I have like six images I'm just like but
[00:21:23] you know that's not good because because
[00:21:25] especially because you know I'm not able
[00:21:28] to really tell what the order is inside
[00:21:31] the location yeah I mean yeah just like
[00:21:35] with you know just like with numbers you
[00:21:36] know you can make swapping changes
[00:21:38] generally is it's not as big a deal for
[00:21:45] like things that are three or four
[00:21:47] because it kind of becomes a story and
[00:21:48] you can get the directionality of it but
[00:21:51] but yeah for speed cards especially if
[00:21:53] you're trying go really fast sometimes
[00:21:54] that story is kind of jumbled now
[00:21:56] they're not very good yeah so I was
[00:21:59] really just kind of like
[00:22:01] I've basically going into this week cars
[00:22:02] I had two fears and and two things that
[00:22:07] I was really just trying to like focus
[00:22:09] on like I was just saying to myself like
[00:22:10] right as I started so one of them was if
[00:22:13] I get too many too many ones I'm just
[00:22:15] gonna go to the next one because it's
[00:22:16] really easy to remember it was just one
[00:22:18] deck right you just do it once is ranbir
[00:22:19] it yeah it's always all right I mean it
[00:22:22] then there really happens I'm kind of
[00:22:23] making the system sound worse than it is
[00:22:25] but but on the second on the second
[00:22:28] speed part trial
[00:22:29] unlike the you know fifth or sixth
[00:22:30] location I had four that were all black
[00:22:34] and I was like I'm basically just like
[00:22:36] freaked out nothing and then and so I
[00:22:39] just went to the next one even though it
[00:22:40] was only four which is really that many
[00:22:42] but I just moved yeah yeah so this is
[00:22:47] kind of an example of that yeah yeah
[00:22:52] sure right so uh okay so I would just
[00:22:57] start in the first location so this so
[00:23:00] this for me so it's red first right so
[00:23:02] this is like one of those like big wind
[00:23:05] turbine windmill things like kind of
[00:23:09] those like sleek ones that you see like
[00:23:11] in the fields this is a giant right
[00:23:15] right so I just take that I put that on
[00:23:18] the first location say it's like a
[00:23:20] little plant there I just feel like
[00:23:22] spinning an air right because it's a red
[00:23:26] car so that's done this next one is Andy
[00:23:30] Dwyer from Parks and Recreation now you
[00:23:33] go okay so yeah but the camera place
[00:23:38] over there was yeah so I replacing there
[00:23:40] it's also right first so he might be
[00:23:42] just like staring into the cameras and
[00:23:43] like that so a lot of red first
[00:23:47] obviously this one is a love potion so I
[00:23:50] would just go to the you know the next
[00:23:51] location put the love potion there and
[00:23:54] these are all red so it would all be
[00:23:56] like wine because it here's one this is
[00:23:57] a stage and then so the next one would
[00:24:01] be a movie camera and so I just have the
[00:24:06] stage there and maybe like to see the
[00:24:07] movie camera coming down like filming
[00:24:08] the stage and that we got it for that
[00:24:12] low gets moved to the next one
[00:24:13] etc that's cool it's not it sounds like
[00:24:16] you know pretty complicated and you know
[00:24:20] I when I first started it I wasn't like
[00:24:22] I sort of wasn't comfortable with it and
[00:24:25] I was like this isn't gonna work but but
[00:24:29] it just you know I get it just gets
[00:24:31] easier with practice and now I'm pretty
[00:24:32] you know it feels very natural I mean
[00:24:35] isn't any reason I sort of forced myself
[00:24:37] to do it was because I knew today well I
[00:24:39] kind of knew that I wanted to take it to
[00:24:41] card system I was like okay if I can get
[00:24:43] this to work it'll be much easier
[00:24:45] because I didn't you know I didn't want
[00:24:47] to have too many images outside of my
[00:24:48] number system because you know if you
[00:24:50] used to 2,700 that's like 70 hundred
[00:24:53] images is just for cards right
[00:24:55] reviewing them it's hard to yeah which
[00:25:00] is which I didn't which I didn't like
[00:25:01] and then and then I knew that so this
[00:25:05] this system is I definitely stole it
[00:25:08] solely from sort of two people Johanna
[00:25:11] smell is kind of the first person who
[00:25:13] did this work yeah pop like pop I guess
[00:25:16] pioneered that strategy of jumping the
[00:25:18] locations if it's read first or black
[00:25:20] first yeah so I stole that from him and
[00:25:24] then and I knew that he I asked him I
[00:25:27] asked him what his best times were and I
[00:25:29] knew what some of them were from
[00:25:30] competition and so I was like okay
[00:25:32] clearly he's fast of this right so you
[00:25:35] know the potential for getting fast is
[00:25:37] there and so that was that was what you
[00:25:40] know pushed me over the engine to
[00:25:41] finally actually doing it and then the
[00:25:45] other kind of stealing part is just from
[00:25:46] Lance like I said he read a big article
[00:25:49] I just read that article and that's how
[00:25:51] I did it and so he came up it's sort of
[00:25:55] based it's mainly based on the major
[00:25:57] system but he has all these kind of
[00:25:58] phonetic nuances for like the face cars
[00:26:01] and things yeah and so I took most of
[00:26:05] those from him got it and that's that's
[00:26:08] how it happened
[00:26:09] that's cool I loved one thing that you
[00:26:12] told me which you know if somebody's
[00:26:14] interested out there to do the to do to
[00:26:16] card system is that you feel you told me
[00:26:20] this that it's yeah like you're cheating
[00:26:22] right like it's so
[00:26:24] easy you're the most humble guy in the
[00:26:26] world so when you say that I really
[00:26:29] believe you it's not like you're just
[00:26:30] saying oh it's easier but I get it yeah
[00:26:32] you make it sound you don't have that
[00:26:34] many images you you know them very
[00:26:36] quickly and it's there's something about
[00:26:38] that you know just having a thousand
[00:26:41] three hundred images and being able to
[00:26:43] drop them as you go even though they're
[00:26:46] variable sizes yeah that's yeah I mean
[00:26:50] yeah I got mercury I think what I said
[00:26:53] was it just like when I used to use pio
[00:26:56] and I just do one car you know like a
[00:26:58] lot of people one card from her image
[00:27:01] and I yeah I really felt like when I was
[00:27:05] doing you know like you know 38 39
[00:27:08] second decks
[00:27:09] I really felt like I was moving faster
[00:27:12] and having to like think faster with the
[00:27:15] PA oh right with the PA oh right and
[00:27:18] it's oh it feels like in my mind it
[00:27:20] feels more impressive to do like a 36
[00:27:23] with a PA oh then like a 25 with the
[00:27:26] system that I use now right which I
[00:27:30] which I realized sounds weird good but
[00:27:33] it's yeah there's kind of what like my
[00:27:35] impression is yeah yeah nice well so
[00:27:39] what what's next man what's your the the
[00:27:42] best in the world you are don't I mean
[00:27:48] you are that's well that's what that
[00:27:50] title gives you based on yeah right
[00:27:53] what's what's happening in 2016 what are
[00:27:59] your plans now that you've gotten that
[00:28:01] um I mean okay so I my life right now is
[00:28:08] basically just two things it's being a
[00:28:10] med school and then also doing this
[00:28:11] memory stuff right as it has been for
[00:28:14] basically the last year and a half but
[00:28:17] you know definitely I was going to do
[00:28:19] this anyway but but being but winning
[00:28:23] the tournament obviously helps I was
[00:28:27] trying to get you know trying to get
[00:28:28] more into kind of coaching and teaching
[00:28:30] maybe doing some talks
[00:28:33] at different maybe other med schools and
[00:28:36] so that that's kind of where I'd like to
[00:28:39] go in terms of memory I still want to do
[00:28:40] a little bit of training for the
[00:28:41] competitions but yeah I'm trying to get
[00:28:44] more yeah just to taste kind of speaking
[00:28:50] engagements stuff like that to try to
[00:28:52] just spread the techniques and focusing
[00:28:57] on learning strategies so you know
[00:29:01] obviously I love competing and stuff
[00:29:03] like that but yeah I want to try to you
[00:29:06] know through these talks and coaching
[00:29:08] and stuff kind of spread the use of
[00:29:11] memory palaces and mnemonics for for
[00:29:14] learning and classes and things like
[00:29:16] that yeah and then so in that for med
[00:29:20] school it's kind of a nasty time because
[00:29:24] I we had basically at the end of the
[00:29:27] most med schools at the end of your
[00:29:28] second year you take this big exam like
[00:29:30] this big national exam stupid called the
[00:29:34] step 1 exam which is just like you're
[00:29:36] you know it's got all the stuff from the
[00:29:39] first two years and it kind of decides
[00:29:41] which specialties are gonna be available
[00:29:44] to you and you know determines a lot of
[00:29:47] your or you know panels for appeal for
[00:29:54] different residency programs how well
[00:29:56] you know what the how strong the
[00:29:58] residency program you can get so it's a
[00:30:00] pretty big deal you know it's sort of
[00:30:03] like the acte or the m10 or whatever the
[00:30:05] SAT but actually even more of a big deal
[00:30:08] in terms of this you know its track so
[00:30:15] yeah I saw those coming out so so that's
[00:30:17] coming up in basically the summer it's
[00:30:21] going to be right after the xmt okay so
[00:30:23] thanks sorry that's okay
[00:30:27] yeah so so that's kind of um that's
[00:30:31] obviously like a huge kind of thing for
[00:30:33] me right now is just studying for that
[00:30:35] so I'm gonna you know I'm gonna try to
[00:30:36] get as much memory something as I can
[00:30:38] while while doing that
[00:30:42] I know but a bunch of my viewers are our
[00:30:45] students themselves so you know you have
[00:30:48] a unique thing that you're a student
[00:30:50] still but also a med student which you
[00:30:54] have to learn a lot of stuff right oh
[00:30:56] yeah yeah I mean it's it definitely it's
[00:31:00] a good thing to be memories editor
[00:31:02] Indian mystical ah yeah yeah so yeah
[00:31:04] there's a lot of memorization in a lot
[00:31:06] of yeah well if you have to give some
[00:31:09] tips for students who will have to
[00:31:11] memorize a lot of stuff maybe even
[00:31:13] specifically med students what do you
[00:31:15] typically tell them
[00:31:17] do you always necessarily tell them to
[00:31:20] build memory palaces to store everything
[00:31:22] is that always the answer
[00:31:23] um you know that's I I sort of I want I
[00:31:31] don't always tell them they have to but
[00:31:33] that's what I want to tell them yeah I
[00:31:36] mean that's basically what I do what I
[00:31:38] mean for the most part and it's
[00:31:39] something that's kind of new I always
[00:31:43] just you know have a memory palace that
[00:31:45] I put any images there as I'm learning
[00:31:47] okay or not not like right as I'm
[00:31:50] learning it I usually try to get the you
[00:31:52] know the concept down first and then try
[00:31:55] to put the details into the into a
[00:31:57] palace just cuz I you know it's I find
[00:32:04] that it's like you know it's relatively
[00:32:06] easy for me to do now if it doesn't have
[00:32:09] had a whole lot of extra time and it
[00:32:10] makes a pretty big difference in terms
[00:32:11] of being able to recall it a really
[00:32:15] important for me thing for me that also
[00:32:16] is a good review schedule so so I use it
[00:32:22] I use this spaced repetition software
[00:32:24] called Anki yeah that's a great software
[00:32:28] right so you know that's a lot of people
[00:32:32] try it and they're you know they don't
[00:32:34] like it very much but that's what I used
[00:32:36] and I really like it because you know it
[00:32:40] just it automata is the reviews you have
[00:32:42] to do see one or two think about it you
[00:32:44] know you just wake up in the morning and
[00:32:46] this is what you have to review for that
[00:32:47] day you know and supposedly it's
[00:32:49] supposed to be optimized for
[00:32:52] you know it's the minimum amount of
[00:32:54] reviews you can do while still hopefully
[00:32:56] retaining information so I really like
[00:33:00] using that so yep super review is
[00:33:02] important you know I definitely try to
[00:33:04] emphasize memory analysis and just just
[00:33:07] visual visual mnemonics in general yeah
[00:33:11] even if it's just making images and just
[00:33:15] kind of having them float around in
[00:33:16] space or just having them be in one
[00:33:19] place yeah with the memory palace with
[00:33:24] the memory palaces you know you're
[00:33:26] learning a lot of stuff so how do you
[00:33:29] are you always creating new memory
[00:33:32] palaces for new information are you
[00:33:34] using old ones do you create new ones on
[00:33:37] the fly how does it work
[00:33:38] yeah that's a good question um I
[00:33:40] basically the way I do it now is I
[00:33:43] create them as I go okay which which was
[00:33:47] for me and we used like a huge turning
[00:33:50] point to being to being able to use them
[00:33:53] because when I basically I you know I I
[00:33:56] had been competing for it you know maybe
[00:33:58] like six not competing my practice
[00:34:00] training for like six months maybe
[00:34:02] before I even started to use them and I
[00:34:04] tried to I tried it like one class or a
[00:34:07] couple classes and I was just like this
[00:34:10] is such a pain like you know it like I
[00:34:14] got to make new ones all the time and
[00:34:16] it's just I just didn't like it I don't
[00:34:19] know and so I kind of I kind of stopped
[00:34:21] doing it for a while and then basically
[00:34:24] what I sort of realized it in med school
[00:34:26] that was that was in college this is
[00:34:31] what I do now which is just I pick a
[00:34:33] location sort of to start out I just say
[00:34:35] you know I'm gonna use my high school
[00:34:37] for let's say the gastrointestinal tract
[00:34:40] section that we're doing right now and I
[00:34:44] just start just start somewhere and then
[00:34:48] I just make you know may I just choose
[00:34:50] locations as I go you know so it
[00:34:53] literally the only kind of extra time in
[00:34:55] my mind is picking the location because
[00:34:58] once I have it I just start game and
[00:34:59] just start in the intersection where the
[00:35:01] cards come in and then I'm gonna and I
[00:35:03] pick I don't go there I don't do
[00:35:05] anything ahead of time I just used what
[00:35:08] I already have we'll come up with my
[00:35:10] bags you're right yeah exactly that was
[00:35:13] so like I said that's kind of a big
[00:35:14] turning point for me because it it made
[00:35:16] the whole process of using memory
[00:35:17] palaces very effortless and I and I do
[00:35:22] think that they're a big help just for
[00:35:24] in terms of being in terms of being an
[00:35:26] extra hook for your images in terms of
[00:35:29] organizing the material and kind of
[00:35:32] keeping it in a nice sort of linear
[00:35:33] fashion and being able to group things
[00:35:35] together yeah so yeah yeah also one
[00:35:55] thing that kind of bothered me is I
[00:35:56] would always want to put like new stuff
[00:35:58] in if I wanted to learn it there like
[00:36:01] for instance if I made something and I
[00:36:03] wanted to add something else into it
[00:36:04] later right yeah like the way I usually
[00:36:06] make libertas competitions is all go
[00:36:09] room by room and I'll say okay I'm gonna
[00:36:10] have five in this five in every room or
[00:36:12] ten and you know yeah and that was like
[00:36:15] ended up being very rigid it so this way
[00:36:18] I don't really organize it by room and I
[00:36:20] don't know how many are any true yeah
[00:36:21] but I can sort of just add them wherever
[00:36:24] I want to do it it's not a problem that
[00:36:26] makes sense yeah that's super useful
[00:36:27] yeah cuz yeah you may have one piece of
[00:36:30] information and then you keep memorizing
[00:36:33] but then you realize you're gonna add
[00:36:34] some other fact or yeah it's just like
[00:36:36] to Bridget to me yeah that's okay I like
[00:36:40] that
[00:36:41] you know I'm it makes me it makes me
[00:36:45] really glad to say that I can actually
[00:36:47] use this because I really felt like I
[00:36:49] just failed so hard using it the first
[00:36:51] time and just like quit you know yeah
[00:36:54] and then yeah so it's nice to be able to
[00:36:57] yeah that's great to hear I mean I'm out
[00:37:00] of school so I never really got you know
[00:37:02] the chance to use it unfortunately I
[00:37:05] only learned memory techniques
[00:37:06] afterwards but yeah I wish I had known I
[00:37:11] did
[00:37:11] yeah but it's I get that question a lot
[00:37:13] is like are these really effective for
[00:37:16] stuff like what you're studying and
[00:37:17] you're showing that it is which is
[00:37:19] really encouraging to hear that's cool
[00:37:22] yeah I mean yeah I mean it just looked
[00:37:36] like I said I just come in it was a
[00:37:38] really bad feeling to be like you know
[00:37:41] to think of myself as like a strong
[00:37:42] memory competitor and then be like okay
[00:37:46] well I'm not even able to do the right
[00:37:47] so how am I gonna convince anyone to do
[00:37:50] this like I no one's good
[00:37:52] I mean there's there's death like and
[00:37:53] you know you in my experience there's
[00:37:54] definitely like a dis learning curve to
[00:37:56] getting it to get it comfortable with it
[00:37:58] to being able to use it effectively but
[00:38:00] I think with you know with the right
[00:38:01] kind of tricks kind of you know
[00:38:03] hopefully some of the things that I
[00:38:05] mentioned you're saying yeah it makes it
[00:38:08] more palatable for the everyday person
[00:38:10] right cool
[00:38:11] well thank you for taking some time to
[00:38:14] speak with me I'm Jenna and I've been

=== Nelson Dellis' MIND SHOW - Luis Angel // Superhuman Champ ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Diyos-yctXc

[00:00:09] hello Luis angel how are you doing this
[00:00:12] is one of my first interviews with a
[00:00:15] fellow memory competitor you're my first
[00:00:17] how you doing a great man very young
[00:00:20] yeah we've known each other for a while
[00:00:24] now and we could say that this week or
[00:00:28] like us last week was probably the
[00:00:31] biggest one of your life yeah yeah yeah
[00:00:38] before that but it was kind of like a
[00:00:41] dream up to that point and yes last one
[00:00:43] is definitely like it just came to
[00:00:46] fruition in reality yeah so for those
[00:00:48] who don't know Luis angel is memory
[00:00:51] competitor of many years he's competed
[00:00:54] in many competitions and he's an avid
[00:00:57] speaker teacher do-gooder in anxiety and
[00:01:03] he was blessed with an awesome
[00:01:05] opportunity on a show called superhuman
[00:01:07] and aired on Fox just last week and what
[00:01:11] happened Luis Wow
[00:01:17] I finally say this again guess I've had
[00:01:19] bottled it up for such a long time yes I
[00:01:22] did end up winning the competition my
[00:01:24] trophy was right there somewhere so I
[00:01:27] find a guy I could somebody picked it up
[00:01:31] last week so yes I you know I want it
[00:01:33] was an amazing show competing against 11
[00:01:35] other individuals wrong why as you know
[00:01:37] you know he's been competing still for a
[00:01:39] while as well so it was just awesome to
[00:01:41] be up there with him and the other 10
[00:01:44] participants as well aside from us too
[00:01:46] so just an incredible experience to be
[00:01:48] up there with them that's awesome and
[00:01:50] first of all congratulations that was
[00:01:51] awesome I watched the show it was really
[00:01:54] well done and there were some good
[00:01:55] talent there but I yeah I'd say you were
[00:01:58] one of the most entertaining
[00:02:00] electrifying so congrats thanks okay
[00:02:04] like I said I'm gonna get you guys your
[00:02:06] trophies
[00:02:08] Hey I don't know I have four trophies
[00:02:10] but I feel nobody knows about everybody
[00:02:12] millions of people know about that one
[00:02:16] cool so I mean I just wanted to reach
[00:02:19] out and learn a little bit about that
[00:02:22] experience and what you do in the world
[00:02:25] and in memory competitions a little bit
[00:02:26] about your story and I have a lot of
[00:02:28] fans at the moment now so this might be
[00:02:31] a way for them to learn a little more so
[00:02:34] first of all I guess I remember I think
[00:02:38] this was back I might have won the US
[00:02:42] Championship for the first time in 2011
[00:02:43] and I started to see videos of a guy
[00:02:46] named Luis angel and he had this channel
[00:02:50] on YouTube called a key mind and he had
[00:02:53] videos that I watched cuz I won't always
[00:02:55] do some sneaky looking up see who's
[00:02:57] coming up and these videos that said I'm
[00:03:00] gonna win this I'm gonna win that watch
[00:03:02] out Nelson Dellis and I was like oh man
[00:03:05] you know like who's this kid his
[00:03:07] Energy's really intense I was worried so
[00:03:10] that's when I first heard about you and
[00:03:12] of course I met you in in competitions
[00:03:14] after that so tell me from your end how
[00:03:16] did you get into memory and what's your
[00:03:19] background what's your story
[00:03:20] sure well you know first of all four
[00:03:22] games day yeah I remember seeing your
[00:03:24] videos online
[00:03:25] you had posted something like your a
[00:03:26] time I think it was about an average for
[00:03:28] one of the mouths you climb because you
[00:03:29] do that
[00:03:30] Ryan climb all these mountains and you
[00:03:31] were memorizing a deck of cards up don't
[00:03:33] think I was kind of doing that right so
[00:03:37] that was very in tune when I was first
[00:03:39] trying to learn how to really like take
[00:03:41] this to another level
[00:03:42] um you were you know one of my
[00:03:44] inspirations one of my motivation to win
[00:03:45] kick this up and you want to compete so
[00:03:48] I so that's all so that's one of the
[00:03:49] reasons why you know guide to the many
[00:03:51] sports aspect of this but really would
[00:03:53] what drove me to wanna learn this in the
[00:03:55] first place was you know as you know I
[00:03:58] was actually the bad back I was a
[00:04:01] degrading student I had very bad grades
[00:04:03] in high school had one point oh GPA my
[00:04:05] freshman year I kept repeating classes
[00:04:08] over and over again and in college I was
[00:04:10] like alright Fred Spartan is gonna be
[00:04:11] different no same thing happen right
[00:04:14] kept running kept failing dropping out
[00:04:17] glasses it's a point where all they need
[00:04:19] to change this I need to fix this issue
[00:04:21] that I have like what's going on they
[00:04:24] said that I had a DD right attention
[00:04:25] deficit is sorted I couldn't focus on
[00:04:27] one get my mind get going like you know
[00:04:29] this place in that place so I just
[00:04:33] started seeking different information
[00:04:35] different I started reading different
[00:04:37] books contacting different individuals
[00:04:39] and I came across you know as you know
[00:04:40] Ron White and his memory program so I
[00:04:43] went through that and and since then I
[00:04:45] started seeing just huge changes and
[00:04:47] everything from school to personal life
[00:04:49] to work and now you know I compete in
[00:04:51] memory competition competitions
[00:04:53] alongside you we were just in China
[00:04:54] which is a little surreal China and we
[00:04:57] competed in the World Bank competition
[00:04:59] there so that's a quick you know brief
[00:05:01] rundown of how I got into this I was
[00:05:03] struggling I learned the techniques and
[00:05:05] then I started playing then helped me
[00:05:06] out in school so then I wanted to go and
[00:05:09] compete in competitions yeah that's
[00:05:11] great super inspiring and I think what
[00:05:13] what inspires me the most about your
[00:05:15] story is because okay there's wrong why
[00:05:17] there's me there's other competitors
[00:05:20] like we all have our stories you know my
[00:05:22] story was my grandmother
[00:05:23] I turned my memory around because of
[00:05:25] that but your seems like you like you
[00:05:27] said I mean I don't think it gave me the
[00:05:29] whole story but you know you're not
[00:05:31] doing well in school but I think also
[00:05:33] you know you weren't also the most
[00:05:36] successful you were in the neighborhood
[00:05:38] or
[00:05:38] area where it wasn't easy for you to
[00:05:40] kind of gain success but I know and from
[00:05:42] everything you posted that you've worked
[00:05:44] really hard on building yourself and
[00:05:47] your brand and and you've gone to the
[00:05:50] countless workshops read countless books
[00:05:52] and I love that about you that's that's
[00:05:54] a really cool thing and I love that you
[00:05:56] go out and you give back to the
[00:05:58] community every week right yeah so
[00:06:01] that's you're not giving yourself credit
[00:06:03] there's a lot more there than just what
[00:06:05] you told me so Luis angel is the whole
[00:06:07] package your organization you love to
[00:06:14] give back contribute you know you you
[00:06:16] help with the health centers foundations
[00:06:18] I was just in Australia where we helped
[00:06:21] supported the Alzheimer's Association
[00:06:23] there so I love what you're doing with
[00:06:24] that but yeah every single Tuesday we we
[00:06:27] get back out here in in my local
[00:06:29] community we help feed the homeless so
[00:06:31] that's it's been a part of me since I
[00:06:33] was very young
[00:06:33] right but watching people around me do
[00:06:35] that my mom but yeah like he said we
[00:06:37] grew up not having much my mom was going
[00:06:40] out there to these organizations
[00:06:41] churches all these different places to
[00:06:43] get boxes of food to be able to feed us
[00:06:45] when we were younger so I just want to
[00:06:47] feel like I wanted to get back even if
[00:06:49] it's a small portion of either my time
[00:06:51] my energy my efforts whatever it is just
[00:06:53] to people in need so so yeah it's just
[00:06:55] something that I do on a regular basis
[00:06:57] that's good but let's talk about this
[00:07:00] for a second because I love this idea
[00:07:02] that you know there's a lot of people
[00:07:04] out there who want to improve their
[00:07:05] memory and maybe even forget memory they
[00:07:07] want to do something with their lives
[00:07:09] they want to get somewhere goal set and
[00:07:12] achieve those goals and dreams yeah you
[00:07:15] know I know this and you know this we've
[00:07:17] spent a lot of time putting in hours for
[00:07:21] whatever it is whether it's memory
[00:07:23] training or giving back or you know
[00:07:25] reading the books and thinking out plans
[00:07:27] everything tell me how that has been
[00:07:30] important for you because a lot of
[00:07:31] people think that sometimes you just get
[00:07:33] it you that you should probably just got
[00:07:35] a call to be on the show and that was it
[00:07:37] but there's a use of preparation there
[00:07:39] right
[00:07:39] most definitely man and you've been
[00:07:42] apart a few shows you call that that
[00:07:43] whole thing goes it's not like they just
[00:07:46] stumble find you and want to put it on
[00:07:47] one of these Mellie if I need through
[00:07:49] different means but yeah like I have my
[00:07:51] bookshelves here there's one off the
[00:07:53] site but it's full of books here my
[00:07:56] closet is full of books so that's been a
[00:07:58] part of me since I was 18 growing up I
[00:08:00] bet even finish a book in like a year
[00:08:03] right now I'm like read all these books
[00:08:04] and in you know matter of days you know
[00:08:07] I can finish the whole book in a matter
[00:08:09] of days if I really want to focus on
[00:08:10] that but but yeah that's been a huge
[00:08:13] part of my growth and my success up to
[00:08:15] this point is really consuming
[00:08:17] surrounded myself with people that are
[00:08:19] motivating they just don't wanna live
[00:08:23] life kind of just kind of let life pass
[00:08:26] them by right I I surround myself with
[00:08:27] go-getters people you know like yourself
[00:08:29] don't want to go out there and achieve
[00:08:30] great things alike not just somebody
[00:08:33] wants to sell for for less than what
[00:08:35] they're capable of right
[00:08:37] so in all that is a point surrounding
[00:08:39] yourself with the right people reading
[00:08:40] the right books watching the right
[00:08:41] things I watch TV you know I watched a
[00:08:44] few videos in there online but again the
[00:08:46] majority of the classes that I do that I
[00:08:48] do get and you see some of my snap
[00:08:49] sometimes I'm posting like little
[00:08:51] motivational things on my snapchat so
[00:08:53] like videos that I'm watching online or
[00:08:54] audios that I'm hearing kind of just
[00:08:56] like let's see me the idea that I'm
[00:08:59] hearing right just try to motivate
[00:09:00] people any way that I can but also it
[00:09:02] helps me out because I get motivated
[00:09:04] when I listen to that and I share that
[00:09:06] content with others so yeah all of that
[00:09:08] plays a part in growth and success going
[00:09:12] to the event I put tens so many events
[00:09:14] Tony Robbins events you know you know
[00:09:16] that youth on the fire one yourself I've
[00:09:19] done I did the fire walking 8 times now
[00:09:21] and you know each time that I do that
[00:09:24] and literally walking on my flaming hot
[00:09:26] coals every time they do they just it's
[00:09:28] still an uncomfortable even though you
[00:09:30] know that every so you know you're not
[00:09:32] get afraid of feed off but still when
[00:09:34] you get up there you still like oh man
[00:09:35] what if I do / my feet but if this is
[00:09:37] the time where everything goes haywire
[00:09:39] but no you get up there you know get
[00:09:41] nice and relaxed at all the experiences
[00:09:43] your past life or your in your life kind
[00:09:46] of take over at that point and you just
[00:09:48] go you don't second thing you second
[00:09:50] guess or something just go and at the
[00:09:52] end of it you're gonna be very excited
[00:09:53] or you happy that you went through that
[00:09:55] fire walking and that's actually how I'm
[00:09:59] prior to me going up on the stage at the
[00:10:01] the show Superman I know you view that
[00:10:04] as like the longest fire walk of my life
[00:10:06] write me up and again you know how that
[00:10:10] whole thing is like doing the next fire
[00:10:11] why it could be very intense oh I pump
[00:10:14] myself up I you know felt in my chest I
[00:10:17] was burning I you know high energy very
[00:10:19] energetic and then when I put out there
[00:10:20] it kind of just felt like okay I can do
[00:10:23] this now right I can do this because
[00:10:24] I've done these fire box in the past and
[00:10:27] you saw kind of the end result of that
[00:10:29] so it's all about a culmination of
[00:10:31] different things the books that people
[00:10:32] you hang around with you know the things
[00:10:35] you see and they bags to go to so all
[00:10:36] that place huge part in life success
[00:10:39] that's good yeah I hope the people
[00:10:41] watching are I'm sure they're really
[00:10:43] excited to hear that from you I'd love
[00:10:46] to hear let's talk about the super human
[00:10:48] experience
[00:10:48] so you
[00:10:49] the superhuman the champion superhuman
[00:10:53] oh yeah but are you superhuman nah man
[00:10:58] up I'm nerd this just like anybody else
[00:11:01] right anybody can learn how to do this
[00:11:03] it felt like I had these special skills
[00:11:05] that are only reserved for a select few
[00:11:07] people
[00:11:08] well let you yourself you you didn't
[00:11:10] just grow up with this you know but you
[00:11:11] you came out the womb memorizing a deck
[00:11:13] of cards right you know it's something
[00:11:15] that you you build upon you saw what was
[00:11:17] happening in your family with your
[00:11:18] grandma you're like I don't you know I
[00:11:20] don't want that happen to me or the
[00:11:21] people that I love so let me train this
[00:11:23] right now same thing with me you know I
[00:11:25] saw wrong was that I didn't want to be
[00:11:27] in that position for the rest of my life
[00:11:29] so I just train you know I teach others
[00:11:31] how to do this I have videos online and
[00:11:32] you know I go and teach students so it's
[00:11:35] something that anybody can learn even
[00:11:37] the other people up on that stage
[00:11:38] they'll tell you some of them definitely
[00:11:40] do have gifts you know natural abilities
[00:11:42] like John the guy with the different
[00:11:44] cubes it was like eighteen thousand
[00:11:46] pieces I looked at that wall I have that
[00:11:48] sort of no clue see how he was trying to
[00:11:50] explain it to me I'm like dude that's
[00:11:52] just gift you know that's a natural gift
[00:11:54] natural ability you know I know a lot of
[00:11:56] these other people you seen here
[00:11:57] definitely natural gift and also a lot
[00:11:59] of train a lot of our vertical one to
[00:12:01] make both run and you know obviously
[00:12:03] trained heavily for this so a lot of a
[00:12:06] lot of the people there's some of them
[00:12:07] just natural gifts and a lot of them
[00:12:09] though it's just putting in the hours
[00:12:11] putting the type in in the effort to be
[00:12:13] able to do what we were able to do along
[00:12:15] the stage yeah I worry I don't know I
[00:12:17] think you snare as a good friend of mine
[00:12:19] we're both from Miami and we used to
[00:12:21] meet up for lunch at like Chipotle just
[00:12:24] to tell you about his techniques my
[00:12:26] techniques and you know he always felt
[00:12:29] like the things I could do were just a
[00:12:31] bit too hard for him and then likewise
[00:12:33] for him even though we were both like we
[00:12:36] have the the mental calculation in the
[00:12:38] memorization world they kind of overlap
[00:12:40] a little bit but he's a little too
[00:12:43] advanced on that end and I think I'm too
[00:12:44] little best for his own but I think he
[00:12:47] was telling me that the guy with the
[00:12:48] stickers was it had something to do with
[00:12:52] some you know how you doing the magic I
[00:12:54] write something was crossing my eyes and
[00:12:56] trying to see these minor details but
[00:12:58] still even if that's the case I have no
[00:13:00] idea how he was able to pinpoint once
[00:13:02] cific sticker and rubik's cube size
[00:13:04] sticker crazy no that's ridiculous I
[00:13:06] have through that all the time and again
[00:13:09] he was saying that like yeah it's just
[00:13:10] you paranoia you know bring it one image
[00:13:13] of top of the other and then the image
[00:13:15] pops up the little key pops up the
[00:13:17] difference a plate do I started there
[00:13:19] for 20 minutes I still can't figure it
[00:13:21] out the three these images I can get
[00:13:22] those really quickly there but obviously
[00:13:28] still worked on edit
[00:13:30] he has his natural ability but he still
[00:13:31] has some you know putting the type in
[00:13:33] the effort to just make it even better
[00:13:35] and get a computer yes
[00:13:36] you know the shoot a missile in that
[00:13:38] show yeah I'm excited to see them come
[00:13:41] back with the next season and who they
[00:13:42] pick out this time you Wow bring you
[00:13:47] back there's a whole story will get is s
[00:13:51] way but I asked me yeah so I guess one
[00:13:58] question would ask you is what was it
[00:14:00] like being on the show I mean there you
[00:14:04] were in parts of other shows and I think
[00:14:06] you had like we have talked about
[00:14:08] recently previously that there's another
[00:14:10] show opportunities that came and didn't
[00:14:12] fall they kind of fell through or you
[00:14:15] did get kind of secondary parts here
[00:14:17] there but nothing like this right so how
[00:14:19] did you even prepare for that and
[00:14:20] defining itself the actual memory task
[00:14:23] you have to do yeah so this has been you
[00:14:27] know this is been around two years over
[00:14:30] two years now the entire process where
[00:14:32] it was on one network and then they
[00:14:34] didn't like I said meter so my buddy
[00:14:36] flips we submitted different things
[00:14:38] different videos that didn't like it for
[00:14:40] whatever reason I think they liked
[00:14:42] meeting ball on the show I don't know
[00:14:47] and then last year last year we you know
[00:14:51] I got the call again and say hey I got
[00:14:54] picked up by this other network you can
[00:14:56] tell you but it's a big network if you
[00:14:58] want to get rid of the shot so like
[00:15:00] alright cool I submit another video I
[00:15:02] just it was like me against five other
[00:15:04] people I was a little memory challenge
[00:15:06] that I had
[00:15:07] no matter demonstration and I submit to
[00:15:11] them and you know months went by they we
[00:15:13] had to submit other video content like
[00:15:16] alright the producers a likeness how
[00:15:17] about you send this video send us this
[00:15:19] audio clip different things you know
[00:15:21] sends paperwork all these different
[00:15:23] things that they requested for me and I
[00:15:25] would do it sometimes it would take me a
[00:15:27] while to get back to just because you
[00:15:29] know I have a life and I have to be out
[00:15:31] there giving speeches and teaching
[00:15:32] people so there was definitely a time
[00:15:35] throughout the process that I actually
[00:15:36] just wanted a stock doing it just
[00:15:38] because of helping Maggie
[00:15:39] it was way to submit this myth that we
[00:15:41] need this tell a myth so and other
[00:15:44] issues as well well II know I just don't
[00:15:46] want to do this I don't watch TV so I'm
[00:15:48] fine I can get on it
[00:15:50] so it's a very demanding process to get
[00:15:54] a show on TV it's such a long thing and
[00:15:57] then you put so much effort in so much
[00:15:59] of the time it doesn't even go through
[00:16:00] right exactly and you just shows that
[00:16:04] Dengeki Bunko that have been on the air
[00:16:07] National Geographic Patrol it shows I
[00:16:09] did one with Nat Geo I'm Nick Davis why
[00:16:13] wasn't this one was another one another
[00:16:15] one actual shows that's why didn't show
[00:16:28] me that much but um but yeah so this
[00:16:30] yeah those other shows fell through
[00:16:32] didn't come through you know and this
[00:16:34] one finally a month before we shot it
[00:16:37] fine staff all right I remember we were
[00:16:40] I think it was in May right we were at
[00:16:42] the exit in San Diego you know last year
[00:16:44] and we were kind of talking about it and
[00:16:47] they still hadn't told me like okay I'm
[00:16:49] gonna be donor you're not gonna be on so
[00:16:52] they told me like a month before we
[00:16:55] actually shot that I was gonna be on all
[00:16:58] the garlic whoo awesome however for this
[00:17:00] it's only my challenge or they told me a
[00:17:01] little bit eh so my challenges
[00:17:03] exactly what all did it do the sales
[00:17:05] gonna revolve around namespaces and
[00:17:07] hotels so you know as you know yeah just
[00:17:10] products I put in time and then a friend
[00:17:13] I use your software a lot to trade that
[00:17:15] software so I would submit because there
[00:17:18] every week don't wonder you saying like
[00:17:19] checkup videos just to make sure that
[00:17:21] will actually preparing for this so we
[00:17:23] said you know videos would be training
[00:17:25] using your software that's aunty
[00:17:28] software actually monitoring turning a
[00:17:29] software which is very helpful
[00:17:31] throughout this entire process and yes I
[00:17:34] sent that in and then when we actually
[00:17:36] went up there we shot it in June and
[00:17:40] yeah I met up with everybody met up with
[00:17:43] Ron even though to that point he was
[00:17:45] still kind of giving me advice gave me
[00:17:46] tips which is awesome he's always been a
[00:17:48] few child and yeah then we shot it and
[00:17:52] you know the results we're showing a
[00:17:55] life that what not like to be with her
[00:17:56] show into America many people tuned in
[00:17:59] which is awesome last week so it was a
[00:18:02] cool little process that's good and now
[00:18:04] I loved your reaction at the end because
[00:18:06] I genuinely believe that you didn't have
[00:18:10] any idea that you were gonna bring it's
[00:18:12] like I felt I felt that feeling that you
[00:18:15] showed where it's like it's just like
[00:18:17] I'm kidding me just like oh yeah I mean
[00:18:19] it was awesome so I mean you had no idea
[00:18:22] that at that point like in the filming
[00:18:24] of the show that you had walked right
[00:18:25] absolutely not man so I did my challenge
[00:18:28] I completed that and that's the one
[00:18:30] thing that long would you know you kept
[00:18:31] talking about listen it's awesome that
[00:18:34] if you win you know whatever I want me
[00:18:37] to just focus on your challenge have fun
[00:18:38] with a focus on your challenge but
[00:18:40] that's essentially what I did I focused
[00:18:41] on my telling I wanted to do good on
[00:18:43] that how to memorize over 500 pieces of
[00:18:45] information at the end of the day and I
[00:18:48] you know I didn't you know I saw that I
[00:18:49] get it and that was awesome just about
[00:18:51] my mom did my family there I was in just
[00:18:54] that no was an incredible experience
[00:18:56] right if it ended there I would've been
[00:18:58] happy so I was just happy with that
[00:19:01] then at the end we're all standing there
[00:19:03] was showing our clips and we were
[00:19:05] setting up a lot before they voted on
[00:19:07] thing all right cool everybody was
[00:19:08] awesome I didn't get to see anybody's
[00:19:09] challenge at that point because I was
[00:19:11] last but I just seen them a quick
[00:19:14] rundown
[00:19:14] oh man that's awesome and I think I'm
[00:19:16] pretty sure these people we're dry they
[00:19:18] have a better chance a way to do because
[00:19:20] I don't think that what I did was really
[00:19:23] you know that powerful aren't powerful
[00:19:25] enough to win over the audience vote but
[00:19:27] because I thought other people they have
[00:19:29] props I had this I have that more visual
[00:19:32] things up on stage like the laser maze
[00:19:34] and you know different things of that
[00:19:35] nature but when they find set Cowpens
[00:19:38] goes and the winner is you know the man
[00:19:41] be master am I supposed to opened up my
[00:19:43] eyes and I thought it was run that point
[00:19:47] I had no clue that they referred to me
[00:19:49] as a very mastery so all right Ron won
[00:19:52] so I was gonna go over it and then he
[00:19:58] says my name and I'll just like and
[00:20:00] that's where we actually got where I
[00:20:01] turned around I was discombobulated for
[00:20:03] a while like what is going on here I had
[00:20:05] no clue just had happen at that point
[00:20:08] and and yeah it was definitely surreal
[00:20:11] moment I had no clue obviously that was
[00:20:13] that that was gonna happen I was just
[00:20:15] happy for me to do my challenge and then
[00:20:16] when I heard my name I was like oh I'm
[00:20:21] so happy for you I mean but you know I
[00:20:23] mean you know give yourself that much
[00:20:24] credit but the you know I think the
[00:20:27] audience voted on the whole package
[00:20:29] right like what memorably stuck out in
[00:20:31] their mind you know what I mean like it
[00:20:33] wasn't just because yeah I agree there
[00:20:36] were in my opinion if I had to go based
[00:20:38] on like the coolness or a difficult or
[00:20:42] craziness of one of the tasks the
[00:20:45] stickers for me would have been very
[00:20:47] that was the craziness cuz I have no
[00:20:49] idea how he did it even if there was a
[00:20:50] technique I don't think I could learn it
[00:20:52] that easily where is the memory stuff we
[00:20:55] could teach that's what we do you know
[00:20:57] so it has to be a combination of Union
[00:21:00] personality your charisma on stage so
[00:21:01] Bravo that was good I guess I'm curious
[00:21:07] and I guess people who watch the show or
[00:21:09] a fans of yours now what's what's next
[00:21:12] what are you doing in 2016
[00:21:14] but you know what if I guess what am i
[00:21:17] doing um right now we're doing the
[00:21:19] qualifier for the X and T that you might
[00:21:21] return minute sure
[00:21:22] think so I'll open it and do it very
[00:21:24] well to qualify for that now I'm
[00:21:26] definitely show up when that comes
[00:21:27] around so that's this year well so the X
[00:21:30] M T is a memory tournament I started and
[00:21:32] we have these online qualifiers to
[00:21:35] extreme memory tournament calm if you
[00:21:37] want to check that out and Louis wants
[00:21:39] to compete that's what you're saying but
[00:21:41] also even in the past two years Luis has
[00:21:43] been very helpful in helping with the
[00:21:45] social media and organization of the
[00:21:47] event we have it every year we've had it
[00:21:50] every year for the past two years going
[00:21:51] on three in San Diego and so either way
[00:21:54] you're part of it so yeah what am i I
[00:21:58] think I have you competed in it but just
[00:22:01] doing the qualifiers I know I have done
[00:22:03] best that'll notice I think it's the
[00:22:06] most entertaining for me the most fun
[00:22:08] memory challenge that I've done and I
[00:22:11] competed you know a different
[00:22:12] competition but I think this one alone
[00:22:14] because it's quick it's fast the
[00:22:17] training itself I mean you can easily
[00:22:18] train for all these events very quickly
[00:22:20] now it doesn't take like you know hours
[00:22:22] upon hours like these other events so I
[00:22:25] really enjoy your competition you
[00:22:27] doesn't vary very much no good alright
[00:22:30] so there's that what else what do you
[00:22:31] see anyway so yeah that we have I mean
[00:22:34] I'm just gonna continue to do I mean
[00:22:35] people I've been asked them so are you
[00:22:36] gonna go and just spend all that money
[00:22:38] and one I have a guy in the money yes
[00:22:40] all right you want $100,000 yeah when it
[00:22:45] comes down be very happy but definitely
[00:22:48] Obama's game is cut but up first
[00:22:50] but you know what side the money comes
[00:22:52] in it definitely it's just gonna be same
[00:22:54] as usual I'm gonna continue to go and
[00:22:56] get back I help out orphanages in Mexico
[00:22:58] I want to start on my own nonprofit
[00:22:59] organization I want to just continue to
[00:23:04] teach other people is expand my my
[00:23:06] business I teach other schools not just
[00:23:08] here in LA but across the nation I do
[00:23:10] more online material you know hire some
[00:23:12] people to help me create more online
[00:23:14] content so it's just business as usual
[00:23:17] and just more of a that's all
[00:23:19] don't consider to get back continue to
[00:23:21] build business and continue to teach
[00:23:22] others so that's it maybe go on a few
[00:23:24] trips during their few point trips aside
[00:23:26] from memory competitions because even
[00:23:28] though you know I've gone to Australia
[00:23:29] I've got all these places but when
[00:23:31] you're there it's kind of hard to go out
[00:23:33] and have fun because you're still
[00:23:35] thinking about the competition right
[00:23:36] you're so good you know I'm prepared so
[00:23:40] I want to just go to somewhere I don't
[00:23:44] know a different places either in the
[00:23:46] nation around the world and not compete
[00:23:48] that we can just go and have fun so then
[00:23:50] you know just pretty fun I want to I
[00:23:51] want to do that this year
[00:23:53] okay that's good are some travels gonna
[00:23:57] be for competitions and I say the xmt
[00:24:00] but are you looking at other
[00:24:01] international memory competitions yeah I
[00:24:05] think April or May I might go and do
[00:24:09] this Japan one Japanese no competition
[00:24:11] or possibly even the Philippines one I'm
[00:24:14] not sure yet but other than that I got
[00:24:16] the want to go to Europe going to the
[00:24:17] London one go do the German one so I
[00:24:20] want to go out there and do some
[00:24:22] competitions that died in Spain won but
[00:24:24] yeah I don't want to go back to Monday
[00:24:25] we were in London 2012 that was awesome
[00:24:27] it's my first year in competition but I
[00:24:30] definitely go back to England and do
[00:24:32] that yeah and I guess talking about
[00:24:35] memory I'm sure a lot of people I there
[00:24:39] was the scientist on the show that kind
[00:24:40] of explained what you were doing but I
[00:24:43] didn't think is it hit right on the note
[00:24:46] because he's maybe not as aware as you
[00:24:48] what you do but what are the techniques
[00:24:51] that you use because you had to memorize
[00:24:52] what was it four hundred pieces of
[00:24:55] information 500 yes so it's 100 people
[00:24:59] Oh people first name last name initial
[00:25:02] which is different they just firstly
[00:25:04] right there's another piece of data you
[00:25:06] have the city and state and that's right
[00:25:09] something about the person you know the
[00:25:10] long hair lids from that you know have
[00:25:13] different features of a person and and
[00:25:15] also memorize that part so I so the
[00:25:19] total over 500 so I yeah pretty much I
[00:25:23] just really sorry but you saw Paris as I
[00:25:25] saw the Eiffel Tower coming out
[00:25:26] snake thrilling she caught you don't do
[00:25:30] then date like a few then they didn't
[00:25:33] actually say like Joe age I remember I
[00:25:36] said that he reminded me of my teacher
[00:25:39] who gave me an ass biology so you know I
[00:25:43] was just connecting the people that I
[00:25:44] saw up on the screening or that I may
[00:25:46] ever know that I memorize like Misha
[00:25:48] with things that are familiar with or
[00:25:51] just images and stories that I created
[00:25:53] an associate with people themselves and
[00:25:57] that's pretty much how we all do it
[00:25:58] right just their stories so the name the
[00:26:02] first name I'm familiar with that you
[00:26:04] know I just come up with a picture
[00:26:06] attach it to the future then you have to
[00:26:08] do the initial so I'm sure out of 100
[00:26:10] people you know you had at least four
[00:26:15] repeats of each or something you know I
[00:26:16] mean like on average so did you just
[00:26:19] whatever came to your mind you connected
[00:26:21] the lighter somehow to some word that
[00:26:23] letter started with like what was Paris
[00:26:26] Paris s yeah so you thought of like her
[00:26:30] hair was kind of snaky is that so the S
[00:26:34] is you know oh yeah you know that's what
[00:26:40] snakes for me um that's impersonate
[00:26:43] these were dogs that's what you saw me
[00:26:45] with that one sitting a sturdy because I
[00:26:47] thought it was maybe I saw an animal
[00:26:48] probably another Eiffel Tower so I
[00:26:50] didn't know at first if it was a snake
[00:26:52] or dogs I saw an animal up there and
[00:26:57] then I didn't actually I think all of
[00:27:00] them they show that on the actual show
[00:27:02] but when I was there I filled up with
[00:27:04] the holding well think wait it could be
[00:27:05] this or it could be that when I saw a
[00:27:07] tail coming out so is it a mouse and M
[00:27:09] or is it a cat a C so you know few of
[00:27:12] those kind of threw me off for a loop I
[00:27:14] should have definitely some more time I
[00:27:16] didn't spend that much time ahead you
[00:27:18] know beforehand when I was training
[00:27:20] because I guess just uh there I could
[00:27:21] easily memorize a letter right how hard
[00:27:23] could it be but when I was actually
[00:27:25] there doing it definitely with that many
[00:27:28] people right if it was just maybe ten
[00:27:30] fit
[00:27:31] with that many people were definitely
[00:27:33] some of that kind of you know mix them
[00:27:36] with other images or other stories that
[00:27:37] I created so that kind of threw me off I
[00:27:40] just took my time and I really relaxed
[00:27:42] and I just let the image just really
[00:27:44] come out and again a little bit more
[00:27:46] vivid than they were when I first saw
[00:27:48] them yeah cool and then for the city and
[00:27:51] the state did you because I do that in
[00:27:54] the u.s. championship they have
[00:27:55] something similar obviously not with a
[00:27:56] hundred people but I usually just listen
[00:27:58] to the city and then I usually know
[00:28:00] where it is in the state so I don't have
[00:28:02] to memorize that was it similar or did
[00:28:04] you actually have a system for both city
[00:28:06] and state yeah no it was so I had the
[00:28:10] states they had the images when you and
[00:28:13] Golden Gate Bridge right so I hated that
[00:28:16] so each state had I had images for the
[00:28:20] state Texas with just a Boop so I had an
[00:28:23] image for the state and then on that the
[00:28:25] cities I mean cities could be in any
[00:28:27] state
[00:28:28] I mean Springfield yeah Mike I didn't
[00:28:30] know how you would afford as well right
[00:28:33] so the cities I couldn't it wasn't like
[00:28:36] I could just memorize a city and state a
[00:28:38] pair and you could just have one answer
[00:28:41] there yeah so I had to do that
[00:28:43] separately himself or me and and yes I
[00:28:46] definitely spent time doing that and I
[00:28:48] like the top500 season the United States
[00:28:51] ahead of time and I can research Sam
[00:28:53] right and then I create some quick
[00:28:54] images for that and obviously when I was
[00:28:56] there I met people that were from other
[00:28:58] cities that I didn't have to determine
[00:28:59] images or so I had to create them on the
[00:29:02] spot there's actually people that I
[00:29:03] memorize like the information of that
[00:29:05] weren't even from the United States and
[00:29:06] I had no clue that they're gonna be like
[00:29:08] foreigners are so we have to inform like
[00:29:10] Italy and people from the Philippines
[00:29:12] and so I definitely had to be very
[00:29:15] creative with some of those you know
[00:29:16] with foreigners now we're in the
[00:29:18] audience interesting and then how much
[00:29:20] time did you get with each person they
[00:29:24] showed in line saying hi I'm sure they
[00:29:26] sped it up or cut it what was the real
[00:29:29] like interaction time yeah so it was so
[00:29:34] they gave they show this on there but
[00:29:36] they gave me like review cards so they
[00:29:38] gave me cards where I had a picture the
[00:29:40] name
[00:29:41] and the city so I hold information on
[00:29:43] the review cards and that's I poke it
[00:29:47] down I had a comparable comparable
[00:29:48] amount of time that say Ron had on his
[00:29:51] challenge but I had about two minutes
[00:29:53] under two minutes per person to kind of
[00:29:56] you know memorize all the information so
[00:29:58] uh yeah and then just just so I can get
[00:30:01] the idea when you actually shook their
[00:30:02] hand how long was that interaction did
[00:30:05] you like hang on for a second or were
[00:30:07] you just like this is the first way
[00:30:09] through and then you've got a second
[00:30:11] review with the pictures how did it work
[00:30:12] yeah so now I just met some people like
[00:30:15] when we were there we shook their hands
[00:30:17] and and then the actual memorization
[00:30:19] came when I was you know I'm doing the
[00:30:22] the club's back stage got it cool yeah I
[00:30:25] mean I a lot of us memory guys do the
[00:30:28] name thing before a speech and we'll
[00:30:30] schmooze before and you know I've also
[00:30:34] had to do some things like that where
[00:30:36] they give you a line of people 30 plus
[00:30:39] 50 plus people and you got to shake
[00:30:41] their hand next next next and then they
[00:30:42] quiz you
[00:30:43] that's actually really hard one thing I
[00:30:46] think it was wrong that told me this
[00:30:47] ages ago is when he does that in his
[00:30:50] talks is don't leave the conversation
[00:30:52] until you have the person's name in your
[00:30:54] mind for sure so what you do is you
[00:30:56] shake hands you get the name but you
[00:30:59] also converse a little bit while you're
[00:31:00] doing this mental process I think
[00:31:01] there's a little trick there to make
[00:31:04] sure you have it before you move on to
[00:31:06] the next one it's hard to make that
[00:31:07] rapid-fire handshake thing it's doable
[00:31:10] but it's showing you just like two
[00:31:17] seconds with them for a millisecond like
[00:31:19] no that's not exactly you know they did
[00:31:20] that for visual effect for the show and
[00:31:22] actually a lot of more challenges they
[00:31:24] definitely edited editing down we oughta
[00:31:26] give them will memorize or Garrett
[00:31:28] challenges but it wasn't that fast right
[00:31:30] and go ahead you know spend some time
[00:31:33] doing that and the same thing with with
[00:31:35] you know I go out and when I do my talks
[00:31:38] during my like corporate talks I meet
[00:31:41] the people and I do the whole name thing
[00:31:42] um but yeah it with that we just do
[00:31:45] first names so it's it's a little easier
[00:31:47] than what we would we did for the show
[00:31:49] Ron had to do for
[00:31:50] first name and you got a new phone
[00:31:53] number and you also had to do yeah like
[00:31:55] a fact about them so that's tough to be
[00:31:58] able to do all of that like as you know
[00:31:59] when we do the talk you just a first
[00:32:01] thing so it's a little-bitty
[00:32:01] it's still tough but you know it's more
[00:32:03] doable than something like this that's
[00:32:05] what we spent more time doing like on
[00:32:07] the show just because there's more data
[00:32:09] pack on two inch person so it's a longer
[00:32:11] story instead of just the first thing
[00:32:12] now your name is Joe I picture sake Joe
[00:32:14] cool next you know your name is sandy
[00:32:16] just sat on your face cool next that's a
[00:32:18] little you know you could do that
[00:32:20] festival when you have city and say you
[00:32:21] have to create all these different
[00:32:22] stories you have to spend a little more
[00:32:24] time to review it and kind of some
[00:32:26] mentals those visuals in your mind
[00:32:28] that's right yeah Wow still impressive I

=== 2016 XMT Qualifiers + Sample Submission Video ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S9lGDgfkCA

[00:00:03] welcome to the 2016 extreme memory
[00:00:06] tournament qualifiers we did this last
[00:00:08] year to this side of the top 24
[00:00:11] competitors we get to compete in the
[00:00:13] 2016 extreme memory tournament finals
[00:00:16] will be held this year jun 24 through 26
[00:00:19] in San Diego California at the dark
[00:00:23] neuroscience office building to get into
[00:00:25] this competition you need to qualify the
[00:00:27] top eight seeds are already taken and
[00:00:30] those are given to the top eight from
[00:00:32] the 2015 extra memory tournament so the
[00:00:34] extreme memory tournament qualifiers
[00:00:36] will be deciding the remaining 16 slots
[00:00:40] so how does it fall four hours work well
[00:00:42] if you go to the website training dot
[00:00:44] extreme memory tournament com it's a
[00:00:47] training site for the competition you'll
[00:00:50] see that there is a qualifications tab
[00:00:52] that is right there now starting January
[00:00:55] 11th next Monday for five consecutive
[00:00:57] weeks every week will be one of those
[00:01:00] disciplines and you have to submit your
[00:01:02] best score you have the whole week to
[00:01:04] try up to five times and you must admit
[00:01:07] that score before the week is up along
[00:01:10] with the video that you've taped in
[00:01:11] yourself every week there's a new
[00:01:13] discipline we're signing those cards
[00:01:14] that images and names the numbers and
[00:01:18] finally with words the scores you get
[00:01:20] from those will be based on the world
[00:01:22] record which could be seen on the
[00:01:23] website whoever has the most points at
[00:01:25] the end of those five weeks the top 16
[00:01:28] will make it the final tournament in
[00:01:30] June so in terms of changes nothing much
[00:01:33] has changed in terms of the disciplines
[00:01:35] the events the rules the only thing for
[00:01:37] the qualifiers we're going to be very
[00:01:39] strict on filming the videos you submit
[00:01:42] must adhere to the requirements that we
[00:01:45] say so specifically the camera needs to
[00:01:48] be set up from behind at such an angle
[00:01:51] that you can see the screen you're
[00:01:53] performing the task on you can see your
[00:01:56] face or the back of your head with a
[00:01:59] side of your head
[00:02:00] and your hands on the surface that you
[00:02:02] may have staged a table or a desk there
[00:02:05] must be no pens or pencils or pieces of
[00:02:08] paper free I don't expect you to clear
[00:02:11] off your whole desk but at least have
[00:02:13] things tidy so that it doesn't look like
[00:02:15] anything can be going on there the point
[00:02:19] here is to avoid cheating and on that
[00:02:22] note we have zero tolerance for that if
[00:02:25] we suspect anybody from cheating in one
[00:02:27] of these videos we reserve the right to
[00:02:29] not approve the video so when you're on
[00:02:33] the website you have five attempts which
[00:02:35] can be done throughout the week but the
[00:02:37] attempt and the video the uploaded link
[00:02:40] to the video must be posted before
[00:02:44] midnight on the sunday of that week we
[00:02:47] had some issues last year where some
[00:02:50] people had actually done the task but
[00:02:52] hadn't submitted the video even though
[00:02:53] the video was recorded where it was
[00:02:55] uploaded to YouTube you got to get it in
[00:02:57] no exceptions before that deadline so
[00:03:00] the valid period is between monday at 12
[00:03:04] a.m. UTC time to sunday at midnight UTC
[00:03:08] time i will be showing an example of
[00:03:10] what a valid video looks like since the
[00:03:14] first week is cards you'll be seeing me

=== Nelson Dellis on Dr. Oz 2012 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndltB1IsjjA

[00:00:00] We're back with my superpower H hour and
[00:00:02] now I'm going to charge up your memory
[00:00:04] and your concentration. To help us out,
[00:00:06] meet a man who never forgets a thing. He
[00:00:09] says anyone can have a super memory and
[00:00:11] he's got a super food to recharge your
[00:00:13] memory for years to come. Let's bring in
[00:00:15] Nelson Delos, two-time winner of the US
[00:00:18] Memory Championship. I have no idea how
[00:00:20] you do that. Uh but you've acknowledged
[00:00:21] that you don't have a super memory. You
[00:00:22] weren't born with one anyway. So, what
[00:00:24] got you inspired to get into this area?
[00:00:26] So I started training uh my memory
[00:00:28] actually when my grandmother she passed
[00:00:30] away from Alzheimer's disease about
[00:00:32] three years ago and I wanted to do more
[00:00:36] for my mind. I wanted that not to happen
[00:00:38] to me. So I I started practicing and
[00:00:40] learning techniques and this started
[00:00:42] three years ago. Yeah. I want to never
[00:00:44] had a good memory before that. I want to
[00:00:45] know what the superfood you're eating
[00:00:46] is. All right. Before we get to that,
[00:00:48] during the commercial break, I asked
[00:00:49] Nelson to memorize the birthdays of the
[00:00:51] first two rows of my audience. And now
[00:00:54] we're about to quiz them. Are you ready,
[00:00:55] Nelson? Let's do it. All right. So, if I
[00:00:57] could ask the first two rows to stand
[00:00:59] and keep your birthdays hidden there.
[00:01:00] All right. Take it away, Nelson. All
[00:01:02] right. So, over here we have 1205.
[00:01:06] Yes. Uh, and over here we have uh
[00:01:09] 0916. Then we have
[00:01:12] 0426,
[00:01:14] 0530, 0323.
[00:01:17] You're kidding me.
[00:01:18] 1018. Um
[00:01:21] 0908
[00:01:23] 1217. Um hold on. It's um 09 uh 0912
[00:01:30] and 0515.
[00:01:32] Oh my
[00:01:33] goodness. That is so good. There you go.
[00:01:37] Have a seat, guys. That's fabulous.
[00:01:39] That's So what's the secret to building
[00:01:40] such a strong memory? So it's a few
[00:01:42] things. Um the first thing is I I
[00:01:44] practice every day. Um, I employ this
[00:01:47] technique called the memory palace where
[00:01:49] I imagine myself in my house and I walk
[00:01:52] through it mentally storing pictures of
[00:01:54] lists of things I want to remember. So,
[00:01:56] if I'm going to go to the grocery store
[00:01:58] and I have to remember 10 items, so say
[00:02:00] I have to get toilet paper and cheese
[00:02:02] are the first two items, I might be at
[00:02:04] my doorstep and I'm going to picture,
[00:02:06] you know, throwing toilet paper maybe
[00:02:08] wrapped in some moldy cheese at the
[00:02:10] front door. And then you go to the next
[00:02:12] place, might be the entrance to your
[00:02:14] your house or apartment, and you put the
[00:02:15] next two words there, etc. And to
[00:02:17] remember it, you just walk right back
[00:02:19] through that place, and you'll remember
[00:02:20] the pictures that were there. And what's
[00:02:21] the technique called again? The memory
[00:02:23] palace. Memory palace. Yeah. So, I do
[00:02:26] that. Um, I another thing I do that's
[00:02:27] very important is is diet. So, what's
[00:02:29] the superfood that you you've been
[00:02:31] holding secrets from me on? Yeah. You
[00:02:32] know, I I I love fruits and vegetables,
[00:02:34] typically ones that are high in
[00:02:36] antioxidants, um colorful fruits, but my
[00:02:39] favorite are goji berries. Goji berries.
[00:02:42] Yeah. Here, come on over here. Sure.
[00:02:43] You've got goji berries set up for you.
[00:02:45] Why do you think goji berries are so
[00:02:47] marvelous? So, there's a few things
[00:02:48] that's great about them. The first thing
[00:02:49] is that they're high in beta carotene,
[00:02:52] which is found in carrots. Um, and it
[00:02:54] helps keep your mind sharp. Uh, the
[00:02:56] other thing is that they're high in
[00:02:57] vitamin C, even more so than oranges,
[00:03:00] believe it or not. And that helps kind
[00:03:01] of fight the aging of of of your brain.
[00:03:04] And then my favorite is the fact that
[00:03:06] they have a lot of vitamin B as well,
[00:03:08] which uh helps lower homoine levels,
[00:03:10] which is an amino acid that's linked to
[00:03:13] uh Alzheimer's disease. Yeah. And
[00:03:14] hardening of the arteries also. You
[00:03:16] know, they also have a lot of iron in
[00:03:17] them, which can help with fatigue. Uh so
[00:03:19] I guess I talked about goji berries in
[00:03:21] the show before. I've never thought
[00:03:22] about them in the context of memory. I
[00:03:23] usually have folks eat about five
[00:03:25] tablespoon fulls of goji berries. Uh if
[00:03:27] it helps with your concentration, I'll
[00:03:28] give you more. Yes, please. How much How
[00:03:30] much do you eat usually? Oh man, I'll go
[00:03:32] through a bag like just like this pretty
[00:03:33] quickly. I take them on the go in my
[00:03:36] car. Just throw them in my mouth. It's
[00:03:38] They taste like raisins. A little
[00:03:39] tarter. Yeah. Like cranberry raisins.
[00:03:40] Every health food store has them.
[00:03:41] They're in a lot of grocery stores these
[00:03:43] days. And I say you add them in a salad.
[00:03:46] You can put just yogurt everything.
[00:03:47] Right. Awesome. Yeah. Who's had a goji
[00:03:49] berry here?
[00:03:51] Oh, so few people. We have changed some
[00:03:53] lives. We've got some people to have
[00:03:55] better memories. Listen,
[00:03:56] congratulations. And I'm sorry about my
[00:03:58] grandmother, but I'm glad you woke me
[00:03:59] up. Up next, meet my favorite superw
[00:04:01] women who are sharing their secret
[00:04:02] weapons and getting things done better
[00:04:04] and faster. The tricks will change your
[00:04:06] life.

=== Nintendo 3DS Brain Age - Memory Champ Challenge ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrE-H9O8ejw

[00:00:18] now available exclusively on Nintendo
[00:00:24] 3DS hello my name is Nelson dellis and
[00:00:27] I've spent thousands of hours training
[00:00:29] my brain to become a two-time USA memory
[00:00:31] champion and a Grandmaster of memory
[00:00:34] Nintendo challenged me and my brain to
[00:00:36] see how well a memory Champion could do
[00:00:38] against the more difficult brain
[00:00:39] exercises in the new entry in the Brain
[00:00:41] Age franchise Brain Age concentration
[00:00:43] training the Brain Age series was
[00:00:45] developed along with a Japanese
[00:00:46] neuroscientist named Dr ryuta kawashima
[00:00:50] in 2006 for the Nintendo DS platform it
[00:00:53] was a huge hit when millions of people
[00:00:55] discovered how fun it was to train their
[00:00:56] brains in minutes a day now the Brain
[00:00:59] Age series has its first ever
[00:01:00] installment on the Nintendo 3DS platform
[00:01:03] with all new exercises called devilish
[00:01:05] training I'm sure many of you are
[00:01:06] familiar with this problem where there's
[00:01:08] so much going on in our everyday lives
[00:01:11] whether it's school or work friends and
[00:01:13] family things like email text messages
[00:01:16] social media cat memes easily distract
[00:01:19] and overload us with information making
[00:01:22] it hard to focus on just one task at a
[00:01:24] time the new devilish training exercises
[00:01:26] in brainage concentration training are
[00:01:29] designed to add address these issues and
[00:01:31] help refine your working memory which is
[00:01:33] essential for better focus and
[00:01:34] concentration overall it's a great game
[00:01:37] to take a break with during your busy
[00:01:38] hectic schedule and the activities can
[00:01:40] be played in just 5 minutes a day I'm
[00:01:42] going to challenge my brain on two
[00:01:43] different devilish training exercises
[00:01:46] one key aspect of these new devilish
[00:01:47] training exercises is the difficulty
[00:01:49] scale the better I do the more
[00:01:51] challenging the exercise gets judging by
[00:01:54] this metal I have a feeling that the
[00:01:55] challenge level is about to get pretty
[00:01:57] high devil shapes there'll be a series
[00:01:59] of of shapes on the screen that I need
[00:02:01] to identify but here's the tricky part
[00:02:03] instead of identifying the shape
[00:02:05] currently on the screen I have to
[00:02:06] identify the previous one if I do well I
[00:02:09] can go back as far as two shapes three
[00:02:11] maybe
[00:02:19] four
[00:02:21] okay that's the
[00:02:28] stuff
[00:02:30] all right so I was able to get 20 back
[00:02:32] on devilish shapes pretty tricky but I
[00:02:34] got it okay on to the next challenge
[00:02:36] devilish calculations where I have to
[00:02:38] answer a series of math problems it has
[00:02:40] the same concept as devilish shapes but
[00:02:43] with math questions this time and that's
[00:02:45] what makes these exercise is so
[00:02:46] effective it's not about simple
[00:02:48] memorization it's all about memorizing
[00:02:50] the problem processing the answer and
[00:02:52] then recalling that
[00:02:58] answer
[00:03:10] for devilish calculations I was able to
[00:03:12] get up to 30 back which is pretty good
[00:03:15] but that's because I love
[00:03:17] numbers please remember that I'm a
[00:03:18] two-time USA memory Champion so I've
[00:03:21] been training my brain for a really
[00:03:22] really really long time so long I can't
[00:03:25] even remember when I started how's that
[00:03:27] for irony but anybody complain Brain Age
[00:03:30] concentration training to help improve
[00:03:31] their working memory and focus in a fun
[00:03:34] and challenging way and there are a
[00:03:35] whole bunch of other exercises to try in
[00:03:37] the game you can play some of the
[00:03:39] exercises from past Brain Age games or
[00:03:41] give your mind a break with exercises
[00:03:43] from relaxation mode you can play in
[00:03:45] just 5 minutes a day to fit in your busy
[00:03:47] schedule don't forget to track your
[00:03:49] Daily Progress to see if you notice any
[00:03:51] changes in your memory or Focus thanks
[00:03:53] for watching everyone and good luck in
[00:03:55] all your future brain training

[00:00:00] our next guest says he can memorize more
[00:00:02] than 160 names and faces in 15 minutes
[00:00:06] and a deck of cards in just more than a
[00:00:07] minute no wonder why Nelson dallis is a
[00:00:10] two-time USA memory Champion Nelson is
[00:00:13] in town for the AARP life event at 50
[00:00:16] plus conference to talk to people about
[00:00:18] how to keep their memory sharp and he
[00:00:20] has some tips for us good morning how
[00:00:21] you doing good um so we want to start
[00:00:24] off with a little demonstration because
[00:00:26] we want people to you know be able to
[00:00:28] see that you can mean what you're saying
[00:00:30] so I have a deck of cards here and
[00:00:32] you've memorized them how long did you
[00:00:34] look at them um about a minute about a
[00:00:37] minute yeah okay so let's start from the
[00:00:38] beginning what's the first card all
[00:00:39] right so eight of clubs eight of clubs
[00:00:41] got it um 10 of clubs 10 of clubs Ace of
[00:00:43] Hearts Ace of Hearts five of Hearts
[00:00:46] seven of clubs six of Hearts Ace of
[00:00:50] clubs seven of diamonds four of diamonds
[00:00:53] King of Hearts um nine of Hearts four of
[00:00:58] Spades um five of d di okay two of
[00:01:01] Hearts this is unbelievable how did you
[00:01:03] manage to do this in that short of a
[00:01:04] period of time so there are these
[00:01:05] ancient techniques that I learned I
[00:01:07] never had a good memory it's something I
[00:01:09] practiced um where you basically every
[00:01:12] card is a picture of somebody that I
[00:01:14] know something easy to visualize and
[00:01:16] that's the te the main technique is to
[00:01:18] take whatever you memorize and turn it
[00:01:20] into something you can visualize okay
[00:01:22] because a lot of the stuff we deal with
[00:01:23] on a day-to-day basis is abstract uhhuh
[00:01:26] you got to make it meaningful basically
[00:01:28] so you have to convert it into to
[00:01:30] something else yeah so for example King
[00:01:31] of Hearts is my dad because the heart is
[00:01:34] family I guess and king of my family
[00:01:36] would be my dad okay that makes sense
[00:01:38] it's a lot easier to remember that than
[00:01:39] the actual C King and hearts right you
[00:01:42] just get lost in it all I would think
[00:01:44] right exactly yeah um repeat information
[00:01:46] out loud that's another way that you can
[00:01:48] improve your memory right yeah yeah
[00:01:50] that's true um it it helps kind of
[00:01:52] solidify what you've memorized um but
[00:01:55] really the the key thing is to to turn
[00:01:57] it into pictures and to to make it as
[00:01:59] wild and bizarre as possible the more
[00:02:02] outlandish the more you memorize it you
[00:02:03] say create a memory place what do you
[00:02:06] mean by that right so once you have a
[00:02:07] picture for it you need a place to store
[00:02:09] it and um the best way to do that is to
[00:02:11] create your memory Palace um that can be
[00:02:14] any familiar place you know so maybe
[00:02:16] your house you know that very well you
[00:02:18] can walk around it in your mind and
[00:02:20] stick these pictures of whatever you're
[00:02:22] memorizing along a path so you could be
[00:02:24] at your front door you could start there
[00:02:26] and if the first card was King of Hearts
[00:02:28] I would picture my dad standing the
[00:02:30] front door maybe doing something maybe
[00:02:32] he's banging really loud or you know
[00:02:34] he's singing it would take me a a while
[00:02:37] to come up with all that how do you do
[00:02:38] it that quickly that's the practice at
[00:02:40] first it's a slow process but it it's my
[00:02:43] dad and then there's my sister maybe in
[00:02:45] the wait if I turn left you know what I
[00:02:47] mean exactly yeah it it takes a bit of
[00:02:48] practice and it sounds very complicated
[00:02:50] for what I'm trying to do but it's
[00:02:52] actually a better way for our our brains
[00:02:54] to to memorize things does practicing
[00:02:56] really work yes definitely when I
[00:02:58] started I could bar do a deck of cards
[00:03:00] took me 20 minutes to do the first time
[00:03:02] through and now I can do it in perfect
[00:03:05] silence uh in about 30 seconds MH so I
[00:03:08] am always improving with with practice
[00:03:10] there are some things you can do in your
[00:03:11] diet that you say in order to improve
[00:03:13] your memory in order to make it stronger
[00:03:14] what should you do yeah so one thing is
[00:03:16] I practice my memory trips uh T tips
[00:03:19] every day and the other thing is I my
[00:03:20] diet is very important so um there's a
[00:03:23] couple things that you can do like
[00:03:24] eating a lot of antioxidants um
[00:03:26] blueberries spinach broccoli but I also
[00:03:29] take um DHA Omega-3 supplements and I
[00:03:33] specifically take an algae form most
[00:03:35] people take it in fish oil um but if
[00:03:37] you're a vegetarian or you don't like to
[00:03:39] eat a lot of fish um life's DHA which
[00:03:42] there a couple samples right in front of
[00:03:43] me are perfect um alternative okay and
[00:03:45] you want to exercise you want to get
[00:03:47] plenty of sleep exactly exercise is
[00:03:49] great for keeping circulation um at its
[00:03:52] best and you need blood in your brain to
[00:03:54] to be sharp and um sleep definitely yeah
[00:03:58] no stress try to try to get a lot of
[00:04:01] rest well Nelson Dallas thank you so
[00:04:02] much for being with us

=== Speed Cards Demonstration For Washington St.Louis U 2012 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7brKK_c-ng

[00:00:00] yeah yeah that sounds good how how is
[00:00:02] the best way to do theard so the cards
[00:00:04] um basically it's a shuffled deck of
[00:00:06] cards and he'll have um he'll time
[00:00:10] himself see how quickly you want to use
[00:00:12] your timer see how quickly he can get
[00:00:14] through the deck and then um you can
[00:00:17] flip them back over and show everyone
[00:00:20] yeah
[00:00:21] so uh just so I mean I usually in
[00:00:25] practice it's a lot easier when nobody's
[00:00:27] watching you and it's totally quiet I'm
[00:00:29] going to put these on to try and help
[00:00:31] kind of zone out but um I'm going to go
[00:00:34] a lot slower so it might take me like a
[00:00:36] minute and a half um
[00:00:42] but if you can stand a minute and a half
[00:00:44] of
[00:00:53] Silence you can do it too Dave
[00:00:58] you very
[00:01:28] Miss
[00:01:58] for for
[00:02:43] all right so I'm just going to review it

=== Nelson Dellis w/ Wes Moore // "Beyond Belief" segment (2012) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ycE5Ydb3U

[00:00:00] have you ever met a superhuman well if
[00:00:03] you passed the people in tonight's
[00:00:04] episode on the street you might not even
[00:00:07] think twice about them but we believe
[00:00:09] their talent and sheer determination put
[00:00:12] them in a superhuman class first up
[00:00:15] Nelson Dellis has a superhuman brain so
[00:00:19] when most of us can't even remember
[00:00:21] where we put our keys this guy can
[00:00:23] remember 70 names and faces in just 15
[00:00:26] minutes
[00:00:27] he's been crowned the u.s. memory
[00:00:29] champion and he put my memory to the
[00:00:31] task and man was I shocked take a look
[00:00:38] Nelson Dellis can memorize a shuffled
[00:00:41] deck of cards in 38 seconds ace of
[00:00:44] spades 10 of Hearts 5 of spades 344
[00:00:49] random numbers in five minutes one zero
[00:00:52] seven five zero three six three five
[00:00:55] eight nine one one seven and that's just
[00:00:59] a fraction of what this memory Superstar
[00:01:01] can do Nelson Dellis is the 2011 winner
[00:01:08] of the USA memory championship where he
[00:01:11] also broke the u.s. record for
[00:01:13] memorizing numbers and playing cards
[00:01:16] it's never-ending you know you just kind
[00:01:18] of want to see how far you can push push
[00:01:20] the mind we're about to get a glimpse of
[00:01:22] how far he's pushed his four-to-one I'm
[00:01:28] reading off a list of 50 random numbers
[00:01:30] Nelson has never heard before as he
[00:01:33] tries to commit them to memory 8 3 9 all
[00:01:40] right so we have four two one zero seven
[00:01:46] five zero three six three five eight
[00:01:48] nine one one seven seven two seven four
[00:01:50] it's astounding to watch as Nelson calls
[00:01:53] all 15 um eight nine six two zero eight
[00:01:56] three nine and that's why you are the US
[00:02:00] memory champ and then
[00:02:01] and then I have to do this I'm gonna do
[00:02:03] it backwards why not why not
[00:02:05] so nine three and yes females zero one
[00:02:10] two four got it
[00:02:13] that's remarkable okay it seems almost
[00:02:16] superhuman you can do and I can't help
[00:02:18] but wonder you're not some type of
[00:02:21] savant right you don't have this
[00:02:25] off-the-charts IQ you you don't have a
[00:02:29] photographic memory no yeah I mean I I
[00:02:32] don't have any of those things I'm just
[00:02:34] an average guy Nelson insists anyone can
[00:02:37] do what he does with enough training and
[00:02:40] a good imagination and he's made it his
[00:02:43] mission to tell anyone who will listen
[00:02:45] thanks for being out here this is an
[00:02:47] awesome closet up West he concedes has
[00:02:49] become a bit of an obsession after
[00:02:51] losing his grandmother to Alzheimer's
[00:02:53] disease
[00:02:54] so you fear that maybe one day that you
[00:02:56] couldn't have Alzheimer's you never know
[00:02:59] and that's scary that at that age that
[00:03:01] something can happen to you like that
[00:03:02] where your mind just goes he set up a
[00:03:05] charity climb from memory scaling the
[00:03:08] world's highest mountains to raise money
[00:03:10] and awareness for the disease and when
[00:03:18] he's not climbing he's always exercising
[00:03:21] his mind self-taught Nelson uses several
[00:03:25] memory techniques depending on what he's
[00:03:27] trying to remember so let's take my name
[00:03:29] for example sure Wes Moore so Wes I
[00:03:32] think of West I think of like the Wild
[00:03:36] West
[00:03:37] that's just what instantly comes to my
[00:03:38] mind and then more kind of sounds like
[00:03:41] more like maybe he's like extremely
[00:03:44] cowboy like over-the-top like he's got
[00:03:46] he's cowboy he's got over the top Spurs
[00:03:49] chaps
[00:03:50] he's more than he should be right next
[00:03:54] he finds a feature where he can store
[00:03:56] the image and for you I just think of
[00:03:58] your your your head your my dome your
[00:04:01] dumb yeah
[00:04:02] so I would imagine that cowboy kind of
[00:04:04] strolling over your dome so next time I
[00:04:08] see you you know
[00:04:09] look right at your head and then I'll
[00:04:11] think what's more okay but how did he
[00:04:14] memorize all those numbers we gave him
[00:04:16] earlier the answer is he didn't I don't
[00:04:19] see numbers anymore I see people and I
[00:04:22] see actions and objects flying around
[00:04:25] and doing all sorts of silly things he
[00:04:27] turns into a movie take seven five zero
[00:04:31] three seven five is my grandfather and
[00:04:34] zero three is Jack Black and Jack
[00:04:38] Black's action I think of him in that
[00:04:39] movie Nacho Libre he's a wrestler so I
[00:04:44] think my grandfather wrestling and he's
[00:04:47] like rolling around on the floor 72 74
[00:04:50] creates a very different image that's
[00:04:53] George Bush 72 the ex-president 74 is
[00:04:57] Gerard Depardieu though as a musketeer
[00:05:00] so is actually a sword fighting and so I
[00:05:03] pictured George Bush sword fighting you
[00:05:05] know and he's wearing his presidential
[00:05:07] attire and he's got a fencing sword next
[00:05:09] to remember the order of the numbers he
[00:05:12] creates something called a memory palace
[00:05:15] a place that I know in my mind that I
[00:05:17] can walk through without thinking about
[00:05:19] it that I've been to this could be like
[00:05:21] your childhood home your work place for
[00:05:25] our numbers challenge he chose a
[00:05:26] favorite hotel placing the first set of
[00:05:29] numbers his wrestling grandfather in the
[00:05:32] lobby
[00:05:32] the next George Bush fencing on a
[00:05:36] staircase leading to the second floor
[00:05:38] and then to recall it all I'm doing is
[00:05:41] just walking mentally through that place
[00:05:42] and seeing the images that I stuck there
[00:05:44] and you say that anybody can do this
[00:05:47] totally yeah and in fact this afternoon
[00:05:49] we'll have you memorize something you
[00:05:51] don't know what it is memorize it yes
[00:05:53] Nelson I'm nervous man he's about to
[00:05:57] give me a blockbuster of a challenge
[00:05:59] when we meet at biscaia a national
[00:06:02] landmark in miami who do you think won
[00:06:06] the Best Picture Oscar in 1988 no idea
[00:06:10] what about 1976 I don't know can you
[00:06:13] name any movie that won Best Picture
[00:06:16] then milk win one year milk didn't win
[00:06:18] did the rest of one no no did glory win
[00:06:22] Lori never want know I'm beginning to
[00:06:25] see where this is probably headed and
[00:06:27] Nelson's about to prove me right we're
[00:06:30] actually gonna take you through here and
[00:06:31] have you memorize all of the movies that
[00:06:34] won best picture for the Oscars since
[00:06:36] 1928 since 1928 yeah so that's 83 movies
[00:06:41] seriously he has got to be kidding
[00:06:44] 83 movies I tell you Nelson you have
[00:06:47] picked a very daunting task for yourself
[00:06:49] so correct good luck all right biscaia
[00:06:52] will be my memory palace I'll learn the
[00:06:55] movies decade by decade using objects
[00:06:58] throughout the estate to help me recall
[00:07:00] each film for the 1930 Oscar winner All
[00:07:04] Quiet on the Western Front it's a face
[00:07:07] on a fountain so what I imagined was
[00:07:10] just just saying okay quiet that should
[00:07:13] be enough All Quiet on the Western
[00:07:14] French quiet
[00:07:16] next up the 1931 Western Cimarron we
[00:07:21] decide the name kind of sounds like
[00:07:22] similar and come up with a crazy image
[00:07:25] of a pot simmering on a bush okay so now
[00:07:30] we're gonna do the next year which was
[00:07:31] 1932 before I know it we've sailed
[00:07:34] through the decade and reached the 1948
[00:07:37] classic Hamlet we imagine a ham lying on
[00:07:41] a bench and maybe you're deciding
[00:07:43] whether to or to not pick it up so I'm
[00:07:47] going like to be or not to be kind of
[00:07:49] thing to pick it up or not to pick it up
[00:07:51] you don't know that piece of ham is just
[00:07:53] sitting there I like that okay this is
[00:07:56] definitely fun but I'm seriously
[00:07:58] wondering how I'm ever going to learn 83
[00:08:01] films in an afternoon coming up some
[00:08:06] oscar-winning moments I'd rather forget
[00:08:11] don't nai and I give this
[00:08:15] seventeen-year-old a memory challenge of
[00:08:17] my own 100 words in 15 minutes can she
[00:08:22] do it
[00:08:29] when Nelson Dellis won the 2011 USA
[00:08:32] memory championship he faced tough
[00:08:35] competition
[00:08:36] Farber clubs from some unlikely
[00:08:38] challengers third card is King of Hearts
[00:08:42] that's high school senior Michael glance
[00:08:45] and seventeen-year-old Sophia hue
[00:08:48] battling it out for the top spot members
[00:08:56] of the Hershey Pennsylvania High School
[00:08:58] in memory team one of only a handful
[00:09:00] nationwide ready on Thursday afternoons
[00:09:04] you can find the team studying playing
[00:09:07] horns and numbers and words then
[00:09:10] recalling them one by one
[00:09:12] magic Sophia not only made it to the
[00:09:15] championship finals she also broke the
[00:09:17] national record for memorizing words 120
[00:09:22] in 15 minutes I think he's one of my
[00:09:25] best experiences in my life hearing
[00:09:28] impaired she hears with the help of a
[00:09:30] cochlear implant when you first started
[00:09:32] around how many words could you remember
[00:09:34] about for what you wrote it was not
[00:09:37] really good how did you go from 40 words
[00:09:39] to 120 words breaking the national
[00:09:43] record practice I knew activity go void
[00:09:49] hoping to get a glimpse of this memory
[00:09:51] champion action we gave Sophia 15
[00:09:54] minutes to memorize in order 100 words
[00:09:57] she's never seen before
[00:09:59] a CIT teacher practice capital time
[00:10:05] pressure it's amazing to see her clip
[00:10:10] through all 100 words with barely a
[00:10:13] pause silicon nano tank are two minutes
[00:10:17] later she's done this is how you did
[00:10:21] well had to push the perfect 100% think
[00:10:26] while Sophia is the word champ
[00:10:29] Michael glance is the team's poetry
[00:10:32] master and an unlikely one at that
[00:10:36] you're a powerlifter yeah you're a
[00:10:38] football player yeah and you're also a
[00:10:40] poetry memory champ I know they don't
[00:10:42] really go together but it works works is
[00:10:45] putting it mildly
[00:10:49] in 2011 Michael grabbed the national
[00:10:53] title from memorizing poetry that's you
[00:10:56] are fair or wise is vain comma or strong
[00:10:59] comma especially impressive for someone
[00:11:02] who ended up a poetry champ almost by
[00:11:05] accident I was really into football and
[00:11:07] my grades started to slip and I thought
[00:11:09] hey maybe the memory team will help me
[00:11:11] advance my studies and I turned out to
[00:11:14] be pretty good at the poetry his grades
[00:11:16] improved too from B's and C's to A's at
[00:11:20] this point I'd be happy to squeak by
[00:11:23] with just a passing grade on my own
[00:11:25] quest to memorize 83 oscar-winning
[00:11:27] movies in an afternoon
[00:11:30] amethyst kiyah a national landmark in
[00:11:33] Miami where Nelson has been teaching me
[00:11:35] the film's decade by decade using
[00:11:37] objects throughout the estate 1970s
[00:11:41] gonna start on this bush we're halfway
[00:11:43] there and I finally start to get the
[00:11:46] hang of it when we reach the 1971 film
[00:11:49] the French Connection and this is gonna
[00:11:51] sound really odd okay but I'm actually
[00:11:53] thinking that this actually looked like
[00:11:54] french fries okay come here
[00:11:56] so they're all kind of like connection
[00:11:59] hence the French Connection okay good
[00:12:01] for the Oscar winner One Flew Over the
[00:12:03] Cuckoo's Nest I can't help but think of
[00:12:05] Jack Nicholson but when I'm thinking
[00:12:08] about Jack Nicholson I'm thinking of the
[00:12:09] shining oh yeah and I almost feel like
[00:12:12] as I'm looking at it I see five Jack
[00:12:15] Nicholson's pier up and say like here's
[00:12:17] Johnny
[00:12:18] the five heads will help me remember the
[00:12:20] year 1975 all right so now we're gonna
[00:12:25] do the 1980s before I know it we soared
[00:12:28] through the 1980s and reached the 1998
[00:12:32] film Shakespeare in Love we picture
[00:12:34] Shakespeare canoodling with a lady
[00:12:37] friend in love go get our own
[00:12:39] Shakespeare for the Oscar winner
[00:12:41] American Beauty all either of us can
[00:12:44] imagine
[00:12:45] rose petals Foley beautiful forgot one
[00:12:48] more decade all right cool
[00:12:50] as we hit the final decade we're
[00:12:53] overlooking a perfect setting for the
[00:12:55] 2001 Oscar winner a beautiful mind I
[00:12:58] just think a beautiful brain sandwiched
[00:13:01] in between those two pillars
[00:13:03] it's a beautiful scene and there's a
[00:13:04] mind a scene that will also help me
[00:13:07] remember the 2004 film Million Dollar
[00:13:10] Baby but I have a friend who says baby
[00:13:13] to everything he would say this a
[00:13:15] million dollar view baby for sure that's
[00:13:18] awesome for The King's Speech we picture
[00:13:21] Colin Firth up there in the distance we
[00:13:26] just went through eight decades of
[00:13:27] movies yeah we did now we got a we got a
[00:13:31] test Siri how to test you on it when we
[00:13:33] started out I couldn't even name one
[00:13:35] Oscar winner so at this point I'd be
[00:13:39] happy not to embarrass myself I'm seeing
[00:13:42] the man talking I'm asking to be quiet
[00:13:44] it's All Quiet on the Western Front and
[00:13:45] then I'm seeing the either the leaves
[00:13:47] and that's Cimarron good I'm shocked
[00:13:49] when I make it to 1951 without
[00:13:51] forgetting one film but even when I
[00:13:54] stumble it takes only a small reminder
[00:13:56] there's just above it there was a stuff
[00:13:59] I'm seeing I guess it's oh it's a woman
[00:14:00] it's a woman with the Eiffel Tower in
[00:14:02] her head American in Paris back on track
[00:14:05] I sweep through the next five decades
[00:14:07] and to the finish after The Hurt Locker
[00:14:10] we look up we look at the King giving
[00:14:12] the speech and that is the King's Speech
[00:14:15] very good you got us I got it but then
[00:14:19] not everyone gets to learn from a memory
[00:14:22] champion by the way a few weeks after I
[00:14:25] met Nelson my sister asked me if I still
[00:14:28] remember it all eighty-three
[00:14:29] oscar-winning movies and using the
[00:14:31] techniques Nelson taught me I actually
[00:14:33] still recall most of them

=== Nelson Dellis Teaching Bill Weir How To Memorize A Deck Of Cards ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcVmg5_qKlE

[00:00:00] All right. So, I'm going to teach you
[00:00:01] how to memorize a deck of cards. Um, to
[00:00:04] start though, I'm going to kind of All I
[00:00:06] have are the face cards. Okay. Okay.
[00:00:07] These are the Jack, Queen, King. Sure.
[00:00:09] of each suit. So, 12 cards. All right.
[00:00:11] Most people, if I give them five cards,
[00:00:14] and I'm just going to give you five face
[00:00:15] cards, can't remember them. Okay. You
[00:00:18] may remember some, but you'll forget the
[00:00:20] suit or the the name of the card. So, I
[00:00:23] literally have three neurons floating in
[00:00:25] Heineken. So, I can remember two cards
[00:00:28] in a row. Okay, let's try. The goal is
[00:00:31] to make you fail. So, okay.
[00:00:34] Uh, Jack of Spades.
[00:00:38] Yep. Um, Jack of Clubs.
[00:00:42] Nope.
[00:00:45] And I'm done at two.
[00:00:48] After that one, maybe there was king of
[00:00:49] spades. Mm- Wow. I suck. Queen of
[00:00:53] spades. Queen of spades. So, what we're
[00:00:55] going to do is come up with we're going
[00:00:56] to put the suits all together and we're
[00:00:58] going to have you come up with your own
[00:01:00] images. All right. So, let's start with
[00:01:02] the hearts. The hearts are the easiest
[00:01:04] because I think you should just go for
[00:01:06] your family. Closest to your heart,
[00:01:08] right? King of hearts could be your
[00:01:09] father. Let's do that because he's the
[00:01:10] king of your family. Queen of hearts
[00:01:12] could be your mother. Do you have any
[00:01:14] siblings? I do. What do you have? Uh,
[00:01:16] brother. Okay. So, he'll be the jack.
[00:01:18] Okay. Okay. Of the family. Um, all
[00:01:21] right. So now that we have the images,
[00:01:24] now we need to give him an action and an
[00:01:25] object. So when you think of your dad,
[00:01:27] what do you think of? I think of him uh
[00:01:29] on a horse. On a horse. Okay. So that's
[00:01:32] his action. And maybe his object could
[00:01:34] be a horse. Okay. Okay. Because that's
[00:01:36] related. What about Queen of Hearts? Uh
[00:01:38] I think of my mom reading the Bible.
[00:01:41] Okay. And your brother? Uh getting a lap
[00:01:43] dance.
[00:01:45] Nice. And his
[00:01:46] object could either be money or a
[00:01:49] stripper, I guess. Right. Go choose one.
[00:01:51] I guess the stripper will be a little
[00:01:52] bit fun. Yeah, we'll go with the
[00:01:53] stripper. Okay, so those are
[00:01:54] disappointing. Obviously, the queen of
[00:01:56] hearts and her Bible. Yeah. Okay. So,
[00:01:59] let's go to diamonds. So, because it's
[00:02:01] diamonds, let's think of really rich
[00:02:03] people. Who's the richest person comes
[00:02:06] to your mind? Actually, you know, the
[00:02:07] first one popping into my mind was
[00:02:08] Bernard Maidoff. Okay, fair enough. U
[00:02:12] that's what you should go for. The
[00:02:13] things that instantly pop out of your
[00:02:14] mind. Instantly pop. Yeah, it's it's ill
[00:02:16] ill gotten gains, but Yeah. All right.
[00:02:18] Right. Doesn't matter. Okay. So, maid
[00:02:20] off, what's his action? Uh, he is uh uh
[00:02:25] making license plates. Okay. So, a quick
[00:02:29] uh
[00:02:30] recap. King of hearts was dad riding a
[00:02:33] horse. Yeah. Mom reading the Bible.
[00:02:36] Yeah. Brother Josh getting a lap dance
[00:02:38] from a stripper. Okay. Yeah. Uh Bernard
[00:02:41] Maidoff making license plates. Oprah
[00:02:44] Winfrey giving me a Ford Festiva.
[00:02:47] uh and Jay-Z on a fantastic motorboat in
[00:02:51] off of San Andre. So now I shuffle the
[00:02:54] cards, okay? And for every three cards,
[00:02:57] we're going to put them down and make a
[00:02:59] little story. So the first card that we
[00:03:01] see in that sequence is going to be the
[00:03:03] person. You're going to take the person
[00:03:04] that's associated with that card. The
[00:03:06] second card will be also a person, but
[00:03:09] you're going to use the action of that
[00:03:11] person. Then the third card will be
[00:03:12] we'll use that object. I see. And then
[00:03:14] we put them together into one like it's
[00:03:17] almost like clue the game clue where you
[00:03:19] say that person is doing this with this
[00:03:21] object. Got it. And we're going to stick
[00:03:23] that in a room. Uh and this could be
[00:03:26] let's let's do it in this office. Um we
[00:03:30] we only have 12 cards. So we're going to
[00:03:32] need four kind of anchor points. Okay.
[00:03:34] So the first one could be this table.
[00:03:36] All right. The next could be this
[00:03:38] jacket. Then maybe that helmet up there.
[00:03:40] All right. And then maybe that bottom
[00:03:43] shelf. Okay. Okay. So, we have one a
[00:03:46] little journey, a little memory palace
[00:03:48] here. One, two, three, four. Okay. All
[00:03:49] right. So, let's go with
[00:03:53] um queen of spades. Yeah.
[00:04:00] Uh king of diamonds. Yep. And then we go
[00:04:04] up here and it's
[00:04:05] um uh king of hearts. Yep.
[00:04:11] Uh queen of clubs. Queen of clubs. Uh,
[00:04:15] Queen of Hearts. Queen of Hearts. The
[00:04:17] Bible. Yep. Then we've got Jack of
[00:04:20] Hearts. Yeah.
[00:04:23] Um, Jack of Clubs. Yeah.
[00:04:28] King of Spades.
[00:04:31] Yep.
[00:04:33] We got uh, Jack of Diamonds. Yep.
[00:04:42] Um, queen of diamonds
[00:04:46] and king of clubs. King of clubs. There
[00:04:49] you go. Look at that. Pretty cool,
[00:04:51] right?
[00:04:52] You just changed my life. There you go.
[00:04:55] Can't remember your name, though.

[00:00:00] in the age of Google and Siri chances
[00:00:02] are you can't remember your boss's phone
[00:00:04] number or your sister's address or the
[00:00:06] capital of anywhere but if I asked you
[00:00:08] to imagine Kim Kardashian in a fondue
[00:00:11] hot tub with the doy Lama that might
[00:00:13] stick and that is something every
[00:00:16] contestant at tomorrow's national memory
[00:00:18] Championship understands the defending
[00:00:20] champ dropped by yesterday and blew my
[00:00:23] mind both with what he can do and what
[00:00:25] he can teach
[00:00:27] you they say dogs have a short-term
[00:00:30] memory of about 20 seconds honestly mine
[00:00:33] is worse Jack of Spades yep Jack of
[00:00:38] clubs
[00:00:41] nope and I'm done it too it is all the
[00:00:44] more humiliating because the guy sitting
[00:00:46] next to me can memorize the order of an
[00:00:48] entire deck of cards in 63 seconds just
[00:00:51] one of the skills that makes Nelson
[00:00:53] dallis the reigning National memory
[00:00:55] champion
[00:01:01] and here's the most amazing part there
[00:01:03] is nothing extraordinary about his brain
[00:01:06] ten clubs AC Spades three of Spades six
[00:01:10] of diamonds do you have a photographic
[00:01:13] memory naturally no so my memory is just
[00:01:16] average it all began when his
[00:01:18] grandmother got Alzheimer's and then he
[00:01:21] got scared I was really kind of
[00:01:23] concerned for myself and and what that
[00:01:25] might mean for me in the future so in
[00:01:27] searching for mental drills on the
[00:01:28] internet he stumbled into into the world
[00:01:30] of memory competition mental athletes
[00:01:32] you may begin and realize that all of
[00:01:34] these Elite mental athletes are also
[00:01:37] ordinary people with ordinary brains but
[00:01:39] they've all learned an ancient but
[00:01:41] amazingly simple technique 02 694 and
[00:01:45] once you have it down he says that you
[00:01:47] too might be able to memorize the ZIP
[00:01:48] codes of a few dozen complete strangers
[00:01:51] in Time Square how about uh lightning
[00:01:53] bolt this guy 0
[00:01:56] 2694 this was 06878
[00:02:00] she was
[00:02:02] 07928
[00:02:04] 02719 give him a
[00:02:07] hand I remember that the blonde is from
[00:02:10] Denmark is that right yes the key is to
[00:02:14] associate Vivid mental images with
[00:02:17] mundane names or numbers the more
[00:02:19] bizarre the better uh so my name is Bill
[00:02:22] Weir uh my zip code is 17 how would you
[00:02:26] lock that in I would come up with an
[00:02:27] image for the number okay so one
[00:02:30] to me is
[00:02:32] Frankenstein and 07 is is James Bond so
[00:02:36] I picture Frankenstein sipping a martini
[00:02:39] and how do you associate that with I
[00:02:41] would stick that on you have very you
[00:02:43] know news anchor hair oh perfect so it's
[00:02:47] nothing bad you know but that's that's
[00:02:48] just what I would be drawn to you know
[00:02:50] so I would picture Frankenstein kind of
[00:02:53] inside of your your wave there sipping a
[00:02:55] martini glass that's just the first part
[00:02:58] now to understand how he remembers
[00:02:59] things in sequence we strolled over to
[00:03:01] my favorite Market I'm asked Nelson to
[00:03:04] memorize the precise order of one of the
[00:03:07] better beer selections on the upper west
[00:03:10] side of Manhattan after staring intently
[00:03:12] at the order of about 50 different
[00:03:14] brands we throw a blindfold on them and
[00:03:17] another pilsner Orel right um another
[00:03:20] River horse another renberger another
[00:03:23] Goose Island Guinness draft a flying dog
[00:03:27] is it a Blue Moon yes okay the trick is
[00:03:30] to assign an image to each brand so for
[00:03:33] Modello Especial he pictures a special
[00:03:36] sexy model how about the Dirty Bastard
[00:03:39] Ale I just thought of the the rapper Old
[00:03:41] Dirty Bastard okay he then places these
[00:03:44] images along a specific path and a
[00:03:46] so-called Memory Palace I was actually
[00:03:48] using my high school back in Miami and I
[00:03:51] was walking through it putting all these
[00:03:53] images along a specific path
[00:03:56] congratulations but here's where the
[00:03:58] story goes beyond party tricks two weeks
[00:04:01] after the memory championship and in
[00:04:03] honor of his late grandmother this Avid
[00:04:06] climber set out to conquer Mount Everest
[00:04:08] the Everest is behind there acclimating
[00:04:10] in base camp for over a month he was
[00:04:12] able to focus on his memory workouts
[00:04:14] like never before and despite the low
[00:04:16] oxygen the results amazed him my times
[00:04:20] for memorizing a deck of cards went
[00:04:23] through the roof since all those numbers
[00:04:24] and cards represent these images of of
[00:04:27] people I know having to think of those
[00:04:29] places places so many thousands of miles
[00:04:31] from home and having been away for so
[00:04:33] long that they just were so intense and
[00:04:37] after he climbed past the body of a
[00:04:39] fallen Mountaineer into the death zone
[00:04:41] when his oxygen mask froze 300 ft from
[00:04:44] the summon and his body wouldn't go on
[00:04:47] he says those intense memories kept him
[00:04:49] alive I could feel like I was in the
[00:04:51] living room back home in Miami where I'm
[00:04:54] from with my family and I could feel the
[00:04:57] warmth you know smell my mom's cooking
[00:04:59] and it was just like I was there it woke
[00:05:02] me up and told me to get back down you
[00:05:04] know it's a shame that people who
[00:05:07] developed alimer lose those memories and
[00:05:10] if there's anything you can do like you
[00:05:12] know make your mind stronger your memory
[00:05:15] stronger then people should be doing
[00:05:18] that King of Hearts was Dad riding a
[00:05:20] horse so point taken let's get back to
[00:05:23] dog brain brother Josh getting a lap
[00:05:25] dance from a stripper okay yeah uh
[00:05:28] Bernard m making license plates Oprah
[00:05:31] Winfrey giving me a Ford Festiva just a
[00:05:34] few minutes after turning the face cards
[00:05:36] into people and building a Memory Palace
[00:05:38] out of my office
[00:05:41] behold King of Hearts yep Queen of Clubs

[00:00:01] zero three seven nine five three four
[00:00:08] five zero when I tell people about what
[00:00:12] I do
[00:00:13] I get such a big shock oh you must be
[00:00:19] some savant or something like that and
[00:00:21] that's not the case it's just a
[00:00:22] technique that's kind of died out
[00:00:24] because the need is not there I'm Nelson
[00:00:29] Dellis on the 2011 USA memory champion
[00:00:32] and I memorize things as profession one
[00:00:36] thing that that kind of pushed me along
[00:00:38] this path is my grandmother who had been
[00:00:40] suffering from Alzheimer's disease and
[00:00:42] that's part of the reason why I was so
[00:00:44] concerned for myself and why I got into
[00:00:46] all of this memory training is because I
[00:00:48] didn't want that to happen to me
[00:00:50] you know I saw what it was doing to her
[00:00:52] and what it was doing to our family
[00:00:54] it's tough to deal with one of the
[00:01:00] events I trained is is spoken numbers so
[00:01:02] I'm closing my eyes I'm hearing these
[00:01:04] numbers come at me one digit at a second
[00:01:06] and what I do is I'm turning those into
[00:01:09] pictures I receive a few digits at a
[00:01:11] time and I turn that into a picture and
[00:01:13] then receive another two and kind of
[00:01:15] make a little story and store that along
[00:01:18] a place when I'm writing it down all I'm
[00:01:20] doing is walking back through that place
[00:01:23] picturing who was there and then
[00:01:25] translating that back to the numbers
[00:01:27] that those pictures represent I can't
[00:01:30] help it anymore I look at these numbers
[00:01:31] and they are people to mean when I see
[00:01:34] three zero its Conan O'Brien same with
[00:01:37] my grandmother she's 175 that's her
[00:01:40] number so when she pops up it's awesome
[00:01:45] any distraction can be detrimental to
[00:01:48] you know an event that you're trying to
[00:01:51] get a good score on so we try to
[00:01:53] minimize those distractions you know go
[00:01:55] to a public place and train or you know
[00:01:58] I'll train a high altitude in the
[00:02:00] mountains my first kind of big
[00:02:03] fundraising project was to climb Mount
[00:02:05] Everest and I thought it would be a
[00:02:06] great way to kind of bring House members
[00:02:09] to the top of the world for the
[00:02:13] competition I actually trained about
[00:02:15] four to five hours a day it's because
[00:02:18] I'm trying actively hard to win these
[00:02:20] competitions I train my brain in the
[00:02:23] same sense that you know you go to the
[00:02:24] gym or to make your body stronger I do
[00:02:27] that from my mind to try and develop
[00:02:29] that memory and make it stronger what's
[00:02:32] scary to me the most about potentially
[00:02:35] losing memories is not you know
[00:02:39] forgetting you know all the stuff I
[00:02:42] learned in college or you know the fact
[00:02:45] that I was the memory champion whatever
[00:02:47] it's it's it's more those small moments
[00:02:49] you know with the people you love and
[00:02:52] and care about that makes us who we are
[00:02:54] and if you lose those memories and those
[00:02:57] feelings that came along with it then
[00:02:59] who are you and how can you enjoy life

=== Learn to play "Hallelujah, I Love Her So" by Jerry Reed (Part 2) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0Nm2_V6rNw

[00:00:24] alright this is how the Oliver so buy
[00:00:26] your read kind of the verse and guess
[00:00:30] yeah she's the first so I was a bit
[00:00:33] sloppy but whatever the point is to
[00:00:34] teach you not to play perfect same thing
[00:00:37] you can ask me for tabs I'll send you
[00:00:39] this part to it and let's go it's a bit
[00:00:43] it's a cool cool groove kind of tricky
[00:00:46] to get down if you're not used to this
[00:00:48] kind of stuff but definitely learn about
[00:00:51] so let's go with the first chord if you
[00:00:55] watch my previous video it's that same
[00:00:57] one barring the F or the first fret okay
[00:01:01] but with that two down on the sorry
[00:01:05] third string so and you're playing the
[00:01:09] bass this one so those are the only four
[00:01:21] notes you're playing and the way you
[00:01:23] want to do it is approach it with a
[00:01:25] thumb you don't have to have a pick or
[00:01:26] not but it helps play the bass and then
[00:01:30] kind of pick them up with these three
[00:01:33] fingers those three it kind of slaps
[00:01:43] that the strings in between so what you
[00:01:46] want to do is kind of practice that feel
[00:01:48] of going face slap slap bass slap and
[00:01:59] that gives the groove for the whole
[00:02:01] thing
[00:02:08] right okay so you can get that down then
[00:02:12] you've you can pretty much play that
[00:02:13] pretty sexy but anyways let me teach you
[00:02:18] the rest of the court so that's the
[00:02:19] first one okay then the next one is this
[00:02:24] one so that's an open D and you're here
[00:02:31] on the third fret fifth fret and 4th
[00:02:38] fret down there so it's the same concept
[00:02:41] you're always playing a bass and then
[00:02:43] pulling with your other fingers kind of
[00:02:46] climbing that three notes so we go
[00:03:04] alright then the next one so again we're
[00:03:09] barring the first fret but this time we
[00:03:11] have a finger down a third fret here and
[00:03:14] the third fret here so we're playing the
[00:03:21] middle one is barred already over here
[00:03:22] so it's just the bases on the a string
[00:03:25] first fret and that's tricky it goes
[00:03:41] in between before the next chord okay so
[00:03:49] we go so then I kind of play they're all
[00:03:59] on the third fret here and then that's
[00:04:06] that first chord but we hammer on that
[00:04:08] to kind of like we did in the first
[00:04:10] video so you go from that second last
[00:04:15] forward okay and I continue so that's
[00:04:23] the first part so let's go through that
[00:04:25] slow okay so that's tough to get and
[00:04:46] that I mean you're not playing the
[00:04:47] course for very long so you got to learn
[00:04:48] how to jump quickly from the other one
[00:04:50] to the other and that you get in the
[00:04:52] muscle memory that pretty quick if you
[00:04:53] practice a lot so he plays that I think
[00:04:57] twice through and then once he gets back
[00:04:59] to there he stops kind of abruptly so
[00:05:09] right the next chord is basically the
[00:05:13] second one I told you about
[00:05:15] but you hammer on this thing okay so
[00:05:22] it's and I tap this just for a bit of a
[00:05:27] groove but you can just count that out
[00:05:29] if you want but it helps because that
[00:05:36] kind of is shorter so I type it twice so
[00:05:41] those two chords open D I'm sorry open a
[00:05:50] fifth fret sixth fret six right as I
[00:05:56] played all four notes at the same time
[00:06:01] okay that's similar to that f bar with
[00:06:04] that finger down there just the sixth
[00:06:08] fret okay and then we slide back down
[00:06:13] here and this is a bit of a tricky chord
[00:06:15] kind of ugly to sounding by itself
[00:06:19] alright so 2nd fret here and then you
[00:06:23] can bar that 1st fret on the bottom and
[00:06:25] just put your pinkie here on the 3rd
[00:06:27] fret there's three notes plus that base
[00:06:31] now slide this don't even move just
[00:06:34] slide it to the so your base is on the
[00:06:37] fifth fret down the 8th fret ok and then
[00:06:48] the next part goes so we go sorry ok so
[00:07:00] this is again that F but now it's not
[00:07:02] it's you add this on the third fret
[00:07:06] fourth string open ok and then these
[00:07:27] last three chords kind of go in
[00:07:29] succession so that's a d basically and
[00:07:41] you can keep that position here with
[00:07:42] these guys
[00:07:43] and just put your bass so move it from
[00:07:45] here to this
[00:07:57] so that's just first right here and then
[00:08:01] those three and then now we play that
[00:08:11] like before you can learn that live from
[00:08:23] the last video Sam but it leads in with
[00:08:38] and yeah you go meta repeats over again
[00:08:45] so quickly shares hope that helped a
[00:09:31] little bit I'll be adding more later on
[00:09:33] but those should get you started
[00:09:34] don't forget to email me about the tabs
[00:09:37] we'll send a mouth piece give me your
[00:09:38] email
[00:09:38] don't forget your email


=== Learn to play "Hallelujah, I Love Her So" by Jerry Reed (Part 1) REDO ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3_bp5pKiSY

[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:21] all right so I'm going to do another
[00:00:22] video I got a lot of complaints about
[00:00:24] the last one too dark shitty sound and
[00:00:27] maybe not so obvious what I was doing so
[00:00:31] I'm going to if you email me I'll send
[00:00:33] you tabs of what I'm doing uh so that'll
[00:00:36] help but I feel like the best way to
[00:00:38] teach it is to kind of just play it
[00:00:40] slowly and repeat it uh certain sections
[00:00:43] over and over instead of so we start
[00:00:45] with the open a
[00:00:48] [Music]
[00:01:11] so you stay this is almost this is an F
[00:01:14] chord so if you stay uh with these uh
[00:01:17] this kind of bottom
[00:01:20] part you keep that
[00:01:23] position after you
[00:01:24] [Music]
[00:01:28] go and you kind of pull off this third
[00:01:31] [Music]
[00:01:34] fret
[00:01:35] [Music]
[00:01:43] sorry that's already there that's this
[00:01:45] [Music]
[00:01:46] one another pull
[00:01:50] [Music]
[00:01:53] off you can play it a pull off or not so
[00:02:05] [Music]
[00:02:09] okay so it's keep that chord position
[00:02:13] still there but you add
[00:02:16] this
[00:02:18] so and then add your pinky just under it
[00:02:22] and take it
[00:02:24] off okay and that's the first kind of
[00:02:27] phrase you repeat that over three times
[00:02:29] so
[00:02:30] [Music]
[00:02:41] so okay uh and then this last time is a
[00:02:45] bit
[00:02:48] different so that's the
[00:02:53] same
[00:02:56] sorry so that same chord again
[00:03:00] but you play an open
[00:03:02] D in
[00:03:06] between so that second chord you're
[00:03:08] playing
[00:03:09] [Music]
[00:03:17] is
[00:03:18] [Music]
[00:03:20] sorry you can just kind of shift back
[00:03:23] and forth
[00:03:24] [Music]
[00:03:27] there so again that chord
[00:03:31] is
[00:03:33] sorry and then the open
[00:03:38] E
[00:03:40] so if you can just practice going back
[00:03:43] and forth but playing an open D in the
[00:03:44] middle of
[00:03:48] them okay
[00:03:54] so cool right so the beginning we have
[00:03:58] those four measures
[00:04:03] [Music]
[00:04:15] okay
[00:04:21] sorry all right so
[00:04:23] now hang on one second
[00:04:30] all right so here it's a bit tricky
[00:04:32] because we're playing some baseline and
[00:04:35] some Melody on top of it so the Basse
[00:04:42] goes
[00:04:48] okay so don't even learn that just
[00:04:50] that's how it should sound because it
[00:04:51] makes more sense when you play them
[00:04:52] together the high part will
[00:04:54] [Music]
[00:04:58] go so
[00:05:00] sorry so together you play the three
[00:05:05] third fret on the E string and the high
[00:05:08] uh fourth fret on the high E string
[00:05:11] so but it's it's syncopated a little bit
[00:05:14] so
[00:05:14] [Music]
[00:05:18] it's uh that's down to the third fret
[00:05:20] here and then an open
[00:05:23] a so uh first fret on the a string and
[00:05:28] first fret on the E string
[00:05:33] okay that's two here three
[00:05:36] here and then this chord which is just
[00:05:41] third fret on the second string there uh
[00:05:44] sorry on the fifth string um and then
[00:05:46] this chord on the bottom so
[00:05:49] three three and
[00:05:53] one with that base on the a
[00:05:57] string but you can't you don't go
[00:06:00] throughout the song he kind of does
[00:06:03] that but in this beginning part he
[00:06:07] goes
[00:06:09] sorry so he does that whole chord plays
[00:06:13] the Basse and then sticks his pinky on
[00:06:15] the high third fret uh High fret third
[00:06:18] string High string third fret
[00:06:24] sorry and that last chord is uh just
[00:06:27] barring the whole uh first fret
[00:06:30] and playing only three of the strings
[00:06:33] the uh sixth
[00:06:36] string the high string and then the
[00:06:39] fourth string but that gets hammered on
[00:06:42] to the second fret so you
[00:06:45] go okay so to play a little run again it
[00:06:50] [Music]
[00:06:55] goes okay one more time
[00:07:05] okay then we slide up to this little
[00:07:07] Blues
[00:07:12] run boom so there we slide up to the
[00:07:16] fifth fret bar it and you
[00:07:21] play okay
[00:07:24] so that's this note and then the high
[00:07:28] fifth fret on the E
[00:07:31] string and you as you play those you can
[00:07:34] kind of lay down that sixth fret here
[00:07:37] and the seventh fret here
[00:07:41] so and a bit of a stretch with your
[00:07:43] pinky to the ninth fret here on the uh
[00:07:47] fourth
[00:07:51] string okay so that you're playing that
[00:07:54] one and this one at the same time but
[00:07:57] you've barred that so it's just playing
[00:07:59] that
[00:08:02] uh
[00:08:06] sorry and that seven is still attached
[00:08:10] don't lift
[00:08:11] [Music]
[00:08:14] it
[00:08:16] [Music]
[00:08:26] okay and then bar that eighth fret and
[00:08:29] play
[00:08:33] those
[00:08:34] two and then back to that bar F and
[00:08:37] hammer on the
[00:08:38] [Music]
[00:08:45] two okay super
[00:08:48] [Music]
[00:08:56] slow okay and then that slides up to the
[00:08:59] seventh
[00:09:00] fret same position but you add this
[00:09:03] eighth on the
[00:09:08] bottom then you slide up to the eighth
[00:09:10] fret and play that same chord position
[00:09:13] as on the F so you're
[00:09:15] playing add that high eighth
[00:09:18] here but then the same on the eighth
[00:09:20] fret boom so that's pretty much it let's
[00:09:24] do it all over one more time
[00:09:26] [Music]
[00:09:50] all right I hope that helped um I'll
[00:09:52] come up with more of the song uh I'll
[00:09:54] actually post those videos coming up
[00:09:56] soon peace see you


=== Unofficial new USA speed cards record - 53 seconds! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9RfBhNKnas

[00:00:00] we are going to have what we believe
[00:00:02] will be a United States record for
[00:00:04] memory
[00:00:04] this is Jane Alvarez and she is
[00:00:06] shuffling these cards she will give me
[00:00:09] these cards and over here is Nelson
[00:00:12] Dellis he has a memory expert he is
[00:00:15] world-renowned and he has a timer right
[00:00:18] here and Nelson tell us what you will do
[00:00:20] so I'm gonna memorize this deck of cards
[00:00:22] in hopefully under 63 seconds which is
[00:00:24] the current u.s. record for memorizing a
[00:00:26] deck of cards and we have the timer
[00:00:28] right here and when you're ready you
[00:00:30] will hit it you know you were done you
[00:00:32] will stop it yes
[00:01:38] unbelievable
[00:01:42] can any moment just to review
[00:02:36] okay 53 seconds unbelievable world
[00:02:41] record ministry so now I'm going to
[00:02:44] refresh this and then this this deck of
[00:02:47] cards is in a standard order that a new
[00:02:50] deck of cards come in so I'm gonna put
[00:02:52] this together in the same order as this
[00:02:53] one and for it to be a record it has to
[00:02:57] be done within five minutes that's how
[00:02:59] it's in the competition so
[00:05:50] okay unbelievable no okay keep going
[00:05:53] 240 for the record is five minutes right
[00:05:56] well yeah there's just given to the
[00:05:58] record goes for the actual time
[00:06:00] memorized so what we're saying yeah is
[00:06:02] that it took you 53 seconds memorize the
[00:06:05] deck right it then took you two minutes
[00:06:08] and 45 seconds yeah
[00:06:10] to put all those cards in order here
[00:06:13] yeah wait at the very end when you were
[00:06:17] going through the cards that you had
[00:06:18] left over yeah those ones you weren't
[00:06:20] quite sure about and you had to figure
[00:06:22] it out and then put them in that order
[00:06:24] but when I was putting it back yeah yeah
[00:06:26] some that when I'm going through it in
[00:06:28] my head there are some holes but they
[00:06:30] come sometimes randomly while I'm
[00:06:32] figuring out the rest so I could see
[00:06:35] your brain working man it's just it's
[00:06:38] actually it's not working really it's
[00:06:40] just watching a movie like I've turned
[00:06:43] those cards into kind of a story like
[00:06:45] the first three cards with seven of
[00:06:48] diamonds
[00:06:49] queen of diamonds ten of spades and to
[00:06:51] me in my head I picture that as Gerard
[00:06:53] Depardieu the French actor with a
[00:06:56] shopping bag and he's putting laptops
[00:06:59] inside of it why would you come up with
[00:07:01] that image those cars I have a preset
[00:07:03] image for all these cards so whenever I
[00:07:05] see the seven of diamonds it's always
[00:07:06] Gerard Depardieu always and there's some
[00:07:10] translation coding the Queen of Hearts
[00:07:12] who's that that's my mom of course right
[00:07:16] now aces phase they just failed at
[00:07:19] Arnold Schwarzenegger yeah I'd be back
[00:07:22] so the reason it's ace of spades Arnold
[00:07:24] Schwarzenegger is because the ACE is an
[00:07:26] A and spades starts with an S so that's
[00:07:29] kind of the wearing code things as I
[00:07:30] look at the two letters and try to come
[00:07:33] up with someone that has those initials
[00:07:35] a s Arnold Schwarzenegger and over time
[00:07:38] those images are just a CSS phase it's
[00:07:40] Arnold I don't even have to think about
[00:07:42] it you know Ace of Diamonds maybe that's
[00:07:46] me why so a it also works like this a is
[00:07:51] also the first letter of the alphabet so
[00:07:53] one D for diamond D is the fourth letter
[00:07:56] alphabet so we have 14 and that's my
[00:07:58] favorite number
[00:07:59] at some point in time I have to sit down
[00:08:01] and say this is gonna be that this is
[00:08:03] gonna be that and then I just learned it
[00:08:04] how did it take you to get to this point
[00:08:08] and what got you on this fascinating
[00:08:11] journey so to get to 53 seconds took a
[00:08:14] lot of work almost two years of practice
[00:08:18] yeah everyday a couple hours a day yeah
[00:08:22] but what I can't say because this may
[00:08:24] sound very hard to do for anybody but
[00:08:27] actually anybody can do it and if they
[00:08:29] practice maybe a few times they can
[00:08:31] maybe do a deck of cards close to five
[00:08:33] minutes it's getting down to under a
[00:08:36] minute that's really the hard work you
[00:08:38] know there's a lot of things we want to
[00:08:40] ask you
[00:08:40] yeah I want you okay we are now going to
[00:08:46] do a let's flip over and flip them over
[00:08:49] okay sit which one you want to do this
[00:08:52] is the one that you put in order this is
[00:08:54] the one this is when you put in order
[00:08:55] that's when you memorize yes so you
[00:08:58] start flipping from the top and all okay
[00:09:04] all right so now cuz I put them into the
[00:09:09] other order that's where else so your
[00:09:11] top is my bottom okay unbelievable seven
[00:09:14] diamonds queen of diamonds
[00:09:18] get close on this they should all match
[00:09:22] up on believable
[00:09:36] Queen of Hearts there's a queen of
[00:09:38] hearts that's my mom that's your mom
[00:09:40] mama proud proud look at this
[00:09:46] unbelievable
[00:09:53] I'm real
[00:10:11] and the last one u.s. record Nelson

=== Nelson Dellis Memory Champ - TIME.com ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no06kSDdsxQ

[00:00:02] the first person obviously that I would
[00:00:06] like to introduce everybody understands
[00:00:09] who you're you're kind of evening for
[00:00:11] today is our defending champion from
[00:00:13] Texas and that's my can you please
[00:00:20] when I first read about it I've heard
[00:00:22] these memory guys were memorizing the
[00:00:24] numbers these cards like there's no way
[00:00:26] you know there's no way i could memorize
[00:00:28] a deck of cards in under two minutes and
[00:00:31] i did basically to remember anything you
[00:00:38] need a place to store it you need a
[00:00:40] place to put the information so let's
[00:00:41] say now I wanted to memorize five
[00:00:43] pictures that represent the presidents
[00:00:45] of the United States and then once I
[00:00:47] have my five spots selected these become
[00:00:49] places where I want to store whatever I
[00:00:51] want to remember I would take the first
[00:00:53] president which is Washington I would
[00:00:55] turn it into a picture and I would see a
[00:00:57] washing machine interacting with the
[00:00:59] bank of america sign maybe see the the
[00:01:01] clothes flying out and the soap going
[00:01:03] everywhere ever to watch the machine on
[00:01:04] bank of america and then right here on
[00:01:06] number two's which is the american eagle
[00:01:08] sign i would visualize a dam and the dam
[00:01:10] break in and it's filling up with water
[00:01:12] that's its flood in this area because a
[00:01:14] damn for adams and then number three I
[00:01:16] would pretend like that basketball
[00:01:17] player had a chef's hat on third
[00:01:19] president with shepperson or Jefferson
[00:01:21] and then to now it's visualized nyquil
[00:01:23] falling all over the stock market over
[00:01:25] there the fourth president was Madison
[00:01:27] and so I was medicine over there
[00:01:32] first of all I have a lot of respect for
[00:01:34] my competitors Nelson Dellis is a guy
[00:01:36] who was a surprise last year's in breaks
[00:01:38] one of my records the nerve of the guy
[00:01:40] you know second so he's a guy who could
[00:01:43] walk away with a vision terms of
[00:01:47] training I do about three to four hours
[00:01:49] a day for about a year I've been doing
[00:01:51] that I'll do you know numbers cards
[00:01:55] names and faces poetry going to this
[00:02:00] competition I just have to kind of rely
[00:02:03] on my training and hope to get those
[00:02:05] four
[00:02:09] okay mental assets if you are ready to
[00:02:12] amaze me I got this glossary in my head
[00:02:27] that I know that Steve equals stove Lisa
[00:02:29] equals the Mona Lisa Bryant equals a
[00:02:32] brain so then when I meet somebody and
[00:02:34] his name's Brian he's got really thick
[00:02:35] eyebrows I see a brain coming out of his
[00:02:38] eyebrows and it's Brian
[00:02:50] you talk to like an Olympic swimmer or
[00:02:52] something like they're intense in the
[00:02:53] water but out of the water they may be
[00:02:56] like the slowest kind of chill back you
[00:02:59] know they're not always an athlete right
[00:03:01] so a lot of people expect me to always
[00:03:03] have an awesome memory which is not
[00:03:05] necessarily the case i can I can kind of
[00:03:07] turn it on you know when I need it a lot
[00:03:11] of people think that okay this is not
[00:03:13] for me a horrible memory but that's the
[00:03:15] thing is like I didn't have a good
[00:03:17] memory i just had you know a little
[00:03:19] desire to do something
[00:03:24] you
[00:03:28] five minutes remaining the hard part
[00:03:31] about numbers is that a number is really
[00:03:33] abstract about what mental athletes do
[00:03:36] is we'll learn kind of a way to
[00:03:37] translate those into pictures so like 32
[00:03:41] 3 stands for c2 is be so CBI thought of
[00:03:46] Charlie Brown
[00:03:51] good job man new us a record yeah
[00:03:57] time
[00:04:01] what's your name how old are you and
[00:04:04] what are we back to do how you can do
[00:04:07] that furniture okay here we go if I ask
[00:04:12] someone can you imagine opening the
[00:04:14] front door and walk me through your
[00:04:15] house and if you can do that you can
[00:04:17] become a memory champion there you go
[00:04:20] Jefferson for Madison five they have a
[00:04:28] deck of cards and you pick it up and you
[00:04:30] run to it as fast as you can when you
[00:04:32] pick up the second deck of marginal
[00:04:33] reassemble that one to match the first
[00:04:35] deck without looking at it when it in
[00:04:47] three seconds of space six of spades
[00:05:05] George okay jack States more arts a lot
[00:05:14] of competitors in this sport they became
[00:05:16] kind of obsessed with improving even
[00:05:18] more designers for a horse
[00:05:23] you kind of harness these power in your
[00:05:25] brain and you're like
[00:05:30] oh I would just like to be the first one
[00:05:32] to be dressed like to do us a champion

[00:00:24] could so uh uh then I'm done I have
[00:00:26] nothing else to actually um you could if
[00:00:28] you trained yourself turns out only 2%
[00:00:30] of Americans have a photographic memory
[00:00:32] the rest is all training so this past
[00:00:35] weekend all that training led up to the
[00:00:37] 14th annual USA memory
[00:00:41] Champion here is Jordan yes Jordan Mack
[00:00:45] androe
[00:00:46] and delis you may not have heard of that
[00:00:50] last guy but Nelson dallis like Jordan
[00:00:52] and mackenro is at the top of his game
[00:00:55] as a memory athlete you expect to find
[00:00:57] someone who's just naturally good at
[00:00:59] meory iing things but that's not the
[00:01:01] case ever everybody who competes in
[00:01:02] these competition train their
[00:01:05] memory which for Nelson means treating
[00:01:07] it like any other passion I train every
[00:01:10] day I'm trying to compete and win so
[00:01:13] it's it's at another level but um
[00:01:15] keeping my mind stimulated is kind of My
[00:01:18] Philosophy you know of life is is you
[00:01:21] know I I work out my body but I also
[00:01:23] work out my my brain before you think
[00:01:25] this memory business isn't for you keep
[00:01:28] this in mind anybody can do this this
[00:01:31] you could do it anybody on the street
[00:01:32] could do it it's it's understanding how
[00:01:34] the brain works and taking advantage of
[00:01:36] it to get a better idea of what a memory
[00:01:39] athlete can do we put Nelson's memory
[00:01:42] where his Mantra is hey hi I'm Nelson hi
[00:01:44] I'm Jim Bell I'm Matt Kaitlyn Eric Jenna
[00:01:47] Jenna Bush Hager Emily ra I am Don how
[00:01:51] you doing after meeting and greeting 55
[00:01:53] Today's Show staffers spending less than
[00:01:56] 5 seconds with each one hi Matt L nice
[00:01:58] to meet nice to meet you Jackie eget to
[00:02:01] meet you we sat Nelson down to see how
[00:02:03] we did yeah raik raika great that's Don
[00:02:07] uh Candace yes Debbie that's Carrie
[00:02:11] that's Matt yep in the end he missed
[00:02:14] only one don't remember his so how does
[00:02:17] he do it being able to convert what you
[00:02:19] want to memorize into vivid pictures so
[00:02:22] say he have to a grocery list you know
[00:02:24] you want to be able to look at those
[00:02:26] words say like milk and actually picture
[00:02:28] milk to truly test the theory that
[00:02:30] anyone could do this I dove in head
[00:02:33] first and entered the USA memory
[00:02:36] Championship first up a little training
[00:02:39] and by a little I mean a lot hash Tanaka
[00:02:43] okay now let's focus on the last name
[00:02:46] Tanaka sounds like what Baka breath
[00:02:50] spray bre breaths spray so what does
[00:02:53] Baka breath spray have to do with Hashi
[00:02:56] Tanaka so now we want to connect either
[00:02:58] one of those to the the feature that you
[00:03:00] chose on the face the nose the mouth the
[00:03:03] eyes the forehead and the cheekbones and
[00:03:06] that's where you're going to hang your
[00:03:08] picture in terms of the visual image
[00:03:10] you're going to create for the person's
[00:03:12] name so tell me the story you use to
[00:03:14] memorize my name I did that wolf I did
[00:03:17] like a like your hair was like a little
[00:03:19] different colors so like different
[00:03:20] shades of the wolf's
[00:03:23] coat competition day came my goal
[00:03:27] remembering 117 faces first and last
[00:03:30] names with proper spelling all in 15
[00:03:34] minutes I could lie to you and tell you
[00:03:36] that I'm not nervous but I'm actually
[00:03:37] quite nervous okay ment athletes if you
[00:03:39] are ready you may begin and with that I
[00:03:42] was on the
[00:03:47] clock that was the hardest thing I've
[00:03:49] ever
[00:03:50] done and I only competed in one event
[00:03:53] there were seven different
[00:03:55] tests eight of clubs eight CL it is for
[00:04:00] space more space how did Nelson do
[00:04:02] considering he spent a whole day
[00:04:04] practicing at the Today Show oh I would
[00:04:06] just like to be the first one to
[00:04:08] congratulate the new USA champion
[00:04:13] Nelson Nelson indeed won joins us here
[00:04:17] this morning and I want to reemphasize
[00:04:19] the point that anybody could do this the
[00:04:21] Nelson does not have a photographic
[00:04:23] memory in fact he was here you in
[00:04:25] addition to winning the Hulk
[00:04:26] Championship he also won the US record
[00:04:28] for the amount of numbers sequential
[00:04:30] numbers in a row that he memorized 248
[00:04:33] numbers in how much time 5 minutes 5
[00:04:35] minutes 5 minutes in a row so here are
[00:04:37] the all the people that we had in our
[00:04:38] office so pick three random people and
[00:04:41] Nelson hasn't been here in two weeks and
[00:04:43] just to give you an idea of how much
[00:04:44] this sticks and I say this only because
[00:04:46] we come across people all the time that
[00:04:48] we meet just to go to show you that this
[00:04:50] technique which I'll explain to you in a
[00:04:51] second actually works so go ahead and
[00:04:53] and okay so four here we go ready go all
[00:04:55] right so this is antoanet very good uh
[00:04:58] that's Elizabeth oh my God and that's
[00:05:00] derell one that is uh Jenny
[00:05:05] nice and this is after the competition
[00:05:08] and everything else distracting I hav I
[00:05:09] mean I haven't thought about it since I
[00:05:11] met them now with somebody like Matt La
[00:05:13] how do you remember that it's Matt La
[00:05:15] you know it's a lot easier when you see
[00:05:17] someone every day well wait a second how
[00:05:19] did you do oh okay so here's the thing
[00:05:21] there were 38 people that competed I
[00:05:23] came in 30 out of 38 which means eight
[00:05:25] people that trained the entire year for
[00:05:28] this did worse then I did don't it in so
[00:05:31] I'm going to I don't know who those are
[00:05:33] Nelson what about those games like say
[00:05:35] on a Nintendo that the Brain Brain Brain
[00:05:37] AG yeah does that do anything I mean I
[00:05:39] I've never had experience with it but um
[00:05:42] I I I feel like yes I mean any activity
[00:05:44] you can do with your brain that kind of
[00:05:45] stimulates like crosswords and doing
[00:05:47] mental math and this type of
[00:05:49] memorization stuff is very good couldn't
[00:05:51] you use this in Vegas probably we should
[00:05:54] also say Nelson wasn't a straight A
[00:05:56] student in school he was an average
[00:05:57] student so anyone and any child and any
[00:05:59] person can do this it's just you know
[00:06:02] where my car keys are sock
[00:06:04] congratulations we're back after your
[00:06:06] local news and weather how cool

[00:00:10] lot more as Victor okendo reports he
[00:00:12] recently broke a national memory record
[00:00:16] uh a dog is playing the banjo with a
[00:00:18] mushroom this is how um grad student
[00:00:21] Nelson delis sees these numbers I

[00:00:26] include uh former teachers um girlfriend
[00:00:31] uh famous actors he's a memory athlete
[00:00:34] who just set a US record at the US

[00:00:42] 500 digigit number with only 5 Minutes
[00:00:45] to study it any anybody can learn this
[00:00:48] uh so I took it upon myself to learn it
[00:00:51] I wrote These numbers on the Blackboard
[00:00:52] and Dallas was ready to recite all 60
[00:00:55] after looking over them for just a few
[00:00:57] minutes 9 7 8

[00:01:04] cards seven of
[00:01:07] Spades
[00:01:10] um five of
[00:01:12] Spades uh three of clubs one of the

[00:01:20] remember them Trent Eric uh chrisy
[00:01:24] Krueger Lori Jennings delis says these
[00:01:26] skills are useful in and out of the
[00:01:29] classroom using the the techniques uh
[00:01:31] for names is super useful especially
[00:01:34] when you're um at an event or at a party
[00:01:38] in August he plans on competing in the

[00:02:05] thing but a whole deck of cards that oh
[00:02:07] my goodness


=== Nelson Dellis on Channel 10 - #2 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zirvjfsnmjc

[00:00:01] but most of us can barely remember what
[00:00:03] we did yesterday let alone a whole bunch
[00:00:06] of random facts but one university of
[00:00:07] miami student right here has the memory
[00:00:09] of an elephant and is breaking records
[00:00:11] doing that to nelson dallas's his name
[00:00:13] set a u.s record earlier this month by
[00:00:15] recalling 178 randomly selected numbers
[00:00:20] incredible your story isn't how long
[00:00:22] have you been doing this i've been
[00:00:24] training for about a year um i competed
[00:00:26] last year did our right middle of the
[00:00:28] pack and then since then i've been kind
[00:00:31] of taking okay uh timeout you train now
[00:00:34] you you train to lift weights how do you
[00:00:36] train the mind yeah so the brain is kind
[00:00:38] of like a muscle you got to train it to
[00:00:40] be good at
[00:00:41] you know
[00:00:42] memorizing or you know crossword puzzles
[00:00:44] it's stuff that takes time when you do
[00:00:46] it every day um and so i train my memory
[00:00:49] i do
[00:00:50] um
[00:00:51] different exercises every day uh like
[00:00:53] memorizing decks of cards or long
[00:00:55] strings of numbers we're going to get to
[00:00:56] that in just one second but it says you
[00:00:58] remember the first 178 digits of a
[00:01:01] randomly generated 500 digit number with
[00:01:04] only five minutes to study right yeah
[00:01:07] i'm confused talking about that that's
[00:01:09] incredible yeah
[00:01:11] and you beat the guy from last year who
[00:01:13] was pretty good who have been doing it
[00:01:14] much longer than you he had said the
[00:01:15] record uh the previous year for 167 so
[00:01:19] wow yeah that's incredible pretty
[00:01:21] excellent okay and uh on another note
[00:01:24] too i want to talk about your
[00:01:25] grandmother she passed away but you're
[00:01:26] going to do something in her honor tell
[00:01:28] us about it right i'm going to be
[00:01:29] climbing uh mount everest next year

[00:01:34] the process she suffered from
[00:01:35] alzheimer's
[00:01:36] and
[00:01:38] it's something that's pretty important
[00:01:39] to me and that's why i train my mind is
[00:01:41] kind of to
[00:01:42] not end up uh with memory problems
[00:01:45] that's pretty awesome man well you have

[00:03:32] ridiculous yeah that sounds more
[00:03:34] confusing yeah but that's it
[00:03:36] having to imagine that rather than the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSowVM7WeTU

[00:00:00] we summited yesterday
[00:00:03] and we have one more day in this tent
[00:00:05] maybe two we'll see
[00:00:07] but uh mike has to give his final words
[00:00:10] on the mountain of inspiration
[00:00:13] so
[00:00:15] hello friends
[00:00:17] sometimes in daily life
[00:00:20] you find yourself needing to go the
[00:00:22] extra mile
[00:00:23] to prove something to yourself
[00:00:26] to make a difference
[00:00:27] to see something
[00:00:29] in your life that wasn't there before
[00:00:31] but spending 16 days on a mountain with
[00:00:34] no shower
[00:00:35] bad food
[00:00:36] worrying if your hands are freezing off
[00:00:39] barely able to breathe is really going
[00:00:41] overboard i recommend not doing
[00:00:43] something like this ever
[00:00:45] in case i agree
[00:00:48] why don't you tell us a little bit about
[00:00:49] your hat there
[00:00:51] this is my lucky ebay hat which i stole
[00:00:55] from
