=== How To ABSORB TEXTBOOKS Like A Sponge ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu7Yqxlc3ec

[00:00:00] I've been a learning coach for over a
[00:00:01] decade. And in this video, I'll show you
[00:00:02] how you can absorb textbooks like a
[00:00:05] sponge. I'll teach you a four-part
[00:00:07] method that allows you to learn,
[00:00:09] remember, and use any new information in
[00:00:12] a way that feels effortless. This method
[00:00:14] works by overcoming a biological barrier
[00:00:17] that's hardwired into our brain that
[00:00:20] actually prevents it from absorbing new
[00:00:22] information more quickly in the first
[00:00:24] place. So, we need to address this
[00:00:26] barrier first if we want to make any
[00:00:27] progress. So what is this biological
[00:00:30] barrier? Researchers have actually found
[00:00:32] that there seems to be a limit on how
[00:00:35] much new information your brain can
[00:00:37] store at any given time. In learning
[00:00:39] science, this process of taking
[00:00:41] information and then storing it into our
[00:00:43] memory is called encoding. If someone's
[00:00:46] able to learn information like a sponge
[00:00:48] and hold on to all of this information
[00:00:51] in their memory, you're basically
[00:00:53] saying, "This person has really good
[00:00:55] encoding." Whenever we encode new
[00:00:57] information, we think that your brain is
[00:00:59] probably physically remodeling itself at
[00:01:02] a microscopic level. And so, one theory
[00:01:04] is that our brain has an inbuilt defense
[00:01:06] mechanism that stops it from making too
[00:01:09] many changes too quickly in case some of
[00:01:12] those changes are harmful to us. After
[00:01:14] all, the human brain did not adapt to
[00:01:16] learn this much information in one go.
[00:01:19] So that feeling you get when you're
[00:01:20] reading something really dense and
[00:01:22] really detailed and you feel overwhelmed
[00:01:24] and you feel like that information is
[00:01:26] just leaking out of your brain and you
[00:01:28] cannot hold on to it. That's basically
[00:01:30] you realizing the biological limit of
[00:01:33] your brain. So while it is difficult to
[00:01:36] increase the raw power of your brain,
[00:01:39] there are some things that we can do
[00:01:41] that help our brain process this new
[00:01:44] information which makes encoding easier.
[00:01:47] And doing these things is the trick to
[00:01:50] faster encoding and absorbing
[00:01:51] information like a sponge. And there are
[00:01:53] three things that I want you to
[00:01:55] remember. Your brain finds it easier to
[00:01:57] encode information
[00:01:59] when these three things are met. Number
[00:02:03] one,
[00:02:05] intention. Number two, relevance. And
[00:02:09] number three, familiarity. When all
[00:02:12] three of these conditions are met, your
[00:02:14] brain is able to encode more easily and
[00:02:16] more quickly. Intention just means
[00:02:20] literally wanting and trying to
[00:02:23] understand and remember something. This
[00:02:24] is really obvious. Reading this book
[00:02:26] without even intending or trying to
[00:02:29] learn it means that it's going to be
[00:02:30] less effective than trying to learn it.
[00:02:32] The second one is relevance. Relevance
[00:02:35] is how important we think this new
[00:02:38] information is. And there are two ways
[00:02:39] it can be relevant. It can be relevant
[00:02:41] because it influences and impacts
[00:02:43] something we already know or it
[00:02:46] influences and impacts other new pieces
[00:02:48] of information that we're learning. And
[00:02:50] familiarity is about how similar what
[00:02:53] you are learning now is with what you
[00:02:55] already know. When you are intending to
[00:02:57] learn something and it feels significant
[00:03:00] and impactful to something else and it
[00:03:02] is familiar to what you already know,
[00:03:05] then this is easier for your brain to
[00:03:07] store into your memory. You can remember
[00:03:08] these three points with the pneumonic I
[00:03:11] remember fast. But here's the problem.
[00:03:15] Normally, when we're trying to learn
[00:03:16] something, we only control our
[00:03:19] intention. When we're struggling to
[00:03:21] learn or remember something, we just try
[00:03:23] to remember it harder. Whether something
[00:03:26] is relevant or familiar is almost just
[00:03:30] up to luck. Sometimes what we're
[00:03:32] learning might seem more familiar and
[00:03:34] may seem more relevant and sometimes it
[00:03:37] doesn't. And especially when you're
[00:03:38] reading from something like a thick
[00:03:39] textbook, often the details are very
[00:03:42] dense and it's hard to see how this is
[00:03:44] relevant and most of it is new and
[00:03:47] unfamiliar. And so because we are only
[00:03:49] trying to increase our intention and we
[00:03:51] rarely ever try to increase the
[00:03:54] relevance or try to increase
[00:03:55] familiarity, there is a hard limit on
[00:03:58] how much we can encode and how quickly
[00:04:00] we can do it. Now, you may ask, "But
[00:04:02] Justin, how can we make something more
[00:04:05] relevant and more familiar if we're
[00:04:08] learning it for the first time and we
[00:04:10] just don't see how it's relevant?" The
[00:04:12] answer is by using this four-part
[00:04:14] method. You can remember this method
[00:04:16] with the acronym
[00:04:18] L2R2. The first L is layman's. Now, if
[00:04:22] you're not familiar, the word layman
[00:04:24] means to describe something really
[00:04:25] simply without using special
[00:04:27] terminology. So if I said to you, active
[00:04:30] learning involves higher intrinsic
[00:04:32] cognitive load, that's hard to
[00:04:35] understand unless you're already
[00:04:36] familiar with this topic. The lay man's
[00:04:39] explanation for it would be effective
[00:04:42] learning means thinking harder. The
[00:04:45] first part of this method is for any new
[00:04:47] information you're learning, especially
[00:04:49] if it's dense. And it doesn't just have
[00:04:50] to be in a textbook. It could be reading
[00:04:52] journal articles. It could be lecture
[00:04:54] slides. Whatever you're trying to learn,
[00:04:56] try to learn it in just layman's terms.
[00:05:00] Simple language first. Remove all the
[00:05:03] terminology. Anything that's tricky or
[00:05:05] complicated to understand, rewrap it in
[00:05:08] a way that you could explain it to an
[00:05:10] average everyday person. Taking the time
[00:05:13] to learn something in layman's terms
[00:05:14] first dramatically improves your ability
[00:05:17] to learn and understand this new topic.
[00:05:20] Why does that work? This is because
[00:05:21] learning it in layman's terms increases
[00:05:24] our familiarity. We are not familiar
[00:05:27] with all this new terminology and all
[00:05:29] these dense new concepts. We don't know
[00:05:32] what this new detail means and why we
[00:05:35] need to learn it. But by turning it into
[00:05:37] simple language and simple ideas that
[00:05:40] we're already familiar with, it also
[00:05:42] becomes easier to see how this can
[00:05:44] influence and impact something else. In
[00:05:48] other words, by making it more familiar,
[00:05:50] it also makes it easier for us to see
[00:05:53] how it is relevant. So, how can you do
[00:05:55] this? When you first go to open up a new
[00:05:57] chapter and you're reading through,
[00:05:59] point out and look at the headings and
[00:06:01] the bold words first. Scan and skim
[00:06:05] through everything that you need to
[00:06:06] learn and actually pick out what you
[00:06:08] think are the most important key
[00:06:10] concepts and write them out separately.
[00:06:12] Then and this is really easy these days
[00:06:15] just go to your favorite AI program and
[00:06:18] say I am learning this topic here are
[00:06:21] the key words that I will have to learn
[00:06:23] about explain these to me in layman's
[00:06:27] terms so it is simple for me to
[00:06:29] understand this entire process can take
[00:06:31] you less than 10 minutes and after 10
[00:06:34] minutes this chapter will suddenly feel
[00:06:37] very approachable and very familiar to
[00:06:40] you. you will feel ready to go and learn
[00:06:42] about each of these concepts because you
[00:06:44] already understand how they work at a
[00:06:46] simple level. Another tip is to use
[00:06:47] something like Google images. For any
[00:06:49] keywords that represent a process or a
[00:06:52] cycle or a sequence of events or a
[00:06:55] framework, type them into Google and
[00:06:57] then go straight to Google images and
[00:06:59] just look for images that seem simple to
[00:07:02] understand. This is leveraging off of
[00:07:04] our visual processing ability, which is
[00:07:07] tens of thousands of times more
[00:07:09] efficient than our reading ability.
[00:07:11] Simply seeing an image of a concept
[00:07:13] being explained can help us to
[00:07:15] understand it much more efficiently than
[00:07:17] even a really simply explained AI
[00:07:20] generated summary. Now, one thing I
[00:07:22] always try to do as much in layman's
[00:07:24] terms as possible is teaching you about
[00:07:27] learning science. And one place that you
[00:07:28] can see me trying to do this is in my
[00:07:30] free weekly newsletter where I share
[00:07:33] tips and tricks and techniques like the
[00:07:34] ones I'm sharing with you now, but to
[00:07:37] your inbox every single week. I take the
[00:07:39] things that I wish I had known that made
[00:07:41] a difference to my learning efficiency
[00:07:43] over the years, and I distill them into
[00:07:45] these quick emails that you can read in
[00:07:47] 3 to 5 minutes in layman's terms, but
[00:07:49] potentially saving you dozens of hours a
[00:07:52] month through just efficiency. Again, if
[00:07:54] you're interested, it's completely free.
[00:07:55] The link's in the description to join.
[00:07:56] But anyway, that was the first L,
[00:07:58] learning it in layman's first. Once
[00:08:00] you've done this, you should move on to
[00:08:02] the second L. The second L stands for
[00:08:06] layer. Layering your learning is one of
[00:08:09] the most powerful methods you can use.
[00:08:12] When you're covering really dense
[00:08:14] information like in a textbook, like
[00:08:16] reading a journal article, it's really
[00:08:19] difficult to get all of that information
[00:08:21] in in one go. Even when you have gone
[00:08:24] through a layman's explanation of it, it
[00:08:26] can be easily overwhelming, but only if
[00:08:30] you learn it the way it tells you to.
[00:08:33] Layering your learning is about you
[00:08:35] taking control of how you think this
[00:08:39] information will make sense for you and
[00:08:42] your brain. And it's actually very
[00:08:44] simple. All you do is when you're
[00:08:46] reading through it, deliberately look
[00:08:48] for the things that feel more relevant
[00:08:52] or feel more familiar to you. Spend time
[00:08:55] trying to learn and understand and
[00:08:57] connect that information. And if you
[00:08:59] read something that you can't see how
[00:09:01] it's relevant, it's very detailed, it's
[00:09:03] very unfamiliar, and you're struggling
[00:09:05] to see how it connects with anything
[00:09:07] else, just skip it and put a little
[00:09:10] sticky note next to it. note it down
[00:09:12] somewhere so you can come back to it
[00:09:14] later. Go through your chapter or your
[00:09:17] readings with this mindset, picking out
[00:09:19] the parts that are relevant and then
[00:09:22] building your knowledge first with what
[00:09:24] is already relevant and familiar and
[00:09:27] then go back to the parts that you
[00:09:28] skipped. Now the magical thing happens
[00:09:32] which is that those things that you
[00:09:34] didn't see why they're irrelevant. They
[00:09:36] were very unfamiliar. You didn't see how
[00:09:38] they connected the first time around. It
[00:09:40] might have taken you 15 minutes to
[00:09:42] figure out that paragraph. When you look
[00:09:45] at it now it's going to be much easier
[00:09:48] because you have more information about
[00:09:50] the topic. Now you're one step closer to
[00:09:54] expertise than you were before. anything
[00:09:57] complicated. It's just a lot of simple
[00:10:00] things put together. If it feels
[00:10:01] complicated, it just means you don't
[00:10:04] know all the simple things yet. So
[00:10:05] instead of trying to figure it out now,
[00:10:07] just learn the simple things first and
[00:10:08] come back to it. Layering your learning
[00:10:10] massively increases how relevant what
[00:10:14] you're learning is. And it ensures that
[00:10:15] you're not wasting time right now on
[00:10:18] something that you should just come back
[00:10:20] to later. So that's the L2. And now we
[00:10:22] move on to the R2 of this four-part
[00:10:24] method. The first R stands for
[00:10:29] relevance framing. Effective learning is
[00:10:33] like solving a jigsaw puzzle. You're
[00:10:35] getting new information from a lecture
[00:10:38] or an article or a textbook, wherever,
[00:10:40] and you're looking at this new
[00:10:41] information, trying to see it, trying to
[00:10:43] understand it, and asking yourself,
[00:10:46] where does this fit in the big picture
[00:10:48] of the jigsaw puzzle I'm building, aka
[00:10:51] the knowledge I'm trying to build? When
[00:10:52] you find the right place for it to fit,
[00:10:55] it helps to complete the big picture.
[00:10:57] When you find the wrong place, it means
[00:10:59] that the picture becomes incomplete,
[00:11:01] inaccurate, and if you don't know where
[00:11:03] it fits and you're just trying to hold
[00:11:04] on to it, that's the stuff that you
[00:11:06] inevitably just forget. Now, the problem
[00:11:08] is that, like I said before, most of the
[00:11:10] time we're just thinking about
[00:11:12] increasing our intention. We're not
[00:11:14] actively thinking about how we can make
[00:11:15] this new information, each new jigsaw
[00:11:18] piece, more relevant and more familiar.
[00:11:20] So, this is kind of like two people
[00:11:22] solving a jigsaw puzzle. One person all
[00:11:24] they do is pick up pieces out of the
[00:11:26] board, look at it, and then just throw
[00:11:28] it at this other person who desperately
[00:11:30] has to see where this fits constantly.
[00:11:33] And between the person whose job it is
[00:11:35] just to pick pieces out of a box and
[00:11:37] throw it at someone versus the person
[00:11:39] who has to actually make the picture,
[00:11:42] you can see who's got the harder job.
[00:11:43] This is basically what happens when we
[00:11:45] learn. we are just forcing all of this
[00:11:47] dense information into our brain and
[00:11:49] just hoping that this picture will be
[00:11:52] formed. Relevance framing is stopping
[00:11:56] that and it's about communicating
[00:11:58] between these two people. It's about
[00:12:01] saying okay what piece are you looking
[00:12:04] for? What does the picture look like?
[00:12:06] What kind of pieces with what kind of
[00:12:08] edges should I hunt for? And then once
[00:12:12] you know that you then go into the box,
[00:12:15] you go into the textbook to look for
[00:12:18] those pieces to look for that
[00:12:20] information. So how do we actually
[00:12:21] create these relevance frames? Well, one
[00:12:23] very easy way is to just look at test
[00:12:25] questions or end of chapter questions
[00:12:28] before you start properly going through
[00:12:30] all the content. You can do your
[00:12:31] layman's explanation first. You can go
[00:12:34] through and just pick out the parts that
[00:12:35] are really obvious to you to begin with
[00:12:38] if you want, but before you really sit
[00:12:40] down to properly go through all the
[00:12:42] little detail, just go through and test
[00:12:44] yourself. Get a sense for how you're
[00:12:47] going to need to use this knowledge in
[00:12:49] professional or real world settings.
[00:12:50] Think about how you are going to use
[00:12:52] this knowledge in the real world. What
[00:12:55] type of problems would it solve? How can
[00:12:57] I apply this? Why is this important and
[00:13:00] significant for me to know? And if
[00:13:01] you're struggling with this, use chatbt,
[00:13:04] use Google, ask it, why would I need to
[00:13:06] know this? And once it's clear to you
[00:13:09] why it is relevant, write it down. Put
[00:13:12] it on a separate piece of paper while
[00:13:13] you're studying so that as you're
[00:13:15] reading through, you can constantly
[00:13:17] check back to it to see, is this
[00:13:20] relevant? And if so, how. It's the
[00:13:22] equivalent of having the jigsaw puzzle
[00:13:24] image next to you. So when you look at
[00:13:26] each piece, you have an idea about where
[00:13:28] it might fit. And this isn't something
[00:13:30] that you just do once and it's done. You
[00:13:32] can continue trying to create new
[00:13:34] relevance frames with each layer that
[00:13:37] you go through. So, as you get more and
[00:13:39] more detailed, ask yourself, which parts
[00:13:43] of what I'm learning still feel like it
[00:13:45] doesn't quite make sense? Which parts
[00:13:48] are harder for me to understand? Which
[00:13:49] are the ones that feel less relevant and
[00:13:52] less familiar? And ask yourself clear,
[00:13:55] explicit questions about those. Don't
[00:13:57] just say, "I generally feel less
[00:14:00] comfortable with this part of the
[00:14:01] topic." Ask yourself why you feel less
[00:14:04] clear. What information are you missing?
[00:14:07] It's looking at your half complete
[00:14:09] jigsaw puzzle. Noticing that there's a
[00:14:11] part that isn't complete instead of just
[00:14:13] generally knowing that there's something
[00:14:15] there. It's looking at it clearly and
[00:14:16] saying, "Okay, what type of pieces
[00:14:19] should I be looking for to fill that?"
[00:14:21] that. And so relevance framing boosts
[00:14:23] your ability to encode information
[00:14:24] through obviously improving your
[00:14:27] relevance. Now the final R of R2 is real
[00:14:33] estate. And I've done this in blue
[00:14:35] because this is actually something that
[00:14:36] you do throughout the entire process of
[00:14:40] L2R2. It's not something you just do at
[00:14:42] the end. You should be applying this
[00:14:44] throughout the entire process of
[00:14:46] learning.
[00:14:47] Real estate refers to your mental real
[00:14:50] estate. Basically, your mental capacity
[00:14:53] to hold on to information and to process
[00:14:55] it. You only have so much mental
[00:14:59] capacity. Like all humans, not just you.
[00:15:02] The human brain can only handle so much
[00:15:04] information. And we have to protect our
[00:15:06] mental resources. If we start using our
[00:15:10] precious mental resources to just try to
[00:15:12] track on and remember every single idea
[00:15:15] that we're learning through a textbook,
[00:15:16] we're going to get very very quickly
[00:15:18] overwhelmed. It doesn't matter how smart
[00:15:19] you are, how experienced of a learner,
[00:15:21] it's just a matter of time before you
[00:15:23] feel overwhelmed. What you want to do is
[00:15:25] make sure that your effort, your mental
[00:15:27] effort, those cognitive resources are
[00:15:30] used only for processing, understanding
[00:15:34] the ideas and trying to fit it into the
[00:15:36] big picture. You want the figuring out
[00:15:39] the jigsaw puzzle part of your brain to
[00:15:41] be very uninterrupted because the faster
[00:15:44] they are solving the puzzle, the faster
[00:15:47] you can learn. When they get stuck,
[00:15:48] everything stops. And the easiest way to
[00:15:51] protect that mental real estate and to
[00:15:53] just let your brain focus on just
[00:15:55] encoding that information is to think on
[00:15:58] paper. Write your thoughts down,
[00:16:00] document it, use your note-taking as a
[00:16:03] cognitive offload. Do not try to hold on
[00:16:05] to all the ideas of how you think things
[00:16:08] are connected and where your gaps might
[00:16:09] be mentally. Write it down. Look at your
[00:16:13] notes. Use your notes to help you think
[00:16:15] about it. Look at your notes and see
[00:16:17] where there might be gaps and things
[00:16:18] that you're missing. If you think these
[00:16:21] two things influence each other, but
[00:16:23] you're not sure, it doesn't matter. Just
[00:16:24] write it down first. Don't bother your
[00:16:28] brain capacity by trying to just hold on
[00:16:31] to this idea. When you look at the notes
[00:16:34] of an efficient learner who has their
[00:16:36] processes tuned in, their notes should
[00:16:39] be a reflection of their thinking
[00:16:41] process. You should be able to see the
[00:16:43] process of how ideas initially start
[00:16:46] scattered and disorganized and how
[00:16:48] slowly they start organizing together to
[00:16:51] form a cohesive picture. And so
[00:16:53] protecting your mental real estate
[00:16:56] doesn't by itself increase the
[00:16:58] familiarity or the relevance or your
[00:17:00] intention, but it just makes all of this
[00:17:03] stuff much much easier. So this is the
[00:17:07] L2R2 fourpart method that you can use to
[00:17:10] help your brain absorb information like
[00:17:11] a sponge. And if you want some more tips
[00:17:13] on how you can learn more effectively,
[00:17:14] then you might be interested in this
[00:17:15] video here.
[00:17:19] I can never tell which side of the
[00:17:21] screen it's I I should just memorize
[00:17:23] this. Which side of the screen the video
[00:17:24] play cards pop up on.


=== How To Learn as a Busy Professional - Full Masterclass ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7h1D2uA09I

[00:00:00] I've been a learning coach for the past
[00:00:01] 13 years. I've coached hundreds of
[00:00:04] professionals, entrepreneurs, and CEOs
[00:00:07] to learn effectively even under immense
[00:00:09] time pressures and responsibilities.
[00:00:11] This is going to be no BS advice on how
[00:00:13] to learn as a professional. Number one,
[00:00:15] start from zero. Let's say we have two
[00:00:18] different types of professionals. The
[00:00:19] first is a great diligent student
[00:00:21] throughout university and the other is a
[00:00:24] university dropout. Of the two, which
[00:00:27] would you think is easier to coach to
[00:00:29] become a super efficient learner? In my
[00:00:31] experience, most of the time, the second
[00:00:33] person who struggled, was a terrible
[00:00:36] student, is actually easier to coach.
[00:00:39] This is because they actually have less
[00:00:41] built-in habits of learning. A lot of
[00:00:44] professionals struggle with learning,
[00:00:46] especially with high workloads, because
[00:00:48] when they start learning, they use the
[00:00:50] same techniques and habits that they
[00:00:52] were used to while going through
[00:00:54] university. not realizing that those
[00:00:57] methods are not serving them anymore.
[00:00:58] And a lot of the time it didn't serve
[00:01:00] them back then either. They just got
[00:01:01] away with it. And it's not to say that
[00:01:03] book smarts is not important, but it's
[00:01:06] about understanding that your learning
[00:01:08] system probably is a combination of good
[00:01:10] habits that are working and you should
[00:01:12] keep doing them and then bad habits that
[00:01:14] are holding you back which you are
[00:01:16] probably not even aware of. And the hard
[00:01:18] part about becoming an efficient learner
[00:01:19] is not actually just learning new
[00:01:22] methods and techniques. That is easy.
[00:01:24] The hard part is discovering and then
[00:01:27] unlearning your existing bad habits that
[00:01:29] have set in over years. So start from
[00:01:32] zero means just wipe the slate clean.
[00:01:35] Forget about the way you used to learn.
[00:01:38] If it's still working for you now, it
[00:01:40] will come back into your system. But
[00:01:42] don't build your learning system from,
[00:01:44] okay, here's what I used to do in
[00:01:46] university. Let's start from that. Just
[00:01:48] start from what is my learning goal?
[00:01:50] What's my current situation? and then
[00:01:51] just build from a blank slate. Number
[00:01:53] two, learn in sprints. When you go
[00:01:56] through uni, everything is laid out for
[00:01:59] you. There's a curriculum to follow and
[00:02:01] all you have to do is just learn what's
[00:02:03] given to you and then hit the
[00:02:04] assessment, which they usually tell you
[00:02:06] how they're going to market. None of
[00:02:08] that applies in a professional learning
[00:02:10] context. However, having that structure
[00:02:13] makes it much easier to learn. So, one
[00:02:16] of the things that I recommend any
[00:02:17] professional to do is to actually set
[00:02:18] very clear, explicit learning goals,
[00:02:21] almost like lecture objectives for
[00:02:22] yourself. What do I need to know? How
[00:02:25] well do I need to know it? And in what
[00:02:27] time frame do I need to achieve this
[00:02:29] expertise by? Once you've set your
[00:02:30] learning goals, learn aggressively. This
[00:02:33] is the sprint part. Consume as much as
[00:02:35] you can about this topic until you feel
[00:02:37] like you're starting to lose track of
[00:02:39] it. It's a little overwhelming. And that
[00:02:40] may actually only take like a few hours
[00:02:44] of learning about it and then apply what
[00:02:46] you've learned immediately. So the
[00:02:48] sprint is setting a learning goal,
[00:02:51] consuming about this aggressively, and
[00:02:53] then applying it usually for a more
[00:02:55] extended period of time. Once you've
[00:02:57] applied it enough that this new
[00:02:59] knowledge feels like your own and you're
[00:03:01] pretty comfortable with it, then you can
[00:03:03] move into your next sprint where you set
[00:03:05] your next learning goal and then again
[00:03:06] consume aggressively. There's been
[00:03:08] situations where I've spent maybe two
[00:03:10] weeks to read a few books on something
[00:03:12] and then I'll spend six months just
[00:03:14] applying what I've learned because I
[00:03:16] don't feel comfortable enough to consume
[00:03:18] more information without having
[00:03:20] consolidated and lived through the
[00:03:23] learning that I've already accumulated.
[00:03:24] Remember that the value of learning as a
[00:03:26] professional is your ability to execute
[00:03:29] and apply that knowledge. It doesn't
[00:03:31] matter how much you've consumed and how
[00:03:32] much you know. If you can't actually use
[00:03:34] that and if you don't have the wisdom to
[00:03:36] use that in the right way, it's
[00:03:38] ultimately meaningless. Number three,
[00:03:41] lead don't follow. I go around the world
[00:03:43] doing workshops for various different
[00:03:46] industries. And when I work with new
[00:03:48] graduates, one of the most common things
[00:03:50] that I see is that the new graduates
[00:03:53] that really excel, whose managers see a
[00:03:56] lot of potential in them, that they're
[00:03:57] being picked to be the rising stars,
[00:03:59] they do something different to the
[00:04:02] typical graduate. And it's very rare.
[00:04:04] What they do is they put themselves in
[00:04:06] the mindset of becoming the expert. And
[00:04:10] this is actually really important when
[00:04:11] it comes to learning because the way
[00:04:13] your brain will store and organize new
[00:04:16] information that you learn is heavily
[00:04:19] influenced by the context and the
[00:04:22] purpose with which you're learning it.
[00:04:23] So if you're learning just trying to hit
[00:04:26] your current requirements and your
[00:04:28] current level, then yes, you will be
[00:04:30] able to reach that current level, but
[00:04:33] 90% of the value of that learning is
[00:04:36] going to end there. But you can bet that
[00:04:38] that same piece of information, if you
[00:04:40] were to ask an expert about it, they
[00:04:42] would know even deeper and more nuance.
[00:04:45] It may not be new information that you
[00:04:47] haven't learned, but it's a way of
[00:04:49] seeing that information that the
[00:04:51] beginner normally can't see. And so if
[00:04:53] you're setting your sights on trying to
[00:04:55] develop that higher level of expertise,
[00:04:58] being the expert, not just following
[00:05:00] along everyone else, but becoming the
[00:05:02] leader within your level, then not only
[00:05:04] will you hit your current requirements,
[00:05:06] but because you are thinking like an
[00:05:09] expert, the way that that knowledge is
[00:05:11] consolidated into your brain is going to
[00:05:13] be closer to that of an expert. So it's
[00:05:16] actually going to carry you to the next
[00:05:18] level and beyond. And trust me, when you
[00:05:21] are tackling a new topic or a new client
[00:05:24] or a new project and you have learned
[00:05:26] about it and the way you contribute and
[00:05:29] the questions you ask and the way you
[00:05:31] think about it is way beyond your
[00:05:33] current level, people will notice.
[00:05:36] Number four, write less. You are not a
[00:05:39] human photocopier and words on paper
[00:05:43] don't mean anything. Back when you're a
[00:05:45] student, some of you may have taken a
[00:05:48] lot of pride in writing lots of really
[00:05:49] nice, pretty comprehensive notes. But
[00:05:51] what you will probably quickly realize
[00:05:53] in a professional learning environment
[00:05:54] is that writing a lot of notes takes a
[00:05:56] lot of time and doesn't really provide
[00:05:58] much benefit. Learning is not about
[00:06:01] writing notes. Writing notes is a tool
[00:06:05] to help you think so that you can do the
[00:06:09] learning. The learning happens in the
[00:06:10] brain. And if you're learning in the
[00:06:12] right way, you're constantly comparing
[00:06:14] and contrasting the new things that
[00:06:16] you've learned with other new things
[00:06:17] you've learned or with existing
[00:06:19] knowledge you have. You're constantly
[00:06:21] trying to make analogies. You're
[00:06:22] constantly trying to simplify what
[00:06:24] you're learning. That is a constant
[00:06:27] active process that should be going on
[00:06:29] in your brain. And it's hard to keep
[00:06:31] track of all of these thoughts if you
[00:06:33] just do it mentally. That's why you use
[00:06:36] notetaking. It is a cognitive offload
[00:06:40] mechanism. And so when you look at your
[00:06:42] notes, it should be like a visual
[00:06:45] representation of your thought process.
[00:06:48] And any adjustment you make to your note
[00:06:50] takingaking method that gets you closer
[00:06:52] to this onetoone match with your thought
[00:06:55] process and how your brain is trying to
[00:06:57] organize that information, the more
[00:06:59] effective your learning is going to be.
[00:07:01] And therefore, naturally, you'll feel
[00:07:03] that you need to write less notes. And
[00:07:05] this logic also directly applies for the
[00:07:06] next tip which is don't memorize.
[00:07:10] Learning through memorization is a
[00:07:12] losing game. You don't there's no way to
[00:07:15] win this. The more you try to memorize
[00:07:18] and learn through repetition, the less
[00:07:21] efficient your learning is going to be
[00:07:23] overall. There is going to be some
[00:07:25] information that you do need to
[00:07:27] memorize. You can't avoid it. Especially
[00:07:28] if you are in a lot of scientific
[00:07:30] disciplines or really technically uh
[00:07:32] heavy disciplines. So when I was a
[00:07:34] doctor, yes, there was lots of things
[00:07:35] that I had to memorize. But what you
[00:07:37] need to understand is that memorization
[00:07:39] is a method of learning when all other
[00:07:42] methods of learning are not applicable.
[00:07:44] It is the process of your brain
[00:07:46] receiving information that it doesn't
[00:07:48] connect with, doesn't see the relevance
[00:07:50] of, doesn't know why it's important,
[00:07:52] doesn't know why it needs to keep it,
[00:07:54] and therefore tries to remove it and
[00:07:56] prune it from your memory because that's
[00:07:58] what it's meant to do. and then you
[00:08:01] taking it and then ramming it back into
[00:08:03] your brain to say, "No, I need you to
[00:08:05] hold on to this." And with enough
[00:08:07] repetition, it does actually work. You
[00:08:10] can deepen this neural groove so that
[00:08:13] that information just stays there
[00:08:15] stickier. But this requires repetition
[00:08:18] and is very timeconuming if you're
[00:08:19] trying to do this at scale. In the first
[00:08:21] instance of learning new information,
[00:08:23] your primary objective should be how can
[00:08:26] I learn this in such a way that I don't
[00:08:28] need to memorize it. How do I make it
[00:08:30] simpler, inherently more intuitive, more
[00:08:34] relevant? How can I find a way to apply
[00:08:35] it and consolidate it straight away? And
[00:08:38] the biggest barrier I see when coaching
[00:08:40] people is that they are so used to
[00:08:41] learning through memorization that
[00:08:44] they're not even aware that they're
[00:08:45] trying to memorize it. Whenever you hear
[00:08:47] something or you're reading something
[00:08:50] and you go into this loop of thinking,
[00:08:52] I'm going to forget this. So, let me
[00:08:55] repeat that again and again to try to
[00:08:57] consolidate it into my memory. That
[00:09:00] behavior, that thought process is you
[00:09:03] trying to memorize. So start building a
[00:09:05] a radar, an awareness of when you enter
[00:09:08] into that habit and then use that as an
[00:09:10] opportunity to say, okay, instead of
[00:09:12] just repeating it again and again, maybe
[00:09:14] I just pause for a moment and just think
[00:09:15] about how I can connect it to something
[00:09:18] or simplify it so that it's easier to
[00:09:20] remember. Now, one thing I need to
[00:09:22] mention is that even though I'm
[00:09:24] packaging this information as a bunch of
[00:09:27] tips, learning to learn is a messy
[00:09:30] process. Some people watch my videos and
[00:09:32] they assume that because they watched
[00:09:34] it, they will magically get better at
[00:09:35] learning. But if you are serious about
[00:09:38] getting better, you cannot avoid putting
[00:09:41] in the time and effort to try things,
[00:09:44] make mistakes, and learn from them.
[00:09:46] Personally, it took me over 7 years of
[00:09:48] constant trial and error and reading
[00:09:51] thousands of research articles. And
[00:09:52] those years of experience are what have
[00:09:54] allowed me to make YouTube videos like
[00:09:56] this today. But if you're a busy
[00:09:59] professional trying to become
[00:10:01] hyperefficient at learning, you probably
[00:10:04] don't have a spare seven years. This is
[00:10:06] why I created the I can study program on
[00:10:09] YouTube. I try my best to give you
[00:10:12] content and valuable information, but
[00:10:16] there is a lot to go through and if you
[00:10:18] want to improve quickly, you need to be
[00:10:20] focused on what to do next rather than
[00:10:23] what video should I watch next. On the I
[00:10:26] can study program, I'm able to distill
[00:10:28] my years of experience into the ideal
[00:10:31] order and structure. I can give you
[00:10:33] tasks and check your understanding and
[00:10:35] give you feedback. I can go into
[00:10:37] examples and walkthroughs for your
[00:10:39] specific goals. So, while I will keep
[00:10:41] posting videos for free on YouTube, if
[00:10:44] you are interested in a faster, more
[00:10:47] guided, less confusing path to
[00:10:49] improvement, you may be interested in
[00:10:51] checking out my program at
[00:10:53] iconstudy.com. If you'd like to explore
[00:10:54] it, I'll leave a link to it in the
[00:10:56] description below. And we'll move on to
[00:10:58] the next tip, which is actually one of
[00:11:00] the first lessons in the program as
[00:11:01] well, which is to prep everything. Think
[00:11:04] about your brain's ability to learn like
[00:11:07] a physical muscle. If I give you like a
[00:11:10] potato to carry, that's not going to be
[00:11:12] very difficult. But if I'm constantly
[00:11:14] throwing potatoes at you and now you've
[00:11:17] got like you've got this sack of
[00:11:19] potatoes and you're constantly trying to
[00:11:20] catch more and hold this huge heavy sack
[00:11:24] of potatoes, you're going to get very
[00:11:25] tired. And the exact same thing happens
[00:11:27] with our learning except instead of
[00:11:28] muscular fatigue, we're going to enter
[00:11:30] into cognitive fatigue or cognitive
[00:11:33] overload. And so the trick to learning
[00:11:35] efficiently is to balance our cognitive
[00:11:38] resources. That's basically how much
[00:11:40] mental energy and strength that we have.
[00:11:42] And so if you imagine that you are in
[00:11:44] some workshop or a seminar and you're
[00:11:47] listening to someone give you this large
[00:11:49] volume of very dense information that
[00:11:51] you have never been exposed to before.
[00:11:53] Your brain is trying to process that,
[00:11:55] understand it, organize it in your brain
[00:11:58] while simultaneously receiving the next
[00:12:00] piece of information. And it's trying to
[00:12:02] juggle so many things at the same time.
[00:12:04] And if that's the situation you're in,
[00:12:06] it's pretty much impossible to make your
[00:12:09] learning more efficient except using
[00:12:11] some very cognitively advanced
[00:12:13] techniques. So when I say prep
[00:12:15] everything, what I mean is to take that
[00:12:18] big block of learning and to start
[00:12:21] chipping away and working at it in
[00:12:23] advance. And you can spend just five to
[00:12:26] 10 minutes just generally familiarizing
[00:12:30] yourself with what the main ideas are
[00:12:32] going to be about what you're learning,
[00:12:34] what some of the more complicated ideas
[00:12:36] might be, and just generally how it's
[00:12:38] all connected and why you need to know
[00:12:41] this, why it is important for you. and
[00:12:44] how it's going to be relevant for you.
[00:12:45] And it doesn't take very long to get a
[00:12:47] general familiarity and a sense of
[00:12:49] purpose with what you're about to learn.
[00:12:52] And that means that when you learn that
[00:12:54] information, your brain isn't trying to
[00:12:56] process and understand it and then
[00:12:58] desperately try to figure out where it
[00:13:00] fits all at the same time. It has an
[00:13:03] idea about where this information will
[00:13:05] fit. And so, it's easier and faster to
[00:13:08] store it away. Spending just 10 minutes
[00:13:10] to prep yourself on what you're about to
[00:13:12] learn can save you literally 10 times
[00:13:16] that amount of time and effort in the
[00:13:18] future. Having said that, one of the
[00:13:21] most common ways that you can ruin the
[00:13:24] benefit of that preparation is to
[00:13:27] overconume information. Which brings me
[00:13:30] to the next tip. Don't overeat. Learning
[00:13:34] is essentially this constant battle of
[00:13:36] consuming and digesting. You're
[00:13:39] consuming new information and your brain
[00:13:41] is digesting it. Figuring out how to
[00:13:43] organize and store this into your
[00:13:45] memory. The figuring out and storing
[00:13:48] part of this process takes a lot of
[00:13:50] effort and there's a limit to how fast
[00:13:52] you can do this. This is the bottleneck.
[00:13:55] It's very easy to consume a lot of very
[00:13:58] dense information very quickly just like
[00:14:01] how I actually realized in the last few
[00:14:03] years that I tend to stress binge eat
[00:14:07] and I didn't even know what overeing
[00:14:10] actually meant. Uh and I'm working on
[00:14:12] that now. You may also not know what it
[00:14:15] actually means to over consume and
[00:14:17] overeat new information. So, here is the
[00:14:20] mental check that I use every time I'm
[00:14:24] learning something new that makes sure I
[00:14:26] never overeat. There are two questions I
[00:14:28] am constantly asking myself while I'm
[00:14:29] learning new information. The first is,
[00:14:32] does this make sense to me? Not just do
[00:14:35] I understand it, but do I actually feel
[00:14:38] like it makes sense? It makes sense
[00:14:41] because that pattern of connections is
[00:14:44] something that your brain feels
[00:14:45] comfortable and familiar with. The
[00:14:47] second question is, do I feel like I'm
[00:14:49] about to forget this? This question is
[00:14:52] bringing our attention to a very similar
[00:14:54] and important cognitive phenomenon. When
[00:14:56] we have too many things that don't make
[00:14:58] sense, where our brain doesn't know how
[00:15:00] to organize it and file it away, then
[00:15:03] it's going to prune that information out
[00:15:06] of our memory. And so that feeling of I
[00:15:09] feel like I'm going to forget this means
[00:15:12] that your brain has not found a
[00:15:14] worthwhile and meaningful way of
[00:15:17] organizing this information. And if
[00:15:18] there's lots of information you've
[00:15:20] consumed in a in a short period of time,
[00:15:22] your brain will probably struggle to get
[00:15:24] meaning out of it because it's
[00:15:26] overloaded. It's holding a very big sack
[00:15:29] of potatoes. And so in that situation
[00:15:31] where you feel like either it doesn't
[00:15:32] make sense or you're about to forget it
[00:15:34] or both, the most important thing you
[00:15:36] can do is to stop eating. Put the potato
[00:15:39] chip down. You don't have to, Justin.
[00:15:42] Just because you opened up a bag of
[00:15:43] chips doesn't mean you have to finish
[00:15:45] it. You need to give your brain the
[00:15:46] space to just process what it's already
[00:15:49] consumed. This is where note-taking in a
[00:15:52] way that reflects your thinking process
[00:15:54] can really help. You write down what
[00:15:56] you're thinking. You track your thoughts
[00:15:57] and you use that note-taking to help you
[00:15:59] to organize, group and simplify this
[00:16:02] information. Now, how long it takes, how
[00:16:05] long you need to pause for for this to
[00:16:07] be
[00:16:08] consolidated, this can be minutes,
[00:16:11] seconds, or even hours or days depending
[00:16:14] on your skill level and the amount of
[00:16:16] practice you have as well as the
[00:16:18] complexity of the information and how
[00:16:20] much knowledge you already have about
[00:16:21] the subject. But I can guarantee that if
[00:16:24] you keep overeing and it doesn't make
[00:16:26] sense and you feel like you're going to
[00:16:27] forget it, then you the only thing
[00:16:30] you'll be able to do when you overeat is
[00:16:32] vomit it back up. You won't be able to
[00:16:35] use that information probably for the
[00:16:36] reasons you're trying to learn it in the
[00:16:38] first place. And like I said, one of the
[00:16:39] things that really helps you with this
[00:16:41] is tip number eight, map everything. The
[00:16:44] human brain is vastly more efficient at
[00:16:49] processing visual information than
[00:16:51] written information. Some studies
[00:16:53] suggest 20 to 40,000 times faster. This
[00:16:57] is why you can look at a painting of
[00:16:59] something and understand what you're
[00:17:00] seeing in half a second when it might
[00:17:03] take you half an hour to read a detailed
[00:17:06] description of everything that you saw.
[00:17:08] Well, if you want to get more efficient
[00:17:09] with learning, you have to develop the
[00:17:11] habit of visually representing what you
[00:17:16] are thinking about in your notes. Like
[00:17:18] I've mentioned, the brain works in
[00:17:20] connections. It forms networks of
[00:17:22] knowledge that are all connected to and
[00:17:24] influence each other. And when
[00:17:26] information doesn't fit into this
[00:17:28] network somewhere, it is eventually lost
[00:17:30] and forgotten. It is your ability to put
[00:17:33] something into a network and connect
[00:17:35] that meaningfully that determines your
[00:17:38] attention and your depth of expertise
[00:17:41] aka how you can apply that information.
[00:17:43] As a professional, most of the things
[00:17:45] you are learning, you're expected to do
[00:17:47] something with. Everything you learn is
[00:17:50] connected to something and it is your
[00:17:52] job as a learner to figure out what
[00:17:54] those connections are. and mapping
[00:17:57] nonlinear notetaking. Actually
[00:18:00] physically representing connections and
[00:18:03] flows and influences on paper as you
[00:18:07] learn is an incredibly powerful
[00:18:09] technique that can help your brain to
[00:18:11] think of and see these connections. And
[00:18:13] if you've tried mapping and note-taking
[00:18:15] before and you haven't found it very
[00:18:17] effective, then I can
[00:18:19] guarantee it's not because the map is
[00:18:22] not effective. It's because the way you
[00:18:25] are thinking as you make the map is not
[00:18:28] effective. And so one key tip to make
[00:18:31] this more effective is to judge
[00:18:35] everything. The value of each new piece
[00:18:38] of information you learn is not always
[00:18:42] equal. Some things are more important
[00:18:44] than other things. Some things are
[00:18:46] important in one context and less
[00:18:48] important than another context. And the
[00:18:50] reason something is important is usually
[00:18:51] because of the influence or impact it
[00:18:54] has on another piece of information.
[00:18:57] This is the network. A great learner
[00:19:00] doesn't just organize information based
[00:19:02] on how someone tells them to organize
[00:19:05] it. They actively think about why this
[00:19:09] piece of information is important. They
[00:19:11] judge and critique the information. And
[00:19:15] sometimes this is how you gain a
[00:19:17] perspective on knowledge that is
[00:19:19] uncommon amongst your peers. Where your
[00:19:21] peers can say, "Oh yeah, this thing is
[00:19:24] made up of A, B, and C." But you can
[00:19:27] talk about it as, "Yeah, this thing is
[00:19:29] made up of A, B, and C, but really the
[00:19:31] most important thing is B because of the
[00:19:34] influence it has on A and C." And you
[00:19:36] can immediately tell that the second
[00:19:37] person has thought about it more and
[00:19:40] understands the topic to a deeper level.
[00:19:43] In fact, even if you don't make a map or
[00:19:47] create a network or do any of the other
[00:19:48] things, simply just asking yourself on a
[00:19:52] scale of 1 to 10, how important do I
[00:19:56] think this piece of information I've
[00:19:58] just consumed is? Just asking yourself
[00:20:00] that question can have immediate impacts
[00:20:03] on your attention and your depth of
[00:20:04] understanding. And one of the best parts
[00:20:06] about judging everything and getting
[00:20:08] into that habit is that allows you to do
[00:20:11] the next tip, which is to ask better
[00:20:15] questions. There's no such thing as a
[00:20:17] stupid question. Sure. But there are
[00:20:20] definitely some questions that are
[00:20:22] better than others for learning. And the
[00:20:24] best questions that help you to hold on
[00:20:27] to information, make sense of
[00:20:29] information, and use that information
[00:20:31] like an expert would. that helps you to
[00:20:34] be a leader and not a follower is when
[00:20:37] you are asking questions that help you
[00:20:40] to map and judge the information. Let's
[00:20:44] say you learn two new facts and you're
[00:20:46] trying to decide which of these two
[00:20:48] facts are more important and in what
[00:20:51] situations and how do they connect to
[00:20:54] each other? How can I map it? You can
[00:20:56] see that trying to do that, trying to
[00:21:00] achieve that outcome of judging it and
[00:21:02] mapping it forces you to think about
[00:21:05] this information more deeply and in
[00:21:07] relation to another. You might have
[00:21:09] understood each thing
[00:21:11] individually. I understand what this
[00:21:13] concept means. I understand what this
[00:21:14] concept means. But when you start
[00:21:16] comparing, well, which one is more
[00:21:18] important? How does it influence each
[00:21:20] other? It's a whole new realm of
[00:21:22] thinking. And naturally, if it's a new
[00:21:24] topic, you may have questions. You will
[00:21:27] have
[00:21:28] hypothesis. I think this is more
[00:21:32] important in this situation because I
[00:21:34] feel like it impacts this and this and
[00:21:36] you know whereas I feel like this one is
[00:21:38] more important in a different situation
[00:21:39] because I feel like it connects with
[00:21:41] this thing and this thing but not this
[00:21:42] thing. You can see these are hypotheses
[00:21:45] and to clarify those, we ask questions
[00:21:48] and depending on your your situation,
[00:21:50] you know, where you ask that question
[00:21:51] might depend. Maybe you leave it on a
[00:21:54] separate notepad and you go over it
[00:21:55] later in your in your own time in the
[00:21:57] evening. Maybe you do a Google search.
[00:21:59] Maybe you ask a supervisor or a manager
[00:22:01] or a senior. And not only does asking
[00:22:04] and then answering these questions help
[00:22:06] with your learning and help you reach
[00:22:07] that expert level, if you are in a
[00:22:10] situation where questions are welcomed
[00:22:12] and encouraged, then your supervisor or
[00:22:14] your manager or even your client is
[00:22:17] going to be impressed at how deeply
[00:22:20] you're trying to think about this topic
[00:22:22] and the types of questions that you're
[00:22:23] asking. If I'm working with someone and
[00:22:26] I know it's complicated and it's new to
[00:22:28] them and they don't have any questions
[00:22:31] for
[00:22:32] me, almost always that's a red flag. It
[00:22:37] means that they're not even thinking
[00:22:38] about it at the level that they need to
[00:22:41] to have these questions pop up into
[00:22:43] their heads. And if I know there's a
[00:22:44] certain standard that they need to hit
[00:22:46] and they're also not even thinking at
[00:22:49] that
[00:22:50] standard, then there's almost no chance
[00:22:52] they're going to hit it. On the flip
[00:22:53] side, if someone is asking me questions
[00:22:56] that shows that they're thinking at this
[00:22:58] level, then nine out of 10 times I know
[00:23:01] that the outcome, the quality of the
[00:23:02] work that they produce is going to be
[00:23:04] excellent. By the way, if you're liking
[00:23:05] this and you want me to go even deeper
[00:23:07] and explore some of the nuances and
[00:23:09] variations of these techniques that took
[00:23:12] me over a decade to figure out, then I
[00:23:14] want to mention that I also have a free
[00:23:16] weekly newsletter where I cover that.
[00:23:19] You can find a link to that in the
[00:23:21] description below. Now, on to the next
[00:23:24] tip. Number 11, tactically hit the
[00:23:27] books. When you go from high school to
[00:23:30] university, there's a big shift in that
[00:23:32] you take a lot more independence and
[00:23:34] responsibility. You decide how to study,
[00:23:38] when to study, or whether to study at
[00:23:40] all. When you go from uni to the
[00:23:43] workforce, there's another transition in
[00:23:45] that you now decide what to study in the
[00:23:49] first place. And so when you think about
[00:23:51] studying and having dedicated study
[00:23:53] sessions, think about studying as your
[00:23:57] fourth optimal solution to a knowledge
[00:24:01] problem. So if you need to know
[00:24:03] something for work or for an exam, the
[00:24:08] first option like the most ideal
[00:24:10] solution to that problem, the knowledge
[00:24:12] gap that you have is that you just know
[00:24:16] it and you can just remember it. there
[00:24:17] was a gap, you thought about a little
[00:24:19] bit more and it's like, oh yeah, now you
[00:24:20] filled it. The second option is that you
[00:24:22] just quickly look it up. A quick Google
[00:24:24] search, looking through notes, looking
[00:24:26] at a reference piece of information and
[00:24:28] the knowledge is there. The third option
[00:24:30] is that you can't find the information
[00:24:32] quickly. So, you have to do a deeper
[00:24:34] search. It takes you a little bit longer
[00:24:35] to find the answer. You're crawling
[00:24:37] through reading like dozens of different
[00:24:40] uh Google results. You're reading
[00:24:42] through articles trying to figure this
[00:24:43] out. And the fourth option is when you
[00:24:45] have to do that deeper finding. It's
[00:24:48] timeconuming. You have to troll through
[00:24:50] things. However, it's not enough just to
[00:24:52] have found an answer. It's when you not
[00:24:55] only have to have an answer, but you
[00:24:57] also need to know how to think about the
[00:24:58] answer and how to think about the
[00:25:00] problem and all the other things that
[00:25:01] are related to it. You actually have to
[00:25:03] have expertise on the topic. And in
[00:25:05] order to achieve that, you need to do
[00:25:08] studying. And the reason this tip is
[00:25:10] called tactically hit the books is
[00:25:12] because a very common thing that I see
[00:25:14] is that people will have this general
[00:25:17] knowledge gap within their discipline.
[00:25:19] And so they'll find like a book or a
[00:25:22] course that fills it and then they'll
[00:25:24] just go through it. And it is a very
[00:25:27] passive and inefficient and undirected
[00:25:30] way of trying to fill that knowledge
[00:25:33] gap. Some of the information isn't even
[00:25:34] relevant to what you need and then you
[00:25:36] have to sift through what is and isn't
[00:25:37] relevant. It's often very timeconuming
[00:25:39] and feels very boring and tedious like
[00:25:41] you know going back to school and then
[00:25:44] because it's not a targeted way of
[00:25:45] filling your knowledge gap. It's not
[00:25:47] providing you value for your daily work
[00:25:50] straight away. You have to spend 3 weeks
[00:25:52] finishing this course before you then
[00:25:54] turn around and think okay did this help
[00:25:57] solve my problem? But if instead you
[00:25:59] think about the process of studying as
[00:26:01] almost like this fourth option like this
[00:26:04] really slow Google search then it means
[00:26:07] you are much more deliberate about what
[00:26:10] you are trying to learn and why you're
[00:26:12] trying to learn it. What information do
[00:26:14] you need to solve your knowledge gap and
[00:26:16] how do you need to think about it for
[00:26:17] this to be valuable? And if you start
[00:26:19] here in a more targeted way then it's
[00:26:22] easier to make this knowledge relevant.
[00:26:24] It's easier to make it make sense. It's
[00:26:26] more memorable naturally. It provides
[00:26:28] you value straight away. And even if you
[00:26:31] do go on and then study all the other
[00:26:34] little details that may be less
[00:26:36] relevant, it's easier to learn and
[00:26:38] integrate that stuff later because
[00:26:40] you're building on this solid foundation
[00:26:44] of relevant material that makes sense to
[00:26:47] you. And one thing that you should do to
[00:26:48] try to make the knowledge that you gain
[00:26:50] from hitting the books more relevant
[00:26:52] more quickly is to delete the latent
[00:26:56] learning period. If you studying in uni,
[00:27:00] you might spend six weeks studying
[00:27:01] something and then have an exam and then
[00:27:04] in that exam you see how well you did.
[00:27:06] Well, this is actually a very risky
[00:27:08] studying strategy because it means that
[00:27:09] if you've got gaps in your knowledge and
[00:27:11] you weren't hitting the level, you don't
[00:27:13] figure that out until the exam. So a
[00:27:15] good student should be testing
[00:27:17] themselves very regularly. So it's their
[00:27:19] exam result is not a surprise to them.
[00:27:21] Well, this is even more true if you're
[00:27:23] learning as a professional. Forget 6
[00:27:25] weeks. If you spend 6 days learning
[00:27:27] about something, preparing some
[00:27:29] solution, some strategy, solving a
[00:27:31] certain problem at work, but the way
[00:27:33] that you've approached it and what
[00:27:35] you've learned has not been accurate,
[00:27:36] hasn't been correct, then you've just
[00:27:39] wasted that entire week and that time
[00:27:41] and probably someone else's time and
[00:27:43] money. And so that period from when you
[00:27:46] start learning something through to the
[00:27:48] point at which you start getting
[00:27:50] feedback on the validity of what you
[00:27:53] have learned, that's called the latent
[00:27:54] learning period. And as a professional,
[00:27:57] we want to bring that as close to zero
[00:27:59] as possible. For a new and especially
[00:28:02] complicated topic, it can be very
[00:28:04] difficult to know what even is the
[00:28:06] correct or right way of thinking about
[00:28:08] it. And so we want to test the validity
[00:28:11] of how we're thinking and structuring
[00:28:13] this information very frequently. Go
[00:28:16] from learning about it, making sense of
[00:28:18] it, connecting it together, and then
[00:28:20] proposing, okay, this is how I think I
[00:28:22] should apply it. And try to do that
[00:28:25] immediately. And then have that approach
[00:28:28] or strategy checked by someone early and
[00:28:31] frequently. If there are major errors in
[00:28:33] the way that you're thinking about
[00:28:34] something or learning something, you
[00:28:36] want those to be signposted to you as
[00:28:38] early as possible so you don't have to
[00:28:40] then restructure your entire schema of
[00:28:43] learning. But in reality, when I do
[00:28:44] these workshops and I talk to these
[00:28:47] professionals that I'm coaching, they'll
[00:28:49] spend weeks learning about something and
[00:28:52] only weeks or months later when they
[00:28:55] actually apply it in a real world
[00:28:57] setting at work do they realize that the
[00:29:00] way they learned it isn't actually
[00:29:02] helpful for their needs. And by having
[00:29:04] this weeks or months long latent
[00:29:07] learning period, we've just wasted all
[00:29:10] of that time. And speaking of wasting
[00:29:13] time, one of the most important things
[00:29:15] that you can do to save time when
[00:29:17] learning is to actually learn more
[00:29:20] slowly. Because tip number 13, slow is
[00:29:25] fast. This general manager of this
[00:29:27] company that I worked with once told me
[00:29:29] that good planning costs a lot, but not
[00:29:34] planning costs much more. And I find
[00:29:36] that this is really true for learning.
[00:29:39] When we don't have a lot of time and
[00:29:40] there's so much to learn, it's really
[00:29:43] easy to want to learn faster and just
[00:29:47] cover more content and overeat and just
[00:29:51] just do whatever we can to get on top of
[00:29:53] this knowledge gap. So you end up
[00:29:55] reading a lot of books and attending
[00:29:58] courses and and and workshops and you
[00:30:01] know listening to a bunch of different
[00:30:02] podcasts and audio books and all you
[00:30:05] have is just more things that you're
[00:30:09] forgetting. And the trap is that it
[00:30:12] becomes so easy to get caught up in just
[00:30:17] going through more material
[00:30:19] quickly that we
[00:30:21] deprioritize actually spending the time
[00:30:25] to think and process and organize what
[00:30:28] we've consumed. the idea of learning in
[00:30:31] sprints and consuming and then just not
[00:30:35] consuming anything else, just applying
[00:30:38] and consolidating and checking and and
[00:30:40] living through that. This is a very
[00:30:44] confronting suggestion to a lot of
[00:30:46] people who would say, well, if I do
[00:30:48] that, I'm not going to be able to cover
[00:30:50] my knowledge requirements because I'm
[00:30:52] not getting through enough content
[00:30:54] quickly. And my answer is that if the
[00:30:56] problem is with the knowledge you have
[00:31:00] in your brain, then flicking more pages
[00:31:03] with your hands doesn't change that. And
[00:31:06] sometimes what we need to think more is
[00:31:11] to give ourselves the space by flicking
[00:31:14] pages a little less. I would say that I
[00:31:17] am a very efficient, fast
[00:31:20] learner. You would hope so cuz it's my
[00:31:22] literal job. But when you watch me
[00:31:26] study, it's not I'm not blazing fast. My
[00:31:29] pen isn't catching fire, you know? I'm
[00:31:30] not breaking through my keyboard every
[00:31:32] study session because I'm just like
[00:31:34] studying so fast. Most of the time when
[00:31:37] I'm learning something, I'm doing a lot
[00:31:39] of just looking, thinking, pondering,
[00:31:43] maybe a Google search. Mentally, there's
[00:31:46] a lot going on and it's very quick. What
[00:31:48] I'm focused on is fixing the biggest
[00:31:51] bottleneck, which is my ability to
[00:31:53] process and organize the information.
[00:31:55] I'm acknowledging that it doesn't matter
[00:31:58] how fast I consume. The consuming
[00:32:01] information part is never the
[00:32:02] bottleneck. I can always do that faster
[00:32:04] or slower. The thing that affects my
[00:32:07] speed of learning is how much time and
[00:32:10] effort I devote into the thinking and
[00:32:12] processing part. And sometimes that can
[00:32:15] make it feel like you're learning very
[00:32:18] slowly if you are used to measuring your
[00:32:21] speed of learning by how quickly you're
[00:32:24] covering content. But if you are
[00:32:26] learning correctly, thinking in the
[00:32:28] right ways, it should take more effort
[00:32:30] and it should take a little longer. And
[00:32:34] that's what saves you time in the
[00:32:36] future. Going slow and doing it properly
[00:32:40] is what makes your learning fast. And
[00:32:43] the final tip I have for you is to bring
[00:32:45] everything to the table. One of my
[00:32:47] employees is also one of my former
[00:32:49] students. They joined my program. They
[00:32:52] learned the skills. They did very well
[00:32:55] academically. We hired him and there was
[00:32:59] this big difference between his ability
[00:33:01] to perform academically which is very
[00:33:04] high versus his ability to perform at
[00:33:07] work. And what we eventually realized
[00:33:09] was that these skills of thinking
[00:33:12] critically and connecting everything and
[00:33:15] judging everything and mapping
[00:33:16] everything, he wasn't holding himself to
[00:33:19] that standard consistently with his
[00:33:22] work. He was only doing that when it
[00:33:24] came to studying something. But the key
[00:33:27] to being an exceptional professional, to
[00:33:31] being a thought leader, to being someone
[00:33:33] who's able to just learn and just adapt
[00:33:35] and tackle projects with confidence, is
[00:33:38] that your brain needs to get used to
[00:33:41] thinking at this higher standard. It has
[00:33:44] to get used to it so that it can become
[00:33:46] a habit so that it can become easier and
[00:33:48] faster. You don't want to need to like
[00:33:51] take a quadruple shot of espresso every
[00:33:54] single time you sit down to do some work
[00:33:56] because your brain is just like having
[00:33:58] to think so hard to think at this level.
[00:34:01] With enough practice, it just becomes a
[00:34:04] habit. It becomes as easy to think in
[00:34:06] this way as whatever way you're
[00:34:09] currently thinking of. Now, it takes
[00:34:11] time and it takes effort to get to that
[00:34:13] point, but that's where your goal should
[00:34:15] be. And if on a Monday you're thinking
[00:34:17] at a lower level and then on a Tuesday
[00:34:19] you're thinking at a higher level and on
[00:34:20] a Wednesday you are back low, this tug
[00:34:23] of war is going to make it harder for
[00:34:25] you to just consistently build this
[00:34:26] habit. So show up every day holding
[00:34:30] yourself to this standard. Every meeting
[00:34:33] you're a part of, every conversation,
[00:34:34] every problem you're solving, do your
[00:34:37] best to think and maintain this standard
[00:34:39] for yourself. become the person who's
[00:34:43] valuable to involve in the conversation
[00:34:45] purely because the way they think about
[00:34:47] it is valuable. And when you bring
[00:34:49] everything you can to the table
[00:34:52] consistently, not only does it help you
[00:34:54] to train your brain with these new
[00:34:56] habits, but you become someone who is
[00:34:58] more dependable, who is capable of more,
[00:35:01] is given more responsibilities and given
[00:35:03] more opportunities. So that's the advice
[00:35:05] and I can tell you that in the hundreds
[00:35:08] of professionals that I've done face tof
[00:35:10] face workshops for all around the world
[00:35:12] that the number of people that follow
[00:35:14] even half of this advice is extremely
[00:35:16] rare. And if you do follow all of this
[00:35:19] advice, your ability to learn, your
[00:35:23] growth trajectory, your career
[00:35:24] trajectory will tangibly improve. So I
[00:35:27] hope you found this useful. If there are
[00:35:29] certain situations that you want me to
[00:35:30] cover or questions you want me to
[00:35:31] answer, leave a comment down below. So,
[00:35:33] if you're interested in joining my
[00:35:34] program to get a fast track on
[00:35:36] developing these skills, there's also a
[00:35:38] link to that in the description below.
[00:35:39] Thank you so much for watching and I'll
[00:35:41] see you in the next one.


=== How to Learn ANYTHING Faster Than Everyone ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOjSJVaBV94

[00:00:00] In this video, I'm going to show you how
[00:00:01] you can learn anything faster than
[00:00:04] everyone else. I do this by sharing
[00:00:06] three powerful learning principles that
[00:00:08] helped me graduate from my masters
[00:00:10] program at the top of my class while
[00:00:12] studying less than 10% of the time as my
[00:00:15] peers. These principles have worked not
[00:00:16] only for me, but also for the over
[00:00:18] 30,000 learners that I've coached over
[00:00:21] the past 13 years, which means they will
[00:00:23] work for you, too. And these principles
[00:00:25] are number one the effort time
[00:00:29] exchange number two the omniarner
[00:00:32] principle and number three the iteration
[00:00:36] effect. So let's start with number one
[00:00:37] the effort time exchange. So if you
[00:00:40] imagine becoming a faster learner than
[00:00:42] anyone else it probably means that for
[00:00:45] you learning is much easier. It's much
[00:00:47] more comfortable. You can do it without
[00:00:48] even thinking. What most people do to
[00:00:51] try to become a faster learner is that
[00:00:53] they find ways to reduce the amount of
[00:00:55] effort that they need to spend on
[00:00:58] learning. And the idea is if I can make
[00:01:00] learning easier and require less effort,
[00:01:03] this should mean that I can then also
[00:01:04] spend less time and therefore I'm
[00:01:06] faster. Except when it comes to
[00:01:08] learning, this is almost always wrong.
[00:01:10] The learning happens in the brain and
[00:01:12] your brain has to actively think about
[00:01:14] and process the information that you're
[00:01:16] learning to gain learning and memory out
[00:01:19] of it. When you avoid the hard difficult
[00:01:22] thinking associated with learning, you
[00:01:25] are avoiding the learning itself. And
[00:01:27] this can actually be really confusing
[00:01:28] because when we're learning something,
[00:01:30] we're also using some kind of technique.
[00:01:32] For example, we might be writing notes.
[00:01:35] And the process of writing really good
[00:01:36] notes might take time and it might take
[00:01:38] a lot of effort. And so we say, well, if
[00:01:40] I use some kind of AI, it might be able
[00:01:43] to do it for me faster. And now I don't
[00:01:45] have to put in any effort and the notes
[00:01:47] are made for me. And what's happened is
[00:01:49] that we've actually confused the goal.
[00:01:51] The purpose of writing the notes was to
[00:01:53] achieve the learning which happens in
[00:01:54] our brain, not to just have notes. And
[00:01:58] so the sneaky trap that you need to be
[00:02:00] careful about is that when we reduce the
[00:02:02] amount of effort to do a task, it makes
[00:02:04] it faster to achieve the task. for
[00:02:07] example, writing a set of notes. We can
[00:02:10] achieve that faster in less time, but
[00:02:14] we're actually
[00:02:15] delaying and increasing the amount of
[00:02:18] time it would take for us to achieve the
[00:02:20] learning. And so, as effort goes down,
[00:02:23] we pay for that effort with more and
[00:02:26] more time later on. And so, the way to
[00:02:29] really become a faster learner is to put
[00:02:33] that effort up front. buy back more time
[00:02:36] for yourself using effort. So actively
[00:02:39] find ways to increase the amount of
[00:02:42] effort while you're learning something
[00:02:45] which makes the learning process also
[00:02:47] more effective which means that your
[00:02:49] memory is going to be stronger. Your
[00:02:51] understanding is going to be deeper and
[00:02:53] you're achieving that earlier on. And so
[00:02:56] you don't have to spend more time later
[00:02:58] to try to hit that goal cuz you already
[00:03:00] hit it. And ultimately this is what
[00:03:03] saves you time. In the research, this
[00:03:06] concept of thinking harder and doing
[00:03:08] more active thinking to generate more
[00:03:11] effective learning is called the
[00:03:13] generation effect. And the research
[00:03:15] consistently shows that people that use
[00:03:17] this generation effect are able to
[00:03:19] achieve a better retention on what they
[00:03:20] learn and a deeper understanding in a
[00:03:22] shorter period of time. So, here's a key
[00:03:24] takeaway to check that you are using the
[00:03:27] effort time exchange the right way and
[00:03:29] that you're activating the generation
[00:03:30] effect to become a faster learner. I
[00:03:33] call this the level of struggle. And
[00:03:37] this is basically a check that we do for
[00:03:38] ourselves while we're studying. You ask
[00:03:41] yourself, am I reaching the right level
[00:03:44] of struggle? For example, let's say I'm
[00:03:47] reading a textbook and I'm not really
[00:03:49] thinking about it very actively. I'm
[00:03:50] just scanning my eyes over the page. I'm
[00:03:52] just kind of taking in the words and at
[00:03:54] the end of it, I haven't really learned
[00:03:56] very much. My mind is passive during
[00:03:59] this process. There isn't any struggle
[00:04:02] going on here. So if I ask myself, am I
[00:04:04] reaching the level of struggle for
[00:04:07] reading? In other words, am I activating
[00:04:10] the generation effect? The answer to
[00:04:12] that is going to be no. And so instead,
[00:04:14] we can think about a little bit more
[00:04:16] actively as we're reading. Try to
[00:04:18] deliberately pick out which ideas seem
[00:04:21] to be more important than the other
[00:04:22] ideas. How do those ideas fit together
[00:04:25] into a bigger picture? When you start
[00:04:26] thinking about that consciously, then
[00:04:30] your struggle increases. Your brain goes
[00:04:33] into a higher gear. It's activated more.
[00:04:35] The generation effect is activated more.
[00:04:38] And now we're using the effort time
[00:04:40] exchange by spending more effort to save
[00:04:43] us time later. Same thing with writing
[00:04:45] notes. If I'm just writing notes
[00:04:47] mindlessly, as many notes as I can,
[00:04:49] essentially a human photocopier, that's
[00:04:51] not reaching the level of struggle.
[00:04:53] Whereas if I'm thinking about what to
[00:04:56] write, how to write it, how to express
[00:04:58] it, which things are more important,
[00:04:59] these things all increase the effort,
[00:05:02] increase the effectiveness of the
[00:05:03] learning, drive up that memory and that
[00:05:06] depth of understanding, and again,
[00:05:08] therefore save you time, making you a
[00:05:09] faster learner. And one of the most
[00:05:11] common ways that I see people not
[00:05:12] reaching the right level of struggle is
[00:05:15] when they're testing themselves. It
[00:05:17] could be with a practice question, or it
[00:05:18] could be using flashcards. Something as
[00:05:19] simple as just trying your best to try
[00:05:23] to recall something before checking the
[00:05:25] answer makes a difference to how that
[00:05:27] knowledge is going to stick into your
[00:05:29] memory. So once you flip that switch
[00:05:31] from not trying to make learning easier
[00:05:34] but actually deliberately trying to
[00:05:35] reach the right level of struggle to
[00:05:38] activate the generation effect and use
[00:05:40] this effort time exchange. That's really
[00:05:43] the secret that unlocks becoming a
[00:05:44] faster learner. Now, one of the biggest
[00:05:46] struggles that people have, which isn't
[00:05:49] helpful, is when they're learning
[00:05:52] through a learning style that they're
[00:05:54] not used to. And this brings me to the
[00:05:56] second principle, which is the omniarner
[00:05:59] principle. You've probably heard that
[00:06:02] everyone has a certain learning style
[00:06:05] that they're better at and they're more
[00:06:06] suited to. And you should find that
[00:06:08] style and do more of that because that's
[00:06:10] where you're going to thrive. And if
[00:06:12] you've heard that before, I wouldn't
[00:06:14] blame you because it's enormously
[00:06:17] prevalent. Unfortunately, it's
[00:06:19] completely a myth. Research over decades
[00:06:23] has clearly shown that there is no such
[00:06:26] thing as a learning style. You do not
[00:06:28] have a unique style of learning that you
[00:06:32] need to find and just become really good
[00:06:34] at. So for example, the common framework
[00:06:37] that people throw around all the time is
[00:06:39] VA. V A R K. This is a learning styles
[00:06:42] acronym which stands for visual auditory
[00:06:45] read and write kinesthetic. So here's
[00:06:48] the truth about learning styles and why
[00:06:50] surprisingly even though learning styles
[00:06:53] don't exist, it's still matters and you
[00:06:56] should know about it. Pretty much every
[00:06:58] single human brain is much better at
[00:07:00] processing visual information than any
[00:07:02] other kind of information unless you
[00:07:04] have a severe neurological condition.
[00:07:05] Studies show that you can process visual
[00:07:07] information tens of thousands of times
[00:07:10] faster than something like written
[00:07:12] information. Obvious thing, look at a
[00:07:15] painting versus read a description of
[00:07:17] that
[00:07:18] painting. Which one can you interpret
[00:07:21] faster? We also know that in modern
[00:07:23] education, a lot of emphasis is placed
[00:07:25] from a very young age on reading and
[00:07:28] writing skills as part of studying. Most
[00:07:30] people have very strong habits of
[00:07:33] learning that rely on reading and
[00:07:35] writing. And so visual learning is
[00:07:38] something we are
[00:07:39] biologically very good at. And reading
[00:07:42] and writing is something that we have
[00:07:44] trained habits of. Some of us may also
[00:07:47] have figured out some habits on learning
[00:07:49] from listening because again that's a
[00:07:52] big part of modern education. But here's
[00:07:54] the thing. Let's say you feel like you
[00:07:58] are a strongly read and write style
[00:08:01] learner. That's the way that you can
[00:08:03] learn every other style. It's harder for
[00:08:05] you to learn through. Like this is your
[00:08:07] bread and butter. If that's the case,
[00:08:09] you are going to be substantially
[00:08:12] limited in life. You are making the
[00:08:15] decision to handicap your learning
[00:08:17] efficiency. And this is really obvious
[00:08:19] if we think through a common scenario,
[00:08:21] for example, going through something
[00:08:23] like university. So let's say there are
[00:08:24] some pre-ereading that we need to do
[00:08:27] before a lecture followed by a lecture
[00:08:30] of two hours and then we do some kind of
[00:08:33] practical lab assessment to help us
[00:08:35] learn it and then we do some self-study
[00:08:38] using textbooks uh and then we do that
[00:08:40] over and over and over again. If the
[00:08:42] only way that you can learn is through
[00:08:44] reading and writing, then it means that
[00:08:47] part of this and this is effective for
[00:08:50] you and then all of this time in the
[00:08:52] middle is basically a waste of time. You
[00:08:54] don't know how to be effective in that
[00:08:56] time. And this gets worse as you get
[00:08:58] older. In the professional world, you
[00:09:01] cannot control how you need to learn
[00:09:04] things. Information will just come at
[00:09:06] you from all different angles of every
[00:09:08] different style. The difference is can
[00:09:11] you manage that or not? And so there is
[00:09:14] an advantage undeniably at being good at
[00:09:19] learning through every single style even
[00:09:22] if you don't prefer that style, even if
[00:09:25] you currently feel that it's more
[00:09:27] difficult learning through that style.
[00:09:29] This is what it means to be an omnier.
[00:09:31] And the reason this saves you time is
[00:09:33] because it means 100% of the time that
[00:09:37] you are engaged in a learning
[00:09:39] experience. You know how to extract
[00:09:41] meaningful learning from that instead of
[00:09:44] saying I don't know how to deal with
[00:09:46] this information. I'm getting
[00:09:48] overwhelmed. I need the future version
[00:09:50] of me to deal with this. And guess what?
[00:09:54] That takes more time. So the key
[00:09:55] takeaway to becoming an omnilearner is
[00:09:58] to ask yourself the question, how can I
[00:10:02] organize this? This is a magical
[00:10:06] question which is going to transform
[00:10:08] your learning efficiency. And you ask
[00:10:10] this to yourself every time you're
[00:10:12] learning something, whether you're
[00:10:14] reading something or listening to
[00:10:15] something. And this is not the same
[00:10:17] question as do I understand this. It's
[00:10:20] not the same as do I remember this?
[00:10:24] Because organizing is a very specific
[00:10:27] cognitive process. To organize
[00:10:29] something, you actively have to
[00:10:31] understand each component, see how it
[00:10:34] fits together, make sense of it, and
[00:10:37] understand how you could rearrange it in
[00:10:39] a way that would still make sense. You
[00:10:42] can understand something while not being
[00:10:45] able to organize it. And that is an
[00:10:47] example of having very superficial
[00:10:49] knowledge. You'll probably also have a
[00:10:51] pretty weak memory. If that's all you're
[00:10:53] able to achieve when you're learning,
[00:10:55] you will struggle with learning more
[00:10:56] efficiently. And this also can be a huge
[00:10:59] trap because when you understand
[00:11:01] something, it feels like you've learned
[00:11:04] it. It feels like you will remember this
[00:11:07] and then you will hold on to it. Let me
[00:11:09] tell you, the research says and your own
[00:11:11] personal experience probably also tells
[00:11:13] you that's not true. You can understand
[00:11:16] something perfectly fine and still
[00:11:17] forget it a week later and still not be
[00:11:19] able to solve problems using it. An easy
[00:11:21] way to think about this is like a messy
[00:11:23] room. You can understand a messy room.
[00:11:27] You can look at it and see all the stuff
[00:11:29] scattered on the floor and you can
[00:11:30] understand. You might even be able to
[00:11:32] remember what you're seeing, but it
[00:11:35] doesn't mean that it has now become
[00:11:37] organized. And so when you go into that
[00:11:39] room to use things and actually put
[00:11:41] things together and quickly call things
[00:11:43] out, it's going to be difficult because
[00:11:45] it's not organized. And as more things
[00:11:48] come into that room, it's going to get
[00:11:50] more and more disorganized. It's going
[00:11:52] to get messier and messier. And that for
[00:11:55] learning is when you start feeling
[00:11:58] overwhelmed. That's when you can feel
[00:12:00] it's slipping out of your brain as it's
[00:12:02] coming in. How long it takes you to
[00:12:05] organize it is how long it takes you to
[00:12:08] learn it. Here's a few easy examples.
[00:12:10] You're reading something. I ask myself,
[00:12:13] how can I organize what I'm reading?
[00:12:16] This is easy. Instead of just reading
[00:12:18] mindlessly, look at it more actively.
[00:12:21] Reorganize the things that you're
[00:12:23] reading. Don't just read it from the
[00:12:24] beginning to the end. Pick what you
[00:12:26] think is more important. Take that
[00:12:28] knowledge and make a decision where you
[00:12:30] want to place that. what more
[00:12:32] information you want to then read. Maybe
[00:12:35] you read the next paragraph and it's not
[00:12:36] giving you the answer that you need that
[00:12:38] you're really now curious about. Don't
[00:12:41] read that paragraph. You can come back
[00:12:42] to that later. Search. Use the textbook
[00:12:47] as just a raw source of information and
[00:12:50] interrogate it and extract the
[00:12:53] information that you want to help you
[00:12:55] organize. That is what active reading
[00:12:58] really is. Same thing with something
[00:12:59] visual. could be a diagram or a
[00:13:01] flowchart. Don't just take it for what
[00:13:03] it is. Construct it in your mind.
[00:13:06] Rearrange things. Simplify it more.
[00:13:09] Group things more. Do not be content
[00:13:12] with just accepting that this is how it
[00:13:15] must be. Challenge it. Critique it.
[00:13:18] Judge it. Ask questions about it. It
[00:13:20] doesn't matter that someone else has
[00:13:21] organized it for you. The learning
[00:13:22] hasn't happened until you organize it
[00:13:25] yourself. And people that can do that
[00:13:26] and flip that switch quickly can learn
[00:13:30] quickly. But what about when you're
[00:13:32] listening? You don't have anything to
[00:13:34] read. People the information just coming
[00:13:37] at you at a pace that you cannot
[00:13:39] control. This is more difficult. This is
[00:13:41] where you need to use things like
[00:13:43] notetaking to just offload pieces of
[00:13:46] information to help you keep track and
[00:13:48] then you organize it. Being able to do
[00:13:50] this kind of thinking when someone is
[00:13:52] speaking to you is a higher level of
[00:13:54] skill than being able to do this when
[00:13:56] you're reading or or looking at an
[00:13:58] image. This is also the reason why I
[00:13:59] recommend to tell my students to learn
[00:14:01] to do this with reading first and then
[00:14:05] you can naturally start to apply it even
[00:14:07] when you're listening. And so ultimately
[00:14:09] when you become this omniarner, you're
[00:14:12] actually gaining the skills to reach the
[00:14:16] right level of struggle in any learning
[00:14:19] style that's presented to you. Now, if
[00:14:21] you've been watching my videos for a
[00:14:22] while, you might know that sometimes I
[00:14:24] also talk about something called learner
[00:14:26] types. Not learning style, but learner
[00:14:29] type. A learner type is your existing
[00:14:33] habits and strengths and weaknesses and
[00:14:35] processes. It's a snapshot of how you
[00:14:38] currently learn. And for most people,
[00:14:40] that's a combination of things that are
[00:14:41] working well for them and then things
[00:14:43] that are holding them back and making
[00:14:44] them waste time. And so, one of the
[00:14:46] fastest ways to become a learner who is
[00:14:50] faster than everyone else is to figure
[00:14:53] out what those time waster techniques
[00:14:57] are versus the ones that are truly
[00:14:59] working for you. and to make that very
[00:15:01] explicit so you can see okay I've been
[00:15:03] using this technique for years but
[00:15:05] actually only half of it was producing
[00:15:08] the benefit and this other half is
[00:15:10] unnecessary and then that's how we can
[00:15:12] start replacing and upgrading our
[00:15:14] learning system this is a process that I
[00:15:15] went through thousands of times for
[00:15:17] years to refine my own learning system
[00:15:19] now you might be thinking Justin that
[00:15:21] seems like a lot of work to do trial and
[00:15:24] error thousands of times for years to
[00:15:28] figure this out is Is there really no
[00:15:30] better way? Well, what a great question
[00:15:32] you've asked because the answer is that
[00:15:34] there is. And in fact, I took those
[00:15:37] years of my trial and error and the
[00:15:39] research that I read and I put it into a
[00:15:42] free quiz that you can do to figure out
[00:15:45] your learner type. And so instead of
[00:15:48] spending years to figure out your
[00:15:50] strengths and your habits and your
[00:15:51] processes, you can do this quiz which
[00:15:53] takes a few minutes and you can get a
[00:15:55] report at the end that says these are
[00:15:57] probably the things that are holding you
[00:15:59] back and wasting your time. So if you're
[00:16:01] interested in that, again, it's
[00:16:02] completely free. I'll leave a link for
[00:16:03] you in the description. Now, speaking of
[00:16:06] spending years to figure something out,
[00:16:08] this next and final principle is one
[00:16:10] that definitely will not take you that
[00:16:12] long. This is the easiest principle to
[00:16:16] utilize of the ones that we've covered
[00:16:18] so far, and it is just as powerful. This
[00:16:21] is to maximize the iteration effect. So,
[00:16:24] here is an incredibly accurate depiction
[00:16:27] of how most people go about their
[00:16:28] learning. Learn stuff, study, keep doing
[00:16:32] that for a long time. Oh no, the test or
[00:16:35] exam is coming up. I better test myself.
[00:16:38] do practice questions as much as I can
[00:16:40] until I run out of time. Uh, and
[00:16:43] hopefully I will be okay for the exam. I
[00:16:48] think this probably describes 99% of my
[00:16:50] entire study strategy for all of high
[00:16:52] school. And this is also an example of
[00:16:54] almost no iteration effect. But here's
[00:16:57] why studying in this way is a massive
[00:16:59] waste of time. Effective learning is a
[00:17:01] constant process of thinking of a
[00:17:05] hypothesis and then seeing if that
[00:17:07] hypothesis is right or wrong. What you
[00:17:09] should be doing is that you get a new
[00:17:12] piece of information. You get another
[00:17:14] piece of information and you have a
[00:17:15] hypothesis about how these two pieces of
[00:17:18] information relate to each other and fit
[00:17:21] into the big picture of the topic that
[00:17:22] you're trying to learn. This is what
[00:17:24] gives information meaning and context
[00:17:26] and this is what helps your brain
[00:17:28] actually use that information correctly.
[00:17:30] When more information comes in, you
[00:17:32] again make that same comparison. How
[00:17:34] does it connect to and how does it fit
[00:17:36] in with the other things that you've
[00:17:38] learned? And so as more and more
[00:17:40] information comes in, we develop more
[00:17:42] and more hypotheses around how we think
[00:17:45] it's all connected together. But when
[00:17:48] we're first learning a topic, we don't
[00:17:49] know for sure. Like I said, it's a
[00:17:51] hypothesis. So, we might think that
[00:17:53] these two pieces of information are
[00:17:55] connected like this, but this could be
[00:17:58] wrong. And if it is wrong, we want to
[00:18:01] know that it's wrong early on because
[00:18:04] otherwise this misunderstanding is going
[00:18:06] to carry through for the way that we
[00:18:09] form every hypothesis after it. And so
[00:18:12] when you get that light bulb moment,
[00:18:14] when everything suddenly clicks and you
[00:18:16] just get it and it just makes sense,
[00:18:19] what that means is that you had a
[00:18:22] hypothesis and it was confirmed. It was
[00:18:25] locked in. The uncertainty has gone
[00:18:28] down. It suddenly made sense because you
[00:18:31] see this is how it connects. This is the
[00:18:34] big picture. You've seen the picture for
[00:18:35] the first time. That's the light bulb
[00:18:38] moment. And in order to get to that
[00:18:40] light bulb moment quickly without
[00:18:43] spending weeks of studying, we have to
[00:18:45] generate these hypotheses, we then have
[00:18:48] to get feedback on whether that
[00:18:51] hypothesis is correct or not. And then
[00:18:54] we use that information to refine our
[00:18:57] hypothesis. And so this cycle is an
[00:19:00] iteration. And so when you repeat these
[00:19:03] iterations over and over again, your
[00:19:06] learning gets stronger and deeper, your
[00:19:08] memory gets stronger, and your
[00:19:10] understanding becomes more complete and
[00:19:12] accurate. That's what it means to
[00:19:14] maximize the iteration effect. It means
[00:19:17] generate lots of hypotheses very
[00:19:19] quickly, very early on, and then get
[00:19:22] feedback on it by testing yourself very
[00:19:25] early on and very frequently to find
[00:19:28] gaps in knowledge and then fix them. If
[00:19:31] we don't do this and we do what we were
[00:19:32] doing before and we're only testing
[00:19:34] ourselves here near the end, then if we
[00:19:37] find one of these mistakes and the way
[00:19:40] that we've understood how things connect
[00:19:41] together, then we now have to spend the
[00:19:43] work to relearn and re
[00:19:48] bigize everything that that was related
[00:19:51] to. That is a huge unnecessary waste of
[00:19:55] time. So the key takeaway here is to
[00:19:58] test to the max. For example, schedule
[00:20:03] time at the end of every week to test
[00:20:06] yourself on the stuff that you learned
[00:20:08] during that week. And remember, you're
[00:20:10] looking for mistakes and gaps. The
[00:20:12] purpose of testing is not to give
[00:20:13] yourself a pat on the back and feel good
[00:20:15] about it. It is to find the mistakes. So
[00:20:17] test yourself in a way that is
[00:20:19] challenging. A good test is a difficult
[00:20:22] test. Don't test yourself on the things
[00:20:24] that you know you already know that
[00:20:26] you're not going to forget. Think about
[00:20:27] how you really need to use that
[00:20:29] information at what level of complexity.
[00:20:32] Test yourself in that way. You can even
[00:20:34] use something like micro retrieval which
[00:20:37] is testing yourself immediately after
[00:20:40] you have learned it. Reading something
[00:20:41] and then just as you write your notes on
[00:20:43] it straight away you're not looking back
[00:20:46] at your notes. You're trying to test
[00:20:47] whether you've understood it and
[00:20:48] organized it properly. And if you have
[00:20:51] reached the right level of struggle and
[00:20:54] then you are reading and organizing it
[00:20:56] actively, you should find that when you
[00:20:59] test yourself, you understand it well
[00:21:01] and you can remember it. And if you
[00:21:03] can't, that probably indicates that
[00:21:06] there was some issue with the way that
[00:21:07] you were organizing it or that you
[00:21:09] didn't reach the level of struggle.
[00:21:11] That's immediate feedback. You can also
[00:21:13] use micro retrieval in applying your
[00:21:15] knowledge straight away. So straight
[00:21:17] after learning something if there's some
[00:21:19] procedural aspect of it use that
[00:21:20] knowledge to solve a problem to build
[00:21:24] something to develop a software this is
[00:21:26] one reason why a lot of professionals
[00:21:28] find that suddenly learning is more
[00:21:30] efficient for them when they're learning
[00:21:31] on the job because immediately after
[00:21:34] learning something they are applying it
[00:21:36] and they're getting feedback and data on
[00:21:38] whether they have understood it
[00:21:39] correctly or not. But you don't need to
[00:21:41] get a job to do that. You you can just
[00:21:44] do that. You can just choose to do that
[00:21:46] and then your learning will be faster.
[00:21:47] When you apply these three learning
[00:21:48] principles, you will be able to learn
[00:21:50] faster than most people you encounter.
[00:21:52] And if you want to figure out what else
[00:21:53] might be holding you back, remember to
[00:21:55] take that learner type quiz. The links
[00:21:56] in the description to that. Thank you so
[00:21:58] much for watching and I'll see you next
[00:21:59] time.


=== You Can Become A Genius In 12 Months. Here's How... ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSOsx79hVIw

[00:00:00] I've been a learning coach for over a
[00:00:01] decade and in this video I'm going to
[00:00:02] give you a 12month blueprint to become a
[00:00:06] genius so let's start with month number
[00:00:08] one the first month is called Discovery
[00:00:10] so we can divide the first month into
[00:00:12] two phases the first phase which can
[00:00:15] take one to two weeks this is about
[00:00:18] understanding where our goalpost even is
[00:00:20] you can't become a genius if you don't
[00:00:22] even know what a genius means and the
[00:00:23] difference between just a hard worker
[00:00:26] and a genius is that a hard worker is
[00:00:28] able to work hard they can study more
[00:00:31] they're able to do long hours the genius
[00:00:34] doesn't need to do that they don't need
[00:00:36] to study more because they're fine with
[00:00:39] the workload their method for tackling
[00:00:41] this workload is effective and efficient
[00:00:44] enough that they don't need to
[00:00:45] compensate with more time they're not
[00:00:47] struggling with their focus and their
[00:00:48] concentration so they don't need to
[00:00:49] study for longer hours the reason that a
[00:00:51] Genius Feels Like hard to relate to is
[00:00:55] because a genius is thinking and
[00:00:57] studying and doing things in a very
[00:00:59] different different way for the same
[00:01:01] amount of time and effort that an
[00:01:03] average person puts in they seem to be
[00:01:05] able to transform that into a result
[00:01:07] that is Untouchable by an average person
[00:01:10] and so the way that we become a genius
[00:01:12] ourselves is not to just put in more
[00:01:14] time and effort it is to think about
[00:01:17] what can we do that converts that time
[00:01:19] and effort and amplifies it much more
[00:01:22] than what we're doing now so in this
[00:01:24] first phase of the first month we need
[00:01:26] to spend a bit of time to learn about
[00:01:28] what the processes are that a genius
[00:01:30] uses these become our goals and to help
[00:01:33] you with this I'll tell you there are
[00:01:35] three things that a genius is able to do
[00:01:37] that average people really struggle with
[00:01:39] the first one is having a high retention
[00:01:42] of new information that they learn the
[00:01:44] second thing is having a high Mastery of
[00:01:48] what they learn so for example you can
[00:01:49] have a really high retention great
[00:01:52] memory on something but if you can only
[00:01:53] regurgitate facts it's a very low level
[00:01:55] of Mastery compared to being able to
[00:01:56] solve really complex problems a genius
[00:01:58] can do both p retention and high Mastery
[00:02:01] and the third thing is they can do that
[00:02:03] with time efficiency and so now that
[00:02:05] we've got our goal in this first phase
[00:02:07] it completely reshapes the way that we
[00:02:09] think about improving it's no longer
[00:02:11] about how can I study more how can I
[00:02:12] study longer we're saying we're already
[00:02:15] studying enough the question is how do
[00:02:17] we keep the time and if at the same but
[00:02:19] increase our retention our Mony and our
[00:02:22] time efficiency and then once you have
[00:02:23] that we can move into the second phase
[00:02:25] of the first month which takes another 2
[00:02:28] weeks and here we want to figure out our
[00:02:30] current status the purpose of this stage
[00:02:33] is to figure out our current position
[00:02:35] relative to the goal so how good are we
[00:02:38] in terms of our retention how good is
[00:02:40] our current level of Mastery how good is
[00:02:43] our current level of time efficiency we
[00:02:45] know the goal we need to see how far
[00:02:47] away we are from hitting that goal so
[00:02:49] let's say we think our retention and our
[00:02:50] Mastery and a Time efficiency are
[00:02:51] terrible Justin why does it take 2 weeks
[00:02:54] to do this instead of like 2 seconds
[00:02:56] it's because if you're bad at it just
[00:02:58] knowing that you're bad is not enough
[00:03:01] you have to also know why you are bad at
[00:03:03] it one of my favorite questions to ask
[00:03:05] when I do workshops is I tell everyone
[00:03:08] to draw their current learning flow the
[00:03:11] way you do this is you just trace the
[00:03:13] path of a single piece of information so
[00:03:15] let's say you learned something new on a
[00:03:16] Monday what are you doing like did you
[00:03:19] do anything before what are you thinking
[00:03:21] about how are you writing your notes as
[00:03:23] you learn that what are you doing
[00:03:24] immediately after what are you doing the
[00:03:26] day after what are you doing the week
[00:03:27] after and why why why for every single
[00:03:29] step when I asked this question the
[00:03:31] reason I like it is that most people
[00:03:33] have never consciously thought about
[00:03:35] what they do with new information their
[00:03:38] learning flow is just like information
[00:03:40] comes in I just like think about it and
[00:03:43] then I just study and that's it and so
[00:03:45] the reason it takes two weeks is that it
[00:03:49] takes time to start building awareness
[00:03:52] about what your own processes and your
[00:03:54] own thinking habits are what I
[00:03:56] consistently see with the students I
[00:03:58] coach is that the hardest part by far of
[00:04:01] improving your learning ability and
[00:04:03] becoming this genius is not learning new
[00:04:05] techniques it is becoming aware of and
[00:04:09] then unlearning old habits in learning
[00:04:12] science this whole concept I'm talking
[00:04:14] about now of becoming aware of your own
[00:04:17] process and why you do things and how
[00:04:19] effective they are this is called
[00:04:22] metacognition and the research strongly
[00:04:24] shows it is one of the most crucial
[00:04:27] ingredients to improve your learning so
[00:04:29] how do you actually develop
[00:04:30] metacognition and develop this awareness
[00:04:33] so that you can start upgrading well
[00:04:34] there's two ways you can do this there's
[00:04:36] a fast way and a long way and you should
[00:04:38] actually do both the long way is to
[00:04:42] reflect and reflect often if you want to
[00:04:45] become a better learner you have to get
[00:04:49] comfortable with reflecting trying to
[00:04:52] improve without reflecting is like
[00:04:55] trying to look better without a mirror
[00:04:58] it's why a reflection technique is I one
[00:04:59] of the first techniques I teach in my
[00:05:01] program and I'm going to give you a
[00:05:03] simplified version of that technique
[00:05:05] that you can use straight away I call it
[00:05:08] the what how why now what the first what
[00:05:11] is you write down what you actually did
[00:05:14] so let's say that you're reflecting on a
[00:05:16] study session where you wrote a bunch of
[00:05:17] notes so the what you did is writing
[00:05:20] notes on a certain subject the two is
[00:05:23] how how did you write these notes be
[00:05:25] very very specific with the technique
[00:05:27] that you use almost think about creating
[00:05:29] like an instruction manual so that
[00:05:31] someone could just follow it exactly and
[00:05:33] do exactly the same thing you did the
[00:05:35] third is why this is the meaty part
[00:05:38] here's where the value starts coming in
[00:05:40] think about why you did the technique in
[00:05:44] the way that you did it what was your
[00:05:45] rationale and when you do this often you
[00:05:48] realize you didn't even have a rationale
[00:05:50] you just did it because it's what you're
[00:05:51] used to sometimes the reason you do
[00:05:53] things is in response to a difficulty or
[00:05:56] a challenge you face while studying so
[00:05:59] note that down down how do you tend to
[00:06:01] respond to certain types of difficulties
[00:06:03] and challenges this is how you discover
[00:06:06] your current habits and the fourth thing
[00:06:08] is now what we look at the what and the
[00:06:12] how we did we evaluate the why we did it
[00:06:16] and ask ourselves is there a way that I
[00:06:18] could potentially make this better for
[00:06:20] next time you come up with just one or
[00:06:22] two changes that you could make and then
[00:06:24] you run that as an experiment after you
[00:06:26] run that experiment you go back from the
[00:06:28] beginning and reflect on it what did you
[00:06:30] do how did you do it why did you do it
[00:06:33] and then you create the next experiment
[00:06:34] it's an infinite cycle of improvement I
[00:06:36] kid you not between the ages of 18 to 22
[00:06:41] I did this process for my own
[00:06:44] learning thousands of times it is
[00:06:47] without a doubt one of the biggest
[00:06:49] reasons I was able to improve my
[00:06:51] learning efficiency as much as I did and
[00:06:53] go from studying 20 hours a day to less
[00:06:56] than 20 hours a week in fact you guys
[00:06:58] have a really easy because this first
[00:07:01] month of Discovery this took me like 3
[00:07:04] years to do but it's about to get even
[00:07:05] easier because this is the long way and
[00:07:08] then the fast way which you should start
[00:07:11] with is taking my free quiz so I've
[00:07:15] created a quiz that assesses you on your
[00:07:17] current Learning System and points out
[00:07:19] certain things that may be critical
[00:07:22] habits the quiz is free to do and then
[00:07:24] at the end you get a personalized report
[00:07:25] on the things that it notices based on
[00:07:27] the questions that asks you so if you
[00:07:29] start start off by doing this quiz then
[00:07:31] not only do you get a great list of
[00:07:33] things to start working on but also
[00:07:35] teaches you how to think about your
[00:07:37] learning which means when you do your
[00:07:38] reflection you can be a lot more
[00:07:40] targeted have better ideas and you know
[00:07:42] what to pay attention to the quiz is
[00:07:44] free to do it's called a learning system
[00:07:47] Diagnostic and you can check out the
[00:07:49] description for a link and I want to say
[00:07:52] that by the end of your first month you
[00:07:55] will probably already feel so much more
[00:07:58] confident and control of your learning
[00:08:00] I've had people do this for even just
[00:08:02] one week and then DM me saying that they
[00:08:06] have a huge list of things that they
[00:08:08] have realized that they need to improve
[00:08:09] on because they've just learned so much
[00:08:11] about how they learn and once you get to
[00:08:13] that point at the end of your first
[00:08:15] month where you know what you need to
[00:08:17] work on and you know what you're
[00:08:18] currently doing you're ready for month
[00:08:20] number two month number two is all about
[00:08:22] making high yield changes one thing you
[00:08:25] realize after doing the first month is
[00:08:27] that there are so so many things that
[00:08:30] you could do better there are so many
[00:08:31] things that you can optimize where do
[00:08:33] you even start and once you feel that I
[00:08:35] want you to remember this the fastest
[00:08:37] path to Improvement is by picking the
[00:08:40] fastest path and this is important
[00:08:42] because when it comes to learning to
[00:08:44] learn the thing you should start working
[00:08:46] on first is usually not the thing that's
[00:08:50] going to make the biggest overall
[00:08:53] difference one of my students recently
[00:08:54] made this mistake so I want to explain
[00:08:56] this properly as you go through your
[00:08:57] first month of Discovery and you're
[00:08:59] learning about the processes that create
[00:09:02] good retention and deeper Mastery and
[00:09:04] more time efficiency one of the things
[00:09:06] you'll realize and I talk about this a
[00:09:07] lot the way that you process and think
[00:09:10] about information the first time you
[00:09:12] learn it has a strong influence on how
[00:09:16] sticky that memory becomes and How
[00:09:18] Deeply you understand it when you think
[00:09:21] about it deeply and you process it
[00:09:22] deeply that memory becomes stickier this
[00:09:25] is the process called encoding it's the
[00:09:28] act of taking you information and
[00:09:30] putting it into our long-term memory
[00:09:31] that's called encoding if you can do
[00:09:33] encoding really really well your
[00:09:35] retention is better your Mastery is
[00:09:37] deeper and because you're not wasting
[00:09:39] time on relearning things your time
[00:09:40] efficiency goes up by a lot so if we
[00:09:43] could point to just one thing to be
[00:09:46] amazingly good at it would be encoding
[00:09:49] that is the thing that is going to make
[00:09:51] the biggest difference to your overall
[00:09:53] learning ability and in fact when we
[00:09:55] look at a genius that is the thing that
[00:09:57] they have that we know
[00:09:59] they can just learn something the first
[00:10:02] time hold on to it understand it really
[00:10:04] really deeply and they do it in little
[00:10:06] to no time and
[00:10:08] encoding is not the first thing that you
[00:10:10] should work on improving because it is
[00:10:13] not the fastest path to
[00:10:15] Improvement the reason is because to
[00:10:18] become a really good encoder and to
[00:10:21] train your processing ability to get all
[00:10:25] those benefits it takes time these are
[00:10:28] habits that we have to unlearn and then
[00:10:30] relearn and so in my experience coaching
[00:10:32] I've realized that there are four things
[00:10:34] that make something a good high yield
[00:10:37] change to work on in month number two
[00:10:41] the first thing is rate limiters a rate
[00:10:44] limiter is basically the thing that
[00:10:46] holds you back the most so if you
[00:10:48] imagine like a wooden barrel made of
[00:10:50] wooden planks and one of these planks is
[00:10:52] broken in half you try to fill this
[00:10:53] Barrel up with water all the water is
[00:10:55] just going to leak out through that
[00:10:57] broken plank it doesn't matter how nice
[00:10:59] or the other planks around this Barrel
[00:11:01] La if that one is broken water is going
[00:11:03] to come out there that's the rate
[00:11:05] limiter and anything you identify during
[00:11:07] your first month of discovery that you
[00:11:11] see as a rate limiter is going to be a
[00:11:13] highe change because it means as soon as
[00:11:16] you improve it everything else that it
[00:11:19] has been holding back gets better as
[00:11:21] well for most students that I work with
[00:11:23] this rate limiter is procrastination it
[00:11:26] does not matter how well you can study
[00:11:29] and how good you can encode information
[00:11:31] or whatever you're doing if you
[00:11:33] procrastinate so much that you can never
[00:11:34] really sit down to follow a schedule and
[00:11:37] get stuff done in the first place
[00:11:39] doesn't matter for some people it's
[00:11:41] stress or mental health I've had a lot
[00:11:43] of students who are really really
[00:11:45] focused on improving their learning
[00:11:46] skills but they're so nervous and
[00:11:48] anxious about it and the act of studying
[00:11:51] creates so much mental distress that
[00:11:53] they can never really concentrate in
[00:11:55] this case the mental health becomes the
[00:11:57] rate limiter working on the the rate
[00:11:59] limiter is the tide that lifts all boats
[00:12:02] and it's not actually worth working on
[00:12:05] other things until that rate limiter is
[00:12:08] solved the second criteria for something
[00:12:10] that makes a great high yield change is
[00:12:12] things that have a low lead time lead
[00:12:17] time is basically a term for how long it
[00:12:20] takes for something to manifest so in
[00:12:23] something like medicine cancer often has
[00:12:26] a long lead time because you can have
[00:12:29] cancer for a very very long time before
[00:12:31] you even start to notice any signs or
[00:12:33] symptoms by the time it's diagnosed may
[00:12:36] have already been months as opposed to
[00:12:38] for example getting hit in the face with
[00:12:40] a baseball bat where the lead time is
[00:12:42] like zero as soon as it makes contact
[00:12:43] with your face you know something is
[00:12:45] wrong for learning to learn there are
[00:12:47] certain techniques and strategies that
[00:12:50] have a very low lead time in terms of
[00:12:52] providing you benefit so encoding has a
[00:12:56] very long lead time you have to spend
[00:12:58] weeks maybe months unlearning habits and
[00:13:01] learning new habits for your encoding
[00:13:04] skills to be high enough for it to
[00:13:05] really solve your problems on the other
[00:13:07] hand retrieval strategies things that
[00:13:10] use active recall using flash cards if
[00:13:13] you're not using flash cards doing
[00:13:15] interleaving if you're not doing
[00:13:17] interleaving doing something like
[00:13:19] pre-study these things produce an
[00:13:21] immediate benefit because the skill
[00:13:24] requirement is not very high you could
[00:13:26] start using it tomorrow and gain a
[00:13:28] benefit from from it tomorrow you want
[00:13:30] to work on these quick wins first so
[00:13:33] that you have a little bit more time and
[00:13:35] space to work on the really high impact
[00:13:39] things like encoding that take time the
[00:13:42] third type of highe change is an
[00:13:44] incremental change an incremental change
[00:13:47] is taking something that might normally
[00:13:49] have a long lead time I.E it takes a
[00:13:52] long time for you to get benefit from it
[00:13:54] and you break that up into smaller
[00:13:56] components so you can start getting
[00:13:58] value from it earlier on one example is
[00:14:01] with note taking if you want to get to
[00:14:03] Great encoding you need to know how to
[00:14:06] think relationally create schemas group
[00:14:09] evaluate categorize create flows and you
[00:14:13] have to be able to do this quickly
[00:14:14] that's very difficult to do off the bat
[00:14:17] so in a lot of my videos I teach people
[00:14:19] to go from just linear note taking like
[00:14:22] they normally do and just start making
[00:14:26] tiny little mind maps within their notes
[00:14:29] it's not giving you the full benefit of
[00:14:31] the perfect version of the technique but
[00:14:34] allows you to familiarize yourself with
[00:14:37] the technique and break up this huge
[00:14:40] process into smaller chunks in my
[00:14:42] program one of the early major
[00:14:44] techniques that I teach is interleaved
[00:14:47] retrieval the reason is that when you
[00:14:50] teach someone to test themselves at a
[00:14:53] high level which is what you should do
[00:14:55] in inter Le retrieval then you actually
[00:14:57] familiarize that person with the type of
[00:15:01] thinking pattern that they one day need
[00:15:03] to generate themselves it is easier to
[00:15:06] test someone at a higher level and force
[00:15:09] their brain to think at a higher level
[00:15:11] than it is to tell someone to just think
[00:15:14] at that level to begin with so if
[00:15:15] someone's used to testing themselves at
[00:15:18] this high level and therefore they're
[00:15:20] used to thinking at this high level then
[00:15:22] one day when they try to encode at that
[00:15:25] level it's much easier and the fourth
[00:15:27] and final High type of change is a
[00:15:31] priority change one of the most common
[00:15:33] reasons people will never make it past
[00:15:36] month one or month two is because they
[00:15:39] don't have enough time to commit to
[00:15:41] Improvement and sometimes we're just so
[00:15:43] busy trying to stay on top of the
[00:15:45] problems we have that we don't have
[00:15:48] enough time to actually fix the problems
[00:15:50] in the first place but if we don't fix
[00:15:53] the problem we are dooming ourselves to
[00:15:55] repeat that problem and that situation
[00:15:57] usually means we have to re-evaluate our
[00:16:00] priorities now if you've been following
[00:16:01] along you probably realize that there's
[00:16:04] a lot of stuff to do in month number two
[00:16:08] and you're right which is why this is
[00:16:09] not just month number two this is month
[00:16:11] two and three at the beginning of month
[00:16:15] two you will have an awareness of what
[00:16:18] you are doing and what you could improve
[00:16:20] on and then towards the end of month
[00:16:23] number three you have a
[00:16:27] foundation of high changes your rate
[00:16:30] limits have been addressed you not only
[00:16:32] have an awareness of what you're doing
[00:16:34] and what can be fixed you also have
[00:16:36] experience actively trying to fix them
[00:16:39] and frankly for most people even just at
[00:16:42] this point it's enough for them to reach
[00:16:45] their current learning goal the problems
[00:16:48] that they've been struggling with maybe
[00:16:49] for years can be fixed by this point but
[00:16:52] if it's not enough or if our goal
[00:16:55] requires even more than that then we
[00:16:56] move on to the next few months which is
[00:16:59] months four five and six these months
[00:17:04] are called cognitive growth you remember
[00:17:08] how I said that the thing that makes the
[00:17:10] biggest difference isn't the thing that
[00:17:11] you should work on first now it's time
[00:17:13] to work on those things this is the path
[00:17:15] of becoming the genius these are also
[00:17:18] the months where most people are likely
[00:17:21] to give up because cognitive growth is
[00:17:24] not comfortable in fact it's impossible
[00:17:28] for cognitive growth to be comfortable
[00:17:30] because the primary activity that
[00:17:33] creates growth during these months what
[00:17:36] we are focusing on is pushing our
[00:17:40] comfort zone here's what I mean let's
[00:17:41] say we've got our existing current
[00:17:44] habits of learning these are the ways of
[00:17:46] learning that we're used to these are
[00:17:48] the things that feel easy and
[00:17:50] comfortable for us our current habits
[00:17:53] form our current comfort zone now
[00:17:56] obviously if we want to become a genius
[00:17:58] we need a different set of habits we
[00:18:01] need a set of habits that are going to
[00:18:02] help us to lock in a greater retention
[00:18:06] Mastery and time efficiency than we're
[00:18:08] able to achieve right now and so by
[00:18:10] definition these new habits that we need
[00:18:13] to form are going to be new and
[00:18:16] different to what we are used to so we
[00:18:18] can say that the things that exist out
[00:18:20] here outside of our comfort zone this is
[00:18:23] the Learning Zone we're learning
[00:18:26] something new so why does this make
[00:18:28] people give up because as we go into the
[00:18:32] Learning Zone we also pass through
[00:18:34] something in the middle called The Fear
[00:18:38] Zone and the further we get from Comfort
[00:18:41] the greater the fear becomes the reason
[00:18:44] is because there is a higher level of
[00:18:47] uncertainty as Things become less
[00:18:49] familiar the level of uncertainty goes
[00:18:53] up if I set you down and then I just
[00:18:56] laid out like an entire learning system
[00:18:59] of every single technique that you need
[00:19:01] to do in exactly the right way first of
[00:19:04] all would be sitting for very long time
[00:19:07] secondly unless you've had a lot of
[00:19:09] training that's going to be very
[00:19:11] difficult for you to perform cuz it's
[00:19:13] you're just not used to it in other
[00:19:15] words the uncertainty is very high what
[00:19:17] if I do this and it doesn't work what if
[00:19:19] I make this mistake or that mistake and
[00:19:21] so there is an innate risk and
[00:19:23] uncertainty with trying something that
[00:19:26] is new because anything that is new new
[00:19:29] carries with it the risk of failure and
[00:19:31] so the journey through months four five
[00:19:33] and six you may think that this is where
[00:19:36] you're learning like all these new
[00:19:39] different techniques and every single
[00:19:41] week you're trying a new technique but
[00:19:43] it's not like that at all what it really
[00:19:46] is is that you can learn all the
[00:19:48] techniques you need to get good at in
[00:19:52] like 45 minutes and for the entire 3
[00:19:55] months all you're doing is just getting
[00:19:58] more and more used to reaching the
[00:20:01] higher levels of that technique I can
[00:20:03] give you an example right now let's say
[00:20:05] that you have a list of 20 words you
[00:20:08] need to learn and understand level one
[00:20:11] technique might be to just try to
[00:20:13] memorize and understand it level two is
[00:20:16] look for similarities between those
[00:20:18] words level three is group the words
[00:20:22] based on those similarities level four
[00:20:25] is rate those words out of 10 based on
[00:20:28] how important you think they are in the
[00:20:31] context of the topic Mel five is try to
[00:20:34] find different types of similarities to
[00:20:37] group them and then rate the types of
[00:20:41] groups based on which grouping method
[00:20:43] you think is the most accurate or most
[00:20:45] important level six is decide on a
[00:20:48] grouping pattern that you feel is the
[00:20:50] most important and then connect the
[00:20:52] groups together level seven is think of
[00:20:55] a different way to group them and
[00:20:57] connect them together and compare how
[00:21:00] accurate and important your first
[00:21:02] grouping pattern is compared to your
[00:21:03] second level eight is to try to simplify
[00:21:07] that group the groups and then connect
[00:21:10] the mega groups to each other so you can
[00:21:12] see that if you're used to thinking at
[00:21:15] level one and everything you learn is
[00:21:17] just try to remember it try to remember
[00:21:18] it try to understand it and you're
[00:21:20] suddenly now starting to go to okay not
[00:21:22] only am I just trying to understand it
[00:21:24] but I'm simultaneously comparing it with
[00:21:26] everything else that I've learned and
[00:21:27] the information that I already have
[00:21:29] creating groupings thinking about
[00:21:30] alternative groupings connecting the
[00:21:32] groupings together creating a flow out
[00:21:34] of those groupings and comparing that
[00:21:35] with a different type of flow and then
[00:21:36] simplifying it that's a lot more
[00:21:39] activity that goes on mentally and that
[00:21:42] could be like eight levels of
[00:21:45] essentially one processing technique and
[00:21:48] so every few days every week during
[00:21:51] these months four five and six you are
[00:21:53] constantly pushing your current habits
[00:21:56] through The Spar Zone into to a more
[00:21:59] uncertain new method of processing
[00:22:02] eventually getting to in that example
[00:22:04] like a level eight and being able to do
[00:22:06] that more comfortably until that becomes
[00:22:09] a habit and forms your new bigger
[00:22:13] comfort zone and so during these months
[00:22:15] there are two indicators that you are
[00:22:18] progressing at the beginning of month 4
[00:22:20] you're just starting to probe the edges
[00:22:23] of the comfort zone you're trying new
[00:22:26] things that are a little uncertain and
[00:22:27] you're trying to to get your brain to
[00:22:29] process information in a way that you're
[00:22:31] not used to and by month six the
[00:22:33] progress you've made is that you're not
[00:22:35] just probing towards the edge of your
[00:22:37] comfort zone you are able to thrive in
[00:22:42] uncertainty you have no problem with
[00:22:44] making mistakes you have no problem with
[00:22:46] trying a new technique you are so used
[00:22:48] to trying new things and expanding your
[00:22:51] comfort zone that the fear Zone has
[00:22:54] evaporated there is only comfort versus
[00:22:57] learning and as result of that learning
[00:23:00] the other progress you make by the end
[00:23:02] of month 6 is that your natural
[00:23:05] processing speed should be noticeably
[00:23:07] higher than it was before and what this
[00:23:09] means is that for the same amount of
[00:23:11] time and effort you able to create a
[00:23:14] much higher level of retention and
[00:23:16] Mastery with information that you're
[00:23:18] learning for the first time you are
[00:23:20] seeing the light of what it means to
[00:23:22] have become the genius and if you've
[00:23:24] made it through to the end of month 6
[00:23:28] then
[00:23:29] the rest of the months become honestly
[00:23:31] much easier months Seven 8 and nine
[00:23:34] become about
[00:23:35] unlocking speed and here's the secret to
[00:23:39] being a really fast learner is that
[00:23:43] learning slow is learning fast there's
[00:23:46] no point being a fast learner if your
[00:23:50] quality is terrible if you're making
[00:23:51] mistakes and errors all over the place
[00:23:53] you can't just be fast you also have to
[00:23:56] be accurate and effective and so so to
[00:23:59] become a meaningfully fast learner you
[00:24:03] first actually need to have accuracy for
[00:24:06] most Learners the high level of Mastery
[00:24:11] or retention is not something they can
[00:24:14] reach even by doubling or tripling the
[00:24:16] amount of time they spend it's like
[00:24:18] expecting a poor quality machine to
[00:24:22] produce a really high quality product
[00:24:26] just by running the machine for longer
[00:24:28] the quality of the output is determined
[00:24:31] by the quality of the process and so for
[00:24:34] most people that are in month number one
[00:24:36] or month zero the quality of the process
[00:24:40] is usually all over the place so even if
[00:24:42] they spend more time studying and
[00:24:45] learning the quality and the Mastery the
[00:24:47] depth of understanding doesn't grow
[00:24:50] significantly this is why you can have
[00:24:52] some people that spend hours and hours
[00:24:54] and hours trying to learn something and
[00:24:56] then someone else can spend tenth of
[00:24:59] that time and gain a deeper
[00:25:01] understanding of the topic by month 6
[00:25:04] the beginning of month 7 what we're
[00:25:05] aiming to do is unlock accuracy we are
[00:25:09] now able to hit that top level the
[00:25:13] genius level that seemed unreachable
[00:25:16] Yeah by this point we can hit that we're
[00:25:19] not fast at it it's not graceful but we
[00:25:23] can get there and once we've unlocked
[00:25:25] accuracy we can then unlock consistency
[00:25:29] so it's not just that we can hit it for
[00:25:32] one topic sometimes it means now we can
[00:25:36] hit it for every topic and every subject
[00:25:39] even when we're busy even when we're
[00:25:40] tired we can still hit that standard and
[00:25:43] what naturally happens once we have
[00:25:46] consistency unlocked is that this
[00:25:49] technique that we have been training so
[00:25:52] hard for so long becomes a new habit and
[00:25:57] when it becomes comes a new habit our
[00:26:00] brain is able to do it much more easily
[00:26:03] and much more quickly the speed comes
[00:26:07] automatically this is why slow learning
[00:26:11] is fast when you focus on doing it
[00:26:13] slowly and properly the speed comes
[00:26:16] without you even trying to be faster and
[00:26:19] I see students make this mistake all the
[00:26:22] time they're so focused on just trying
[00:26:24] to get faster without having the
[00:26:26] accuracy and the consistency but what's
[00:26:28] the point of going faster if you're just
[00:26:31] creating more work for yourself later
[00:26:33] through all the gaps that you're leaving
[00:26:35] behind that's not getting faster that's
[00:26:36] called rushing the only way to learn
[00:26:40] faster is for your brain to find it
[00:26:44] easier to do the learning and that
[00:26:47] happens by creating new habits by the
[00:26:50] end of month number
[00:26:52] nine uh you've uh given birth to a bunch
[00:26:56] of new habits and You' ready for the
[00:26:59] true genius levels of months 10 11 and
[00:27:04] 12 these months are about
[00:27:07] adaptability when I was going through
[00:27:09] medical school I went from studying 20
[00:27:11] hours a day to 10 hours a week and then
[00:27:16] entering into hospitals as a fourth year
[00:27:18] medical student failing my first run
[00:27:21] because I realized the way that I was
[00:27:23] studying was geared too much for exams
[00:27:25] and not real life practice rek working
[00:27:28] my entire Learning System having to then
[00:27:30] go back to studying like 6 seven hours a
[00:27:33] day on top of clinical placements and
[00:27:37] then dropping back down to like 3 4
[00:27:39] hours a week and then working full-time
[00:27:41] while going through medical school so my
[00:27:43] journey of becoming a better learner has
[00:27:45] just been constantly up and down and
[00:27:47] it's only in the last like five years
[00:27:51] that it's been very stable and there are
[00:27:54] not many optimizations I need to make
[00:27:56] anymore so even though at the end of
[00:27:58] month number nine you got these habits
[00:28:00] of being able to hit that high retention
[00:28:04] High Mastery and time efficiency like
[00:28:06] you you achieved it like you became the
[00:28:07] genius what else is left for you what's
[00:28:10] left is that you now need to be able to
[00:28:12] do that and have these habits carry you
[00:28:14] forward even when the challenges get
[00:28:16] harder how you can perform on a good day
[00:28:19] needs to become your Baseline on a bad
[00:28:21] day and so how do you do this you
[00:28:23] actually just go back to month number
[00:28:25] one you've now got a whole new set of
[00:28:28] habits you you're a different person at
[00:28:31] this point so go through figure out
[00:28:33] what's your next set of goals what does
[00:28:35] it mean for you now your new self to be
[00:28:39] even better what is your current status
[00:28:43] and then if you go through this exact
[00:28:44] flow all over again what are the new
[00:28:47] high changes you'll realize there are
[00:28:49] different rate limits there are
[00:28:51] different higho changes you can make
[00:28:53] your foundation can get even stronger
[00:28:55] and a whole new set of habits can be
[00:28:58] built and by continuing this cycle this
[00:29:01] is how you not only just become a genius
[00:29:04] but you stay a genius you create a gap
[00:29:06] between you and who you used to be and
[00:29:09] that Gap continually widens and by
[00:29:12] following this this is what gives you
[00:29:14] the confidence to know that you can go
[00:29:17] into any room and you can learn anything
[00:29:20] and you will be able to perform at the
[00:29:22] level you need to perform no matter what
[00:29:24] the challenges are and if you're looking
[00:29:25] for an easier way to do this my program
[00:29:28] i.com is actually built around this very
[00:29:31] structure it's a blueprint that I've
[00:29:33] used for myself and for thousands of
[00:29:35] students that I've coached and we're
[00:29:36] sharing it with you I hope it can help
[00:29:38] you too thanks for watching and I'll see
[00:29:39] you in the next one


=== 16 Note-Taking Secrets of the Top 1% of Students ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHzmiH7bSNA

[00:00:00] I've been a learning coach for the past
[00:00:01] 13 years I've coached over 25,000
[00:00:04] Learners worldwide on learning to learn
[00:00:07] and a big part of that is note taking
[00:00:10] and I found that the difference between
[00:00:11] a beginner and an experienced notetaker
[00:00:14] comes down to these 16 rules so here's
[00:00:19] 13 years of no BS advice on note taking
[00:00:24] number one write less think more these
[00:00:28] are the notes that I wrote back when I
[00:00:30] was trying to enter into medical school
[00:00:31] all those years ago and I spent hours
[00:00:35] every single day writing these notes
[00:00:37] most of it was a waste of time I now
[00:00:39] spend probably a 20th of the time that I
[00:00:43] used to writing notes and I've never
[00:00:44] been more confident in my learning
[00:00:46] here's the belief that needs to
[00:00:48] evaporate from your brain writing notes
[00:00:51] does not mean you're learning writing
[00:00:53] notes is just an activity there are ways
[00:00:55] of writing notes that help your brain
[00:00:57] think about the material in a certain
[00:00:59] way that helps with the learning but
[00:01:01] there are also ways of writing notes
[00:01:03] that absolutely do not help your brain
[00:01:05] or like you can have your brain
[00:01:06] completely turned off and you can be
[00:01:08] writing notes for hours but what matters
[00:01:09] is what your brain is doing and thinking
[00:01:12] and how it's processing that information
[00:01:15] while you are writing the notes it's an
[00:01:17] active effortful thing if you are
[00:01:19] writing notes and you don't feel like
[00:01:22] your brain is actually actively engaged
[00:01:25] in evaluating and thinking about and
[00:01:26] processing that information you are not
[00:01:29] learning there is isn't some secret
[00:01:30] process happening in the background
[00:01:32] that's making it all work and so if we
[00:01:33] sort of think about the time you spend
[00:01:36] writing notes as one Circle and then
[00:01:38] you've got the time you spend on
[00:01:40] learning in another Circle there is an
[00:01:42] overlap in those Vin diagrams but for a
[00:01:46] lot of people and for how it used to be
[00:01:47] for me that overlap is really really
[00:01:49] small and becoming a bit of notetaker is
[00:01:51] about making that overlap as close to
[00:01:54] just becoming a single Circle as
[00:01:55] possible so if you're writing notes and
[00:01:57] you recognize that your brain is a
[00:01:59] essentially Switched Off you have to
[00:02:01] realize you're wasting your time the
[00:02:03] ideal situation you want to end up at is
[00:02:05] that you are spending most of your time
[00:02:08] thinking
[00:02:09] processing evaluating organizing that
[00:02:12] information and then you're writing your
[00:02:14] notes to help you track that thought
[00:02:17] process and to make that thinking easier
[00:02:19] so if you're in this camp where you
[00:02:21] write a lot of notes here's what you
[00:02:22] should do aim to progressively write
[00:02:25] less and less start by just getting into
[00:02:27] the habit of reducing sentences not
[00:02:29] writing full sentences using more
[00:02:31] keywords summarizing things a little bit
[00:02:33] more tightly start developing shorthand
[00:02:35] use symbols just get less time spent
[00:02:39] finger moving on the page and more time
[00:02:41] spent thinking what to even put on the
[00:02:44] page number two use AI to save time I
[00:02:48] remember in uni they didn't record the
[00:02:51] lectures for us so at the beginning of
[00:02:52] every lecture all the students would go
[00:02:54] down and put their voice recorders like
[00:02:55] lecture recorders on the table well
[00:02:58] doing that and recording it is a lot
[00:03:01] better than writing lots of notes to try
[00:03:03] to keep up when I tell people to write
[00:03:05] less notes one of the big problems that
[00:03:07] people have is that they're afraid
[00:03:09] they're going to miss stuff they're
[00:03:10] afraid they're going to miss detail you
[00:03:12] don't want to be in a position where
[00:03:13] you're using your note taking because
[00:03:15] you need to just document everything the
[00:03:17] only situation where you would do that
[00:03:19] is if there's a lot of information that
[00:03:22] you won't be able to review again later
[00:03:24] like there's no other access to it
[00:03:25] there's no recording that you can review
[00:03:27] you you're not allowed to record it
[00:03:28] yourself like if that is the case and
[00:03:31] you've got like one opportunity to get
[00:03:33] this information then sure you might
[00:03:35] want to type things up you know leave
[00:03:37] much more notes than you normally would
[00:03:38] but if that's not the position you're in
[00:03:40] don't spend your time and effort and
[00:03:42] energy writing notes just for
[00:03:44] documentation purposes record it get the
[00:03:47] recording and then Chuck that recording
[00:03:49] through AI to generate you a summary a
[00:03:52] great tip is to take a recording and
[00:03:54] then to use AI to pull out just the main
[00:03:56] ideas and generate like a single
[00:03:58] paragraph summary at the simple level
[00:04:00] and then that gives you this really
[00:04:02] simple Layman's understanding of the
[00:04:04] topic and it's so much easier to now
[00:04:06] make sense of the more complicated
[00:04:08] technical stuff when you go through it
[00:04:09] in more detail number three ditch the
[00:04:12] highlighter I have a highlighter here
[00:04:14] and and this highlighter that sits on my
[00:04:16] desk I've been using this highlighter
[00:04:18] for like 7 years but if you are going
[00:04:21] and buying a new highlighter like every
[00:04:23] couple months you're definitely doing it
[00:04:25] wrong when you highlight something
[00:04:28] you're basically the deciding that you
[00:04:31] going to forget something important
[00:04:33] you've made the decision that the thing
[00:04:35] you have highlighted is important enough
[00:04:37] to learn but you are not willing to do
[00:04:41] something that allows you to learn it
[00:04:44] instead of spending an hour reading
[00:04:45] through stuff and highlighting all the
[00:04:47] things that you think is important to
[00:04:49] learn just spend the time while you're
[00:04:52] reading it take an extra 20 30 minutes
[00:04:56] make that hour go to an hour and a half
[00:04:57] but actually just learn it right there
[00:05:00] on the spot when you're studying and you
[00:05:01] see something that you feel like you
[00:05:03] would want to highlight instead of
[00:05:05] highlighting it just think about that
[00:05:08] process it write some extra notes do
[00:05:10] some extra reading do things that help
[00:05:12] that information connect with the bigger
[00:05:14] picture do things that give it meaning
[00:05:16] in relation to something else form a
[00:05:18] network using that that's what creates
[00:05:21] good memory that's what helps you to
[00:05:22] develop a strong understanding and you
[00:05:24] can still highlight it if you want but
[00:05:26] the problem with the way that a lot of
[00:05:27] people use a highlighter is that it
[00:05:28] creates this illusion like because I've
[00:05:31] highlighted a bunch of these notes it
[00:05:32] means that okay therefore I've kind of
[00:05:34] studied it but again like the VIN
[00:05:36] diagram of highlighting things versus
[00:05:38] actual learning happening in the brain
[00:05:39] there's almost no overlap between them
[00:05:42] I've done years of undergraduate and
[00:05:45] postgraduate study for high volumes of
[00:05:48] content high levels of detail to
[00:05:50] remember high levels of Mastery
[00:05:52] performed extremely well in my
[00:05:54] assessments without ever using a
[00:05:56] highlighter number four don't copy paste
[00:06:00] when I say copy paste I'm talking about
[00:06:02] uh having someone else's notes having
[00:06:04] something else and like something you
[00:06:05] find online copying that and then
[00:06:07] pasting it into your notes or even a
[00:06:09] diagram like copying a diagram and then
[00:06:11] putting it into notes try to avoid doing
[00:06:14] that copy pasting is like going to a gym
[00:06:19] watching someone else work out and then
[00:06:22] assuming that you're going to get
[00:06:23] stronger remember learning is something
[00:06:25] that has to happen in the brain as a
[00:06:27] byproduct of you thinking about and
[00:06:29] organizing that information in a way
[00:06:31] it's a very active process when we copy
[00:06:34] paste something we're saying hey this
[00:06:35] piece of information is valuable like
[00:06:37] this is useful to know I want that and
[00:06:40] so we put that into our notes but just
[00:06:42] because it's in our notes doesn't mean
[00:06:45] that it's in our knowledge we haven't
[00:06:47] done the workout we haven't done the
[00:06:50] exercise we haven't done any of the
[00:06:52] heavy lifting or thinking about it in
[00:06:54] our brain and so again it creates this
[00:06:56] illusion that like now my notes are
[00:06:57] getting longer bigger there's more INF
[00:06:59] in here we feel more safe and secure in
[00:07:02] our studying even though our knowledge
[00:07:04] has not grown when you see something
[00:07:06] that you feel like this is valuable
[00:07:08] enough for me to copy and paste take a
[00:07:10] little bit longer to extract your own
[00:07:12] meaning from it summarize it paraphrase
[00:07:15] it connect it with something else that
[00:07:17] you have learned turn it into something
[00:07:19] that is truly your own that you have
[00:07:20] really evaluated and when you do this
[00:07:22] not only does it help you to learn that
[00:07:25] actual valuable thing and then create
[00:07:27] notes that are more personalized that
[00:07:28] are more meaningful to you you that
[00:07:30] immediately improve your memory and
[00:07:32] understanding but it also ripples out
[00:07:34] through to everything else that you're
[00:07:35] learning about because every valuable
[00:07:38] piece of information that you would
[00:07:39] normally highlight or copy and paste is
[00:07:41] an opportunity to connect that to the
[00:07:44] bigger picture so everything that you've
[00:07:46] been learning so far gets sort of
[00:07:49] reviewed every time you're thinking
[00:07:51] about how it might connect together this
[00:07:52] younger student that I coached years ago
[00:07:55] I remember she was so proud of her
[00:07:58] notetaking that she had a lot of
[00:08:00] attachment to writing really nice
[00:08:02] looking notes and she would spend like
[00:08:05] literally four or 5 hours a day just
[00:08:07] writing these notes and I asked her okay
[00:08:08] so after these four or five hours let's
[00:08:10] say that you set an exam how well do you
[00:08:12] think you would do and then she said oh
[00:08:13] no like I haven't really started
[00:08:15] learning it yet like I've just written
[00:08:17] the notes and so you never want to get
[00:08:19] to that position where you've actually
[00:08:20] spent hours doing this thing that hasn't
[00:08:22] helped your learning there's no point
[00:08:24] okay well what about diagrams like
[00:08:26] surely it's okay to copy paste a
[00:08:28] flowchart or a diagram into your notes
[00:08:31] even though it can be more timec
[00:08:32] consuming and you may not be bothered to
[00:08:34] try to do it actually creating the
[00:08:37] diagram yourself is a more valuable
[00:08:39] learning opportunity than just copy
[00:08:41] pasting it in the act of seeing a
[00:08:44] diagram trying to understand what you're
[00:08:46] seeing putting it together making sense
[00:08:48] of it to the point where you can
[00:08:50] remember it and actually almost test
[00:08:52] yourself and your ability to recreate it
[00:08:54] into your noes and then check whether it
[00:08:56] was right or wrong that is a much more
[00:08:59] valuable learning activity than copy
[00:09:03] pasting and just like annotating things
[00:09:04] on top it's using a different type of
[00:09:06] learning one is trying to create active
[00:09:08] recall opportunities and the other is
[00:09:10] creating a recognition opportunity
[00:09:13] recognition is basically you just look
[00:09:14] at something and ask yourself okay is
[00:09:17] this right or not like do I recognize
[00:09:20] this piece of information our ability to
[00:09:22] recognize is going to be Sky High it's
[00:09:23] going to be much higher than our ability
[00:09:25] to actually recall it and unless you're
[00:09:27] being tested purely through recognition
[00:09:28] which probably not you're going to need
[00:09:31] that recall ability and so if you need
[00:09:33] to get that recall ability at some point
[00:09:35] you you may as well just do it right now
[00:09:37] when you're first learning it and
[00:09:38] writing your notes number five stop
[00:09:41] color coding when I was in medical
[00:09:43] school I used to have this very specific
[00:09:45] color coding system that I used where
[00:09:49] anything that was an investigation like
[00:09:51] an x-ray or a CT scan or taking some
[00:09:53] blood test that in my notes would always
[00:09:56] be blue and then anything that was a
[00:09:59] treatment would always be green and
[00:10:02] anything that was like a serious
[00:10:04] consequence or a massive risk that would
[00:10:06] be red like you know it all kind of
[00:10:08] makes sense right in a way and if you
[00:10:11] have tried color coding your notes
[00:10:13] before one thing that you'll probably
[00:10:14] realize is that it's actually very
[00:10:16] difficult to remember colors what you
[00:10:19] probably remember is that something was
[00:10:21] probably this color because you have a
[00:10:22] color coding system that you use so you
[00:10:24] know that because this is a treatment it
[00:10:27] probably would have been green but when
[00:10:29] you try to actually
[00:10:31] remember we don't really have a great
[00:10:34] memory of colors in themselves so most
[00:10:37] of the benefit of color coding actually
[00:10:39] comes from the fact that when we learn
[00:10:42] it and write the notes in the first
[00:10:43] place we're forced to make a decision
[00:10:45] about what kind of information this is
[00:10:48] and therefore we choose to color it's
[00:10:49] the decisionmaking part that provides
[00:10:52] most of the value not the fact that it
[00:10:54] was colored and so when I say stop color
[00:10:57] coding I really mean stop only color
[00:11:01] coding or relying on color coding by all
[00:11:05] means use a color coding system in your
[00:11:08] notes it makes it nicer to look at it's
[00:11:10] a more organized experience it's you
[00:11:13] know visually looks nicer that's all
[00:11:15] good like keep doing that but don't
[00:11:18] think that the color coding is a thing
[00:11:19] that really enhances the memory realize
[00:11:21] instead that it's the decision- making
[00:11:23] process that goes into categorizing and
[00:11:26] trying to put that information in the
[00:11:28] context of the the big picture that
[00:11:31] provides the benefit and if we realize
[00:11:34] that we can do more than just color
[00:11:36] coding so if you've ever had this
[00:11:39] experience where you've sat an exam and
[00:11:43] you know the answer to this you know you
[00:11:46] have studied it you know it's in your
[00:11:48] noes and when you think about it you can
[00:11:50] even remember where on the page this
[00:11:53] information is but you just can't
[00:11:55] remember what the information actually
[00:11:58] is this is an example of our spatial
[00:12:01] memory coming into play and so this is
[00:12:03] actually even more powerful than color
[00:12:05] coding and so don't just make decisions
[00:12:06] about what color to make the noes also
[00:12:08] make decisions about where on your page
[00:12:11] you're going to put put this information
[00:12:13] so for example if you've got three
[00:12:14] different concepts that are related to
[00:12:15] each other you can make the decision to
[00:12:18] put those three concepts in a similar
[00:12:20] area of the page even if they might have
[00:12:22] been you know three four pages apart on
[00:12:25] a textbook you can see how making an
[00:12:28] active decision about where on my notes
[00:12:31] should I put this information is
[00:12:33] actually forcing us to evaluate a single
[00:12:35] piece of information against that bigger
[00:12:37] picture it helps us make these
[00:12:39] connections it helps us fit it somewhere
[00:12:41] that it really belongs and form a
[00:12:43] network and so the benefit is we're
[00:12:45] we're improving our memory and our
[00:12:47] understanding through that thought
[00:12:48] process alone and we're also gaining the
[00:12:51] advantage of a spal memory so we've got
[00:12:54] now multiple memory cues to help us
[00:12:57] remember this and then you can also
[00:12:58] color code on top of another quick one
[00:13:00] is thickness of lines and size of text
[00:13:04] you could decide that this concept or
[00:13:07] this group of Concepts is more important
[00:13:09] than this other one and so you
[00:13:11] distinctly make this larger and the
[00:13:14] other one smaller or you might say this
[00:13:16] thing is related to here so you put an
[00:13:17] arrow going through it but you might
[00:13:20] decide that this other relationship with
[00:13:22] another group of Concepts is more
[00:13:24] important and so that Arrow becomes much
[00:13:27] bigger much thicker and so so you're now
[00:13:30] creating many more visual cues for your
[00:13:32] memory while also putting yourself in a
[00:13:35] position where you're forced to make
[00:13:37] these value judgments and decisions
[00:13:39] which promotes deeper thinking better
[00:13:41] processing and therefore better memory
[00:13:43] better performance number six use
[00:13:46] nonlinear notes if you're following the
[00:13:48] advice so far you can see that writing
[00:13:51] notes like typing them out makes a lot
[00:13:53] of these strategies more difficult or a
[00:13:55] lot more timec consuming and that's
[00:13:57] because knowledge fundamentally exists
[00:14:00] in networks that's how our memory is
[00:14:03] organized something stays in our memory
[00:14:06] because it fits into the network or
[00:14:08] schema as sometimes it's called in the
[00:14:09] research and when knowledge does not
[00:14:11] exist in the network or in a schema then
[00:14:14] our brain finds it irrelevant and will
[00:14:15] prune that information it will prune it
[00:14:17] very efficiently sometimes within
[00:14:19] minutes that's why you can read an
[00:14:20] entire page get to the bottom of the
[00:14:22] page maybe have even written notes for
[00:14:24] it but literally like 5 minutes later
[00:14:27] you just forgot what you spent
[00:14:29] you know 20 minutes reading through on
[00:14:31] that page that's because our brain is
[00:14:33] very very good at pruning irrelevant
[00:14:35] information and in fact it's that
[00:14:36] ability that helps keep our brain alive
[00:14:40] otherwise there'll be this extreme
[00:14:42] energy consuming organ just trying to
[00:14:45] hold on to every single piece of
[00:14:46] information that it's hit with every
[00:14:47] single day like it's an important
[00:14:49] function of the brain and you're not
[00:14:50] going to be able to fight that like it's
[00:14:52] biologically programmed in so when we
[00:14:54] use nonlinear notes we're actually
[00:14:56] leaning into a biological tendency
[00:14:59] instead of fighting against it we're
[00:15:00] saying hey you want to like hey brain
[00:15:03] you want to organize this information in
[00:15:06] a network you want to create a schema
[00:15:07] out of it that's how it's going to make
[00:15:08] sense to you I'm going to help you to do
[00:15:10] that by representing that and thinking
[00:15:12] in networks as well through my
[00:15:14] notetaking as opposed to thinking about
[00:15:17] things linearly and then getting your
[00:15:18] brain to somehow like almost
[00:15:20] subconsciously piece things together and
[00:15:23] some people can uh subconsciously piece
[00:15:26] things together pretty well and and
[00:15:28] those people are usually the ones that
[00:15:30] are like just more naturally intelligent
[00:15:33] uh but you can also just train your
[00:15:35] ability to do that as well and you can
[00:15:37] make it a more active process using
[00:15:38] nonlinear notes is also the key to
[00:15:41] reducing how volume heavy the notes are
[00:15:44] and I'll give you just a really really
[00:15:45] quick example let's say I write some
[00:15:47] notes that look like this so when you
[00:15:48] look at this it looks fairly simple but
[00:15:52] if you were to try to express What's
[00:15:54] Happening Here in sentences and through
[00:15:56] linear notes then it would sound
[00:15:58] something like a leads to B when C and D
[00:16:04] combine to create e and then e
[00:16:07] influences a so if you look at that like
[00:16:10] as a series of words and then you
[00:16:13] compare that to this you can see that
[00:16:16] this image is actually much faster and
[00:16:19] easier to process what's going on even
[00:16:21] though it's actually the same
[00:16:22] information being communicated and it
[00:16:24] scales too like for example if we start
[00:16:26] introducing uh a few more Concepts STS
[00:16:29] here and now it looks like this okay
[00:16:30] it's getting a little bit more
[00:16:31] complicated but it's still much more
[00:16:33] intuitive to follow than adding on like
[00:16:35] an additional thing like however once e
[00:16:37] influences a a then goes back to
[00:16:39] reinforce e but only in the presence of
[00:16:41] f which is interchangeable with G you
[00:16:43] know you can see like and then when you
[00:16:45] review the notes reading through that
[00:16:48] and then like mentally trying to process
[00:16:50] that it just takes so much longer and so
[00:16:52] much more effort in fact studies say
[00:16:53] that it takes about 40,000 times longer
[00:16:57] to process than looking at something
[00:17:00] that's more visual that's just because
[00:17:01] our brain is much better at uh
[00:17:03] processing visual information than um
[00:17:05] just just written words and really when
[00:17:07] you read it what you're trying to do
[00:17:10] mentally is actually pretty much
[00:17:12] reconstruct this in your brain so you
[00:17:15] can see if you just skip the part where
[00:17:17] it's linear to begin with and you just
[00:17:19] construct it to look like this from the
[00:17:21] first place then when you review your
[00:17:23] notes when you think about it when you
[00:17:24] test yourself it's all just very aligned
[00:17:27] it's just making a lot easier for your
[00:17:28] brain to hold on to and understand that
[00:17:30] information so if you are a heavy linear
[00:17:32] Note Taker and you want to transition to
[00:17:34] being able to do more nonlinear note
[00:17:35] taking then I recommend doing it in
[00:17:37] steps so you would go from writing just
[00:17:40] less words more shorthand reducing your
[00:17:42] sentences more bullet points then start
[00:17:44] adding a few arrows in things connecting
[00:17:47] ideas in your linear notes so okay maybe
[00:17:49] this bullet point is connected to this
[00:17:50] bullet point you're just creating tiny
[00:17:52] little flows and then compress that down
[00:17:55] even more just start working with
[00:17:57] keywords just main IDE ideas and create
[00:18:00] little mini Maps within your notes once
[00:18:03] you get more comfortable with that
[00:18:04] expand that out try to just get more and
[00:18:06] more of that information through a
[00:18:08] nonlinear note taking method and then
[00:18:10] naturally at some point you just feel
[00:18:12] like you don't really need the linear
[00:18:13] notes anymore cuz you realize it's just
[00:18:15] not providing you any value by the way
[00:18:18] if you are getting value from these tips
[00:18:20] and you're enjoying these then you may
[00:18:22] also want to check out my free Weekly
[00:18:24] Newsletter every week I send you more

[00:18:38] a b learner the news data is completely
[00:18:40] free to sign up to so if you're
[00:18:42] interested I'll leave a link in the
[00:18:44] description for you now on to the next
[00:18:46] note taking tip number seven try the
[00:18:48] Corell method the Corell note taking
[00:18:51] method is this quite popular note taking
[00:18:54] method that came out of Cornell
[00:18:55] University uh and for for good reason uh
[00:18:57] the idea is that you just take a single
[00:18:59] page and you divide it up into these
[00:19:01] different sections on one side you have
[00:19:04] something called cues on the bottom you
[00:19:07] have a summary and then on the right
[00:19:11] column you've got your sort of main body
[00:19:13] of notes and the idea is that you write
[00:19:15] your normal sets of notes and then in
[00:19:18] the cues you actually leave yourself
[00:19:20] like interesting prompts and questions
[00:19:22] about what you're writing notes on and
[00:19:24] then at the bottom you summarize the
[00:19:26] stuff above it so you you create a
[00:19:28] synthesize summary of it and I'm
[00:19:30] actually a fan of this method I don't
[00:19:32] think it's a good end goal for writing
[00:19:34] notes but I think it's a phenomenal
[00:19:36] transitionary step that helps you to go
[00:19:39] from being a more passive notet taker
[00:19:42] writing lots of notes and putting you a
[00:19:43] little bit more in the driver's seat
[00:19:45] forcing you to engage your brain more
[00:19:47] critically and really think about and
[00:19:49] process that information you can also
[00:19:50] combine this with what I was saying
[00:19:53] before in terms of transitioning from a
[00:19:55] linear to a nonlinear style you can
[00:19:57] start adding certain nonlinear aspects
[00:19:59] within your notes or you can even make
[00:20:01] your summaries at the bottom of the page
[00:20:04] into little mini mind maps as well now
[00:20:07] again this is not the end goal you do
[00:20:09] want to get to a point where just doing
[00:20:10] it the nonlinear way is effective enough
[00:20:13] for you because the main benefit of the
[00:20:16] cor now note taking method is not in
[00:20:18] this part which is writing your notes it
[00:20:20] is in being curious exploring the
[00:20:23] information connecting things together
[00:20:25] and being able to actually produce the
[00:20:27] summary like that's actually where the
[00:20:29] value of the method comes in so the less
[00:20:32] of this stuff you can get away with and
[00:20:34] the more of thinking summarizing
[00:20:37] synthesizing and exploring the cues
[00:20:39] thinking of these questions the more of
[00:20:41] that you can spend your time doing the
[00:20:43] closer that VIN diagram gets in terms of
[00:20:46] the time you spend on not taking versus
[00:20:47] the time you spend on learning number
[00:20:50] eight use digital free form note taking
[00:20:54] apps I want you to imagine trying to
[00:20:57] rearrange a warehouse like a warehouse
[00:21:00] full of packages let's say you've got a
[00:21:02] package that needs to be sent over to
[00:21:04] Berlin over here but then you've got
[00:21:06] another one that needs to be sent to
[00:21:07] Australia over here and you're thinking
[00:21:09] okay well I'd like to move all the stuff
[00:21:12] that's being sent to Australia in the
[00:21:14] pile with all the other Australian
[00:21:15] packages and I want to move this Berlin
[00:21:17] one you know over here alongside the
[00:21:19] other European countries like let's say
[00:21:21] that you want to organize your warehouse
[00:21:23] this way but imagine that every time you
[00:21:27] want to reorganize the packages in your
[00:21:31] Warehouse you have to demolish the
[00:21:34] warehouse and then Build It Again from
[00:21:36] scratch and then fill in all the
[00:21:38] packages again this is what it's like
[00:21:41] trying to learn effectively while you're
[00:21:45] note taking in a fixed linear set of
[00:21:48] notes when you normally write notes in a
[00:21:50] fixed way especially if it's linear you
[00:21:52] create this structure of ideas that
[00:21:55] connect together in a certain way and so
[00:21:57] if you decide hey actually I think this
[00:21:59] idea connects more with this thing and
[00:22:01] I'd rather place it over here and I
[00:22:03] connect it through this thing and I
[00:22:04] actually think this part here that I
[00:22:06] wrote before is incorrect and I want to
[00:22:08] revise that or add even more detail into
[00:22:10] it you have to actually pretty much like
[00:22:13] write the notes again which is fine if
[00:22:15] you've got plenty of time but if you are
[00:22:17] running short on time that in itself is
[00:22:20] not only a huge time waste but just the
[00:22:22] thought that you need to do that and
[00:22:24] like rebuild it again can be enough to
[00:22:26] make you feel like you just can't be
[00:22:28] bothered and then you're missing this
[00:22:30] valuable incredibly important learning
[00:22:33] opportunity but when you use a digital
[00:22:35] app for this you just write the notes
[00:22:37] and then you realize you want to move it
[00:22:39] around you can delete it or you can just
[00:22:40] like lasso it like literally move it
[00:22:42] somewhere else and like connect it again
[00:22:44] and it is a small thing but if you can
[00:22:47] afford to get yourself a tablet with a
[00:22:49] writing stylus then it is legitimately a
[00:22:54] valuable investment and there are many
[00:22:56] things that are in the learning space
[00:22:59] that I would say that if you just put
[00:23:01] money into it it just immediately
[00:23:03] provides you value but using a digital
[00:23:07] note taking app that is free form with
[00:23:11] Infinite Canvas that lets you really
[00:23:13] move the ideas around is very valuable a
[00:23:17] lot of note taking apps on tablet are
[00:23:19] like it's it's basically the same as
[00:23:21] paper but just digital like it's you've
[00:23:24] still got an A4 size you've still got
[00:23:26] these lines on the page the only
[00:23:28] difference is that like it's infinite
[00:23:29] scrolling for example useless don't use
[00:23:32] that I don't have any of them installed
[00:23:34] even if those are the apps that you use
[00:23:37] it probably means that there's something
[00:23:38] else in terms of the advice I've given
[00:23:40] about not taking that you're not
[00:23:41] following and the good thing is that if
[00:23:43] you do end up getting an iPad and this
[00:23:46] is not a plug for Apple by the way but
[00:23:49] uh Apple does actually have native to it
[00:23:52] an app called free form and free form is
[00:23:55] a Infinite Canvas nonlinear note taking
[00:23:59] app and I've played around with it
[00:24:00] enough to tell you that it is
[00:24:02] legitimately a very good option
[00:24:05] especially given that it just comes
[00:24:07] bundled with your tablet to begin with
[00:24:10] in fact I even had the privilege of
[00:24:12] being invited in bu Apple uh as one of
[00:24:14] the early users to give my feedback on
[00:24:17] the app and how useful I think it is
[00:24:19] number nine zoom out often let me draw
[00:24:23] something for you
[00:24:25] [Music]
[00:24:34] so I used to be like kind of a little
[00:24:37] bit into my art and as you can see my
[00:24:38] skills have not exactly improved by much
[00:24:40] uh over the last several years but one
[00:24:43] thing that I noticed is that when I drew
[00:24:46] these faces I would get really detailed
[00:24:49] and I'd like zoom into things a lot and
[00:24:51] I'd like add a bunch of this detail like
[00:24:53] for example let's say we go down to the
[00:24:54] nose and I'd create like what I think is
[00:24:57] like a nice looking like nostal and then
[00:24:59] I'd create like what I think is this you
[00:25:00] know like a nice looking sort of smile
[00:25:02] and i' create like what what I think
[00:25:03] would be a nice looking eye and then I'd
[00:25:05] zoom out and i'
[00:25:07] realize it just looks terrible like the
[00:25:10] proportions are out of work like this
[00:25:12] what is this eye even
[00:25:13] doing and the reason I'm showing you
[00:25:16] this terrible drawing is to show you
[00:25:18] that there are a lot of things that you
[00:25:20] can't detect when you're Zoomed In Too
[00:25:24] Close and this is especially true when
[00:25:26] it comes to learning because when you
[00:25:28] think about learning something
[00:25:31] especially if it's detailed dense uh
[00:25:34] difficult conceptual information a lot
[00:25:36] of your effort is spent on really trying
[00:25:38] to understand what it's talking about
[00:25:40] and often an easier way of understanding
[00:25:44] it is to actually find the things
[00:25:47] related to it that you already
[00:25:50] understand that you can connect it to
[00:25:52] and so when I say zoom out often it
[00:25:55] means that yes spend time going into the
[00:25:57] detail s spend time understanding it and
[00:26:00] wrapping your head around it do that
[00:26:03] fine but every now and again zoom out
[00:26:06] and just connect what you've been
[00:26:08] working on with the bigger picture is
[00:26:11] there somewhere else that this should
[00:26:12] fit is this similar to anything else
[00:26:15] does it connect or influence or is
[00:26:17] influenced by some other concept and
[00:26:21] surprisingly
[00:26:22] often very important connections and
[00:26:26] influences and ways of understanding it
[00:26:28] that would have made it so much easier
[00:26:30] for you and would help you to hold on to
[00:26:32] and retain this information are not
[00:26:34] taught to you outright it's not
[00:26:37] mentioned in the textbook the lecturer
[00:26:38] never said that but when you zoom out
[00:26:40] you give yourself the opportunity to
[00:26:43] look for these additional connections
[00:26:44] and it means that by the time you finish
[00:26:46] the study session you actually end up
[00:26:48] with a set of knowledge that you feel
[00:26:50] really comfortable with like you see how
[00:26:52] it's all organized you see how it fits
[00:26:54] together you feel confident and you just
[00:26:56] feel like it's locked into your memory
[00:26:58] as opposed to getting to the end of a
[00:26:59] study session and feeling man I covered
[00:27:02] so much stuff it's overwhelming I hope I
[00:27:04] don't forget this but you know you are
[00:27:07] already starting to forget it number 10
[00:27:09] emphasize the important points before I
[00:27:12] talked about how you shouldn't copypaste
[00:27:14] diagrams into your notes and one of the
[00:27:16] reasons that you really don't need to is
[00:27:19] because diagrams that you draw into your
[00:27:22] notes don't actually have to be textbook
[00:27:26] accurate the reason is because
[00:27:28] your brain doesn't remember things with
[00:27:31] perfect accuracy anyway so let me give
[00:27:34] you an example so let's say that this is
[00:27:37] a diagram okay this is a diagram of a
[00:27:41] very poorly drawn diagram of not an egg
[00:27:44] uh is actually meant to be a
[00:27:46] cell so if this is a diagram that you
[00:27:49] draw and this is you know let's just say
[00:27:50] it looks like this in your textbook when
[00:27:52] you remember this and you recall it you
[00:27:55] may redraw it and recall something that
[00:27:57] looks like this okay and you might look
[00:28:00] at this and this is what you recall so
[00:28:02] if we compare what we have been able to
[00:28:04] remember and recall from the diagram
[00:28:06] with the actual original diagram you can
[00:28:08] see that there are some subtle
[00:28:09] differences for example I've missed this
[00:28:12] one I've missed this I've missed this
[00:28:14] and actually did you notice that there
[00:28:15] are these tiny little bumps on this so
[00:28:18] you can see that these are very small
[00:28:20] subtle details but because our brain is
[00:28:22] not remembering things like perfectly
[00:28:25] like a robot it means that the things
[00:28:27] that are more likely to be forgotten
[00:28:30] should be more exaggerated and so we can
[00:28:33] know that it's not in reality like this
[00:28:37] but we can use it as a memory aid by
[00:28:40] exaggerating the diagram so an
[00:28:41] exaggerated version of this diagram
[00:28:43] where I am focusing on these highrisk
[00:28:45] areas that I might forget might look
[00:28:48] like this so now you can see that it's
[00:28:51] completely not factually accurate I mean
[00:28:53] I've turned those bumps into little
[00:28:55] houses that sit on grass I've turned
[00:28:57] those tiny little things up here into
[00:28:59] like angry caterpillars and I turn that
[00:29:03] small little hole up here into like a
[00:29:05] like a Vortex so you can see I've
[00:29:07] actually made the decision that these
[00:29:09] things are important enough to remember
[00:29:12] and high risk of forgetting so I've
[00:29:14] overcompensated by making them less
[00:29:16] factually accurate but more memorable
[00:29:20] and so as long as I remember that it's
[00:29:21] not literally a house or a angry
[00:29:24] caterpillar or a Vortex it's a Memory
[00:29:26] cue for helping remember the thing that
[00:29:29] is actually accurate and we can even do
[00:29:31] this when we write like nonlinear mind
[00:29:33] maps as well we can actually use that
[00:29:35] spatial memory and that visual coding to
[00:29:37] enhance our ability to remember
[00:29:39] something so for example let's say we've
[00:29:41] got a coming here leading to B and then
[00:29:44] off of a there are three points so I
[00:29:46] could write those three points like this
[00:29:49] alternatively I could represent those
[00:29:51] three points let's just do that again I
[00:29:54] could represent those three points like
[00:29:56] this
[00:30:04] there's no real big difference one of
[00:30:06] them is bullet points underneath the a
[00:30:08] the other one is like arrows coming from
[00:30:10] underneath the a they seem roughly the
[00:30:12] same but let's start adding a few more
[00:30:14] points so let's say coming off from B
[00:30:15] there are two points so now we've got B
[00:30:18] with two points now I want you to think
[00:30:21] about being able to remember this
[00:30:23] structure that we've created right here
[00:30:25] versus really INF EMP izing that a has
[00:30:29] three versus B having two and instead of
[00:30:33] using numbers we're using spatial
[00:30:35] arrangement to represent that so that
[00:30:37] might look something like
[00:30:46] this so if you look at this
[00:30:49] one the shape itself becomes more
[00:30:52] distinctive and it means that we might
[00:30:54] remember this top one and the the bottom
[00:30:57] one but then we just we know there's
[00:30:59] something here we know there's a third
[00:31:01] one because the shape is like that we
[00:31:04] remember there was something there and
[00:31:05] then that can help us to review it and
[00:31:08] recall it and eventually perform with
[00:31:10] that knowledge whereas if we had the
[00:31:11] former one you'd be forgiven if you
[00:31:14] remember two of these and then you just
[00:31:16] kind of forgot that there's a third one
[00:31:18] because it just all looks the same
[00:31:20] number 11 right questions I remember my
[00:31:24] first few lectures in University and
[00:31:27] thinking the volume of information being
[00:31:31] thrown at me in this 1eh hour lecture is
[00:31:33] like what would normally have Tak taken
[00:31:36] me like two to three weeks during high
[00:31:39] school and the reason I'm telling you
[00:31:40] this is because there is a strategy for
[00:31:41] dealing with high volumes of dense
[00:31:44] information there are basically two
[00:31:46] decisions that you can make when you're
[00:31:47] in that position decision number one I'm
[00:31:49] going to try to get all of it down write
[00:31:52] my notes on it like just collect as much
[00:31:54] of that information that decision is
[00:31:56] saying I'm foro me trying to learn it
[00:31:59] now in favor of setting up myself later
[00:32:04] to learn it and again sometimes you have
[00:32:06] to do that because you don't have access
[00:32:08] to the material later and so like this
[00:32:10] is your one and only shot but the other
[00:32:12] part that you can take is that you can
[00:32:14] try to engage in this process of like
[00:32:16] fitting it into the big picture and
[00:32:18] evaluating and thinking about how it all
[00:32:20] connects together and like making sense
[00:32:22] of the overarching the topic as a
[00:32:25] network and realize that it's too fast
[00:32:28] for you to finish those thoughts and
[00:32:31] explore those things right now so you
[00:32:34] start exploring them and then you write
[00:32:36] questions for yourself to prompt your
[00:32:38] studying later so I might be sitting
[00:32:40] there in a lecture and I'm listening to
[00:32:41] a bunch of stuff and I have this feeling
[00:32:44] like this thing and this thing could be
[00:32:45] connected but I don't have time right
[00:32:47] now to think about it too much or to
[00:32:49] really explore that so that becomes a
[00:32:51] question is this and this connected and
[00:32:53] if so how and then I'd write that down
[00:32:55] separately so now after this lecture
[00:32:58] I would have a dedicated study session
[00:33:00] where I'm starting off with the
[00:33:01] questions that I've created and then
[00:33:04] answering those questions is what helps
[00:33:06] me to figure out how it all connects
[00:33:08] together and then I can build my network
[00:33:10] and build my schema now if you are going
[00:33:11] to write questions I want you to
[00:33:13] remember that not all questions are
[00:33:16] equal some questions are less valuable
[00:33:19] than others and often the less valuable
[00:33:21] questions are the ones that ask on just
[00:33:23] a single isolated fact like creating the
[00:33:26] question what's the definition of this
[00:33:29] word that's a very isolated specific qu
[00:33:33] question that question is not going to
[00:33:34] do much for you because how does that
[00:33:37] help you to form a network and build a
[00:33:40] relationship because you could ask the
[00:33:42] question of how does this relate to this
[00:33:45] other concept and in trying to answer
[00:33:47] that You' figure out the definition
[00:33:49] anyway so you can see we're getting the
[00:33:51] benefit of the specific definition but
[00:33:54] also how that word fits in with
[00:33:57] something else the definition has
[00:33:59] meaning it has relevance it has
[00:34:01] importance that creates much more
[00:34:03] structure in our memory number 12 avoid
[00:34:07] flow charts a lot of the time when
[00:34:10] people start writing nonlinear notes
[00:34:12] they actually start writing flowcharts
[00:34:15] instead of mind maps and there's
[00:34:18] actually a really big difference between
[00:34:19] them let's say I create a flow of
[00:34:21] knowledge that looks like this so here
[00:34:24] this is a flowchart now it's nonlinear
[00:34:27] it's connected to each other what's the
[00:34:30] problem the problem is that it creates a
[00:34:33] very high dependency it's kind of like
[00:34:36] that drawer on your back party game you
[00:34:39] get a bunch of people in a line and the
[00:34:41] person at the very front of the line uh
[00:34:43] is shown a picture of something and so
[00:34:46] that person will turn around and then on
[00:34:48] the back of the person that's next in
[00:34:50] line they'll draw the picture and so
[00:34:53] this person has to like figure out
[00:34:55] what's being drawn based on their
[00:34:57] sensation of their own back and then
[00:35:00] they will then draw on the back of the
[00:35:03] next person and then you figure out what
[00:35:05] picture you end up with at the very end
[00:35:07] and usually after like five people just
[00:35:09] drawing on backs the person at the very
[00:35:11] end like ends up drawing like a muffin
[00:35:14] and then the initial picture was like a
[00:35:15] spaceship and this is basically what we
[00:35:18] are doing with our memory if we do flow
[00:35:21] charts if the only reason you remember e
[00:35:25] is because it's led to by D which is led
[00:35:29] to by C which is led to by B which
[00:35:31] starts from a it means that any point of
[00:35:34] failure along this line means that you
[00:35:36] also diminish the memory of what comes
[00:35:39] after that so you want to avoid this by
[00:35:41] looking for more lateral connections and
[00:35:43] then grouping these ideas together so
[00:35:44] there's less of a chain so for example
[00:35:47] this thing I could say A and B are kind
[00:35:49] of doing the same thing and then C and D
[00:35:51] are sort of doing the same thing like a
[00:35:53] similar purpose so I might call this
[00:35:55] Alpha and beta for this example and i'
[00:35:57] say
[00:35:58] Alpha leads to Beta which leads to e and
[00:36:02] Alpha is composed of A and B and then
[00:36:06] beta is composed of c and d so you can
[00:36:09] see that just by grouping the
[00:36:11] information and looking for these
[00:36:12] similarities it reduces how much
[00:36:15] dependency there is on this chain and we
[00:36:17] might also decide that hey actually you
[00:36:19] know Alpha is influenced by something
[00:36:21] else and you know somewhere else on the
[00:36:23] map and then we can start creating even
[00:36:25] more of these kind of lateral
[00:36:26] connections between other ideas and so
[00:36:29] it goes from a linear flow chart to a
[00:36:33] real Network and a Web of Knowledge
[00:36:36] number 13 apply the 24hour rule the
[00:36:40] 24-hour rule says that you should review
[00:36:43] the notes that you have written within
[00:36:45] 24 hours of First writing them this is
[00:36:48] mostly for when the first time you wrote
[00:36:51] the notes is also the first time you
[00:36:52] properly try to learn it the reason this
[00:36:54] works is because memory has a very fast
[00:36:58] Decay curve this means that something
[00:36:59] that you learn is forgotten relatively
[00:37:02] quickly in a pretty short period of time
[00:37:04] and if you're able to consolidate and
[00:37:06] re-encode that information before it
[00:37:08] decays it's strengthened and it decays
[00:37:11] more slowly afterwards so let's say that
[00:37:13] you spent one hour learning something on
[00:37:16] a Monday but you don't review it again
[00:37:17] until the next Monday well there's been
[00:37:20] a weak Gap and if you've forgotten let's
[00:37:23] say 50 to 70% of it then you now need to
[00:37:26] spend let's say another hour hour or 45
[00:37:28] minutes relearning and reeming the stuff
[00:37:31] that you already forgot so now for that
[00:37:33] 1 hour material you'll spent almost 2
[00:37:36] hours to study it whereas if you use the
[00:37:38] 24-hour rule you might spend one hour
[00:37:40] learning it on the Monday and then on
[00:37:43] the Tuesday you review it again now
[00:37:45] because you've only forgotten 10% of it
[00:37:47] since then you only need 5 10 minutes to
[00:37:51] plug those gaps so now when it comes to
[00:37:54] next Monday instead of having forgotten
[00:37:56] 50 to 70% of it you might have only
[00:37:58] forgotten 20% of it but obviously this
[00:38:00] cumulates so you're not just learning 1
[00:38:02] hour on a Monday you're learning like 3
[00:38:04] hours on Monday and then 3 hours on
[00:38:05] Tuesday and then 3 hours on Wednesday so
[00:38:07] if the future version of you always
[00:38:08] needs to spend another one or two hours
[00:38:11] to relearn the things that you always
[00:38:13] forgot you're just going to get
[00:38:14] progressively further and further behind
[00:38:16] and more and more overwhelmed now one
[00:38:18] thing I will say is that the value of
[00:38:20] the 24-hour Rule and how much it helps
[00:38:23] with your memory and how much time it
[00:38:24] saves you in the long run strongly
[00:38:27] depends on the way that you learned it
[00:38:30] in the first place if you learned it
[00:38:31] really terribly you didn't follow any of
[00:38:33] the other tips that I've given and all
[00:38:34] you do is the 24-hour rule after a week
[00:38:37] you will still have forgotten 50 to 70%
[00:38:39] of it if that's the situation the
[00:38:40] problem is not how often you're
[00:38:42] reviewing it the problem is how you're
[00:38:44] actually trying to put it into your
[00:38:45] memory in the first place number 14
[00:38:48] write notes by topics not by lectures
[00:38:52] imagine you're building a
[00:38:55] house but you can only build it one
[00:38:59] section at a time like you start with
[00:39:02] the master bedroom and then you just
[00:39:04] build it like completely the walls you
[00:39:06] do the paint like it's completed but
[00:39:08] like the entire rest of the house isn't
[00:39:10] there and then you go and build the
[00:39:12] kitchen you complete that and then after
[00:39:15] each of these segments is completed then
[00:39:17] you try to like bring them together and
[00:39:20] like close them together and maybe you
[00:39:22] realize like you built the kitchen in
[00:39:24] the wrong place you got to like relocate
[00:39:26] the entire kitchen and then everything
[00:39:27] breaks and Cheddars and you know it's a
[00:39:29] complete mess there's a reason we don't
[00:39:31] build houses that way and it's the same
[00:39:33] reason why you shouldn't learn that way
[00:39:34] as someone who has lectured when we
[00:39:37] think about a lecture the number one
[00:39:39] thing that we start with is the time
[00:39:42] constraint how much time do I have to
[00:39:45] cover this topic so it's not that the
[00:39:47] topic is innately divided into these 1
[00:39:52] hour conceptual blocks the topic is
[00:39:54] actually all connected together that's
[00:39:56] why it's called topic and not like two
[00:39:58] or three different topics and there are
[00:40:01] meaningful valuable connections between
[00:40:04] the different lectures the only issue is
[00:40:06] that there isn't enough time in a single
[00:40:08] lecture to go over all of them and so if
[00:40:10] you start writing your notes based on
[00:40:13] lectures rather than based on topics and
[00:40:16] so you've got a set of notes for lecture
[00:40:17] one and then a set of notes for lecture
[00:40:19] two and then a set of notes for lecture
[00:40:20] three then you're creating an artificial
[00:40:23] division between parts of the topic and
[00:40:26] the reason you don't want to do that
[00:40:27] that is because there could be something
[00:40:29] that you learn in lecture three that
[00:40:31] allows you to understand something from
[00:40:32] lecture one in such a way that it makes
[00:40:34] more sense and it has more of a place to
[00:40:36] fit you don't want to forego that
[00:40:40] connection opportunity because the notes
[00:40:43] for lecture 3 existed on a separate page
[00:40:45] to lecture one so how do you bring it
[00:40:49] all together into a single set of notes
[00:40:51] when you are actually taught it segment
[00:40:54] by segment well that's advice number 15
[00:40:58] create a template AKA do some pre-study
[00:41:01] think back to the house analogy in what
[00:41:03] kind of situation do you think you would
[00:41:05] end up building a house room by room
[00:41:09] without really thinking about how it all
[00:41:10] connects together and then later being
[00:41:12] forced to just somehow make it work well
[00:41:15] one scenario is that you built the house
[00:41:18] and you started building it without a
[00:41:20] blueprint and pre-study or priming is
[00:41:24] one way that you can give yourself that
[00:41:26] blueprint
[00:41:27] so that even if you don't know exactly
[00:41:29] in detail everything that you're going
[00:41:31] to learn and how it all connects
[00:41:33] together you at least have more of an
[00:41:35] idea about what types of things to
[00:41:37] expect in the entire topic and you can
[00:41:40] at least make guesses and hypothesis
[00:41:42] about how one concept might relate to
[00:41:44] something else that you haven't learned
[00:41:46] yet so what this looks like is before a
[00:41:49] week of lectures you just spend 20
[00:41:52] minutes going through the most important
[00:41:55] things in all of the lectures at a very
[00:41:57] superficial level you just map out how
[00:41:59] you think the most important ideas might
[00:42:01] be connected together and you give
[00:42:02] yourself this Frame a skeleton this is
[00:42:05] the template and now that you have this
[00:42:07] template you can go into that first
[00:42:10] lecture and elaborate on you can build
[00:42:13] on that same set of notes and because as
[00:42:16] you're filling information in you have
[00:42:18] an awareness of the other stuff that you
[00:42:19] haven't covered yet you can start
[00:42:22] thinking okay maybe this thing will fit
[00:42:24] into somewhere over here maybe it could
[00:42:26] connect over here and that's what makes
[00:42:28] it easier to create these topic wide
[00:42:30] connections even if you're learning at
[00:42:33] one lecture at a time number 16 turn
[00:42:35] your weak points into flashcards if you
[00:42:38] follow all the pieces of advice that
[00:42:40] I've given you so far then you will be
[00:42:42] able to create a set of nonlinear
[00:42:44] connected notes and the beauty of doing
[00:42:46] this is that it becomes a visual
[00:42:48] representation of How It's organized in
[00:42:50] your mind which means you can look at
[00:42:53] your notes and look for areas that seem
[00:42:57] less connected there could be a stray
[00:42:59] piece of information over in the corner
[00:43:02] somewhere that's only got one random
[00:43:04] sort of tenuous connection going to it
[00:43:07] that is going to become a weak point in
[00:43:09] your memory cuz there's less memory cues
[00:43:11] there's less areas that's relevant it
[00:43:14] doesn't fit into the big picture as
[00:43:15] strongly if your brain's going to prune
[00:43:17] something is it going to prune the
[00:43:19] central idea that six other things are
[00:43:21] connected to and it's a prerequisite for
[00:43:23] this other major concept or is it going
[00:43:25] to prune that random little detail
[00:43:27] that's just barely connected to this
[00:43:29] other concept way in the periphery those
[00:43:32] pieces of information are more highrisk
[00:43:34] and if it's important enough for you to
[00:43:36] know put those into flash cards and this
[00:43:38] is also the way of using flash cards
[00:43:40] that helps you to be confident that
[00:43:42] you're not going to miss anything all
[00:43:44] the little details that you feel like oh
[00:43:46] I'm not sure if I'm going to remember
[00:43:47] that that's fine that's what goes into
[00:43:49] your flashcards but by doing all the
[00:43:51] other stuff and writing notes in a more
[00:43:54] targeted way with more of the time spent
[00:43:56] writing notes creates learning it means
[00:43:59] that you're not in that position where
[00:44:02] everything you learn is something you
[00:44:04] think you're going to forget and as with
[00:44:05] any skill all of this stuff you will get
[00:44:07] better as you keep practicing more so
[00:44:09] that's it this has been your nobs

=== How To Boost Your Learning By 89% (explained in 4 minutes) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebgl_3MlXM8

[00:00:00] hey I'm Dr Justin sun and over the last
[00:00:02] decade I've coached over 25,000 Learners
[00:00:04] and what I've realized is that many
[00:00:06] students and Learners waste 90% of their
[00:00:10] time studying and learning because of
[00:00:12] something called passive learning and in
[00:00:14] this video I want to share with you a
[00:00:16] simple but powerful method called
[00:00:18] cognitive load regulation which will
[00:00:21] help you to delete this passive learning
[00:00:23] and save thousands of hours throughout
[00:00:26] your life so here is what you need to do
[00:00:28] use cognitive load to delete passive
[00:00:32] learning cognitive load is the fancy
[00:00:34] term for mental effort effective
[00:00:38] learning always involves mental
[00:00:42] effort passive learning is the type of
[00:00:45] learning that doesn't involve High
[00:00:48] mental effort and in fact it's not
[00:00:51] really even learning so rewriting notes
[00:00:55] is fairly passive if you're just writing
[00:00:57] it again word for word reread in things
[00:01:00] is also fairly passive and different
[00:01:03] techniques on that spectrum of how much
[00:01:06] studying turns into learning have
[00:01:08] different levels of mental effort
[00:01:10] associated with them and generally the
[00:01:11] more effective ones have more mental
[00:01:13] effort so for example creating summary
[00:01:16] pages is more effective and then turning
[00:01:18] those summary pages into something
[00:01:19] that's nonlinear and relational takes a
[00:01:21] little bit more e effort and then
[00:01:23] teaching it to a 10-year-old and
[00:01:25] simplifying those relationships and
[00:01:27] groups that takes even more eff it and
[00:01:28] this is simply just be because the
[00:01:31] learning is what happens in your brain
[00:01:34] so your brain has to do thinking and
[00:01:37] processing to turn information into
[00:01:39] relevant knowledge it takes effort and
[00:01:43] the way we feel that that mental
[00:01:46] exertion that's what we call cognitive
[00:01:48] load and now not everything that has
[00:01:51] high cognitive load makes it effective
[00:01:53] like for example if all you wanted to do
[00:01:55] was max out your cognitive load you can
[00:01:58] stand on like a stand on one while
[00:02:00] you're juggling and someone's slapping
[00:02:02] you in the face with a fish while you
[00:02:04] read a textbook your cognitive load is
[00:02:06] going to be through the roof but it's
[00:02:08] not going to make a difference to your
[00:02:09] learning and so not all high cognitive
[00:02:12] load is effective learning but all
[00:02:15] effective learning involves higher
[00:02:17] cognitive load but whenever your
[00:02:18] cognitive load is low you can know for
[00:02:22] sure that you not engaging in effective
[00:02:25] learning and so you want to be able to
[00:02:27] train yourself to be aware when you are
[00:02:30] studying what's the level of mental
[00:02:32] exertion cognitive load that I'm feeling
[00:02:35] and if it's high okay that's fine right
[00:02:38] if it's low there's a high high high
[00:02:41] likelihood that you're doing passive
[00:02:43] learning and those need to be massive
[00:02:46] red flags that you look at and optimize
[00:02:48] or just completely remove that out of
[00:02:50] your learning system and in fact you can
[00:02:52] even do a quick test have a study
[00:02:55] session for like one or two days and
[00:02:57] then identify the techniques and the
[00:02:59] methods that you use where you feel that
[00:03:01] your brain is entering into that passive
[00:03:03] State it's feeling boring it's feeling
[00:03:05] tedious it's feeling monotonous you're
[00:03:07] kind of falling asleep and getting
[00:03:09] drowsy uh those are areas where your
[00:03:12] brain is basically falling
[00:03:14] asleep just try studying a topic without
[00:03:17] doing any of that stuff just literally
[00:03:20] remove it from your system and you know
[00:03:22] what you will probably find that there
[00:03:24] is no real difference to how much you
[00:03:28] learn and youve saved
[00:03:30] that much time and some of you will do
[00:03:32] this and be like well man that's like
[00:03:34] 90% of all my studying feels like that
[00:03:37] you know surely my learning has gone
[00:03:39] down nope it just means that 90% of the
[00:03:43] time me spent on studying was kind of a
[00:03:46] waste of time and I'm saying that from
[00:03:48] the position where that used to be me so
[00:03:51] much of my learning was passive and it
[00:03:53] took me a very long time longer than
[00:03:57] hopefully it will take you with my
[00:03:58] videos uh to fix that and make it more
[00:04:01] active if you want more of these tips
[00:04:03] then check out the full video here where
[00:04:04] I break down 13 years of studying advice
[00:04:07] into a single video


=== How To Become A Genius (Explained In 5 Levels) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTOFa5BX6qs

[00:00:00] I've been a learning coach for over a
[00:00:01] decade and I've realized there are five
[00:00:03] levels of Learners starting from
[00:00:05] beginner through to genius and at each
[00:00:08] level of learner you face a different
[00:00:11] type of problem and it's only when you
[00:00:13] overcome these problems do you progress
[00:00:16] to the next level so today I'll show you
[00:00:18] how you can identify which level of
[00:00:20] learner you are and I'll teach you how
[00:00:23] you can progress to become a level five
[00:00:25] learner we'll start with level one which
[00:00:27] is the beginner when you're a beginner
[00:00:30] you're really not studying at all and so
[00:00:32] you're going to get poor results or
[00:00:34] inconsistent results at least and it's
[00:00:36] not going to be sustainable when things
[00:00:38] get tough and so the problem you have as
[00:00:40] a beginner I simply call chaos just
[00:00:44] completely not in control and the way
[00:00:46] that you go from level one to level two
[00:00:48] is very simple all you need to do is
[00:00:50] just study more the answer is spend more
[00:00:54] time and just by going from studying 1
[00:00:57] hour to 5 hours you already become a
[00:01:00] level two learner this part is very
[00:01:02] simple at level two you are what I'd
[00:01:04] call a novice learner you know you're at
[00:01:07] level two when you are putting in a
[00:01:09] reasonable amount of effort and you're
[00:01:10] doing better than doing nothing the
[00:01:13] learning strategies people commonly use
[00:01:15] in this level are writing lots of notes
[00:01:18] and lots of repetition based learning so
[00:01:21] for example rereading notes rewriting
[00:01:23] notes rewatching or Rel listening to
[00:01:25] lectures and the main strategy the main
[00:01:28] solution for overcoming problem problems
[00:01:30] or difficulties achieving a more
[00:01:32] difficult goal and learning is just
[00:01:34] spending more time when the going gets
[00:01:37] tough if your main solution is to just
[00:01:40] study more then you're probably in this
[00:01:43] level which means you'll probably also
[00:01:45] have the problems of level two Learners
[00:01:47] which is
[00:01:50] leaking and what we're talking about
[00:01:52] here is a leaking memory at level two
[00:01:56] you're doing lots of studying which
[00:01:57] means you're taking lots of information
[00:01:59] in however our brain and our memory is
[00:02:02] very good and very efficient at removing
[00:02:04] any knowledge that it thinks it doesn't
[00:02:06] need to hold on to if it's not relevant
[00:02:08] or connected enough so what you will
[00:02:09] feel is a very high rate of what's known
[00:02:12] in the research as knowledge Decay which
[00:02:14] is just forgetting things which the
[00:02:16] research suggests for an average learner
[00:02:18] and the average learner is at level two
[00:02:21] after about a week they would forget
[00:02:23] around 50 to 70% of what they studied
[00:02:25] the week before now your rate of
[00:02:27] knowledge Decay AKA how fast you forget
[00:02:29] things depends a lot of different
[00:02:30] factors but one of the most important
[00:02:32] factors is how you actually process and
[00:02:34] organize that information in the first
[00:02:36] place when you first learned it now just
[00:02:38] studying more hours doesn't mean you
[00:02:40] actually process and organize that
[00:02:41] information any better it just means you
[00:02:43] have more poorly organized stuff so it's
[00:02:46] just more things you will forget but
[00:02:49] usually there are certain subjects or
[00:02:52] certain Concepts that for whatever
[00:02:54] reason we're able to connect to a little
[00:02:56] bit more easily sometimes we have more
[00:02:57] knowledge about it sometimes we can
[00:02:59] create an analogy out of it that other
[00:03:01] people just couldn't see sometimes it's
[00:03:02] just taught to us a little bit more
[00:03:04] easily and so another problem that we'
[00:03:06] find is that our results are very
[00:03:08] inconsistent and variable we can study a
[00:03:10] lot for one subject and then do poorly
[00:03:12] and then study even less for another one
[00:03:14] but actually do better for some reason
[00:03:16] and so our results will fluctuate a lot
[00:03:18] depending on just how natural it feels
[00:03:21] if you have a high studying workload at
[00:03:23] level to You'll also have the problem of
[00:03:25] feeling quite overwhelmed with the
[00:03:27] amount of stuff that you need to manage
[00:03:29] you've got lots of information coming in
[00:03:31] you have to remember a lot of it you
[00:03:33] realize you're forgetting a lot of it
[00:03:34] and so there's this constant burden of
[00:03:36] trying to relearn the things that you've
[00:03:39] forgotten over time this also increases
[00:03:41] the risk of burning out just from that
[00:03:43] high volume and it also increases the
[00:03:45] risk of anxiety uh stress and
[00:03:48] frustration due to those inconsistent
[00:03:49] results and so while just studying more
[00:03:52] and spending more time was the thing
[00:03:54] that got you from level one to level two
[00:03:56] before when things were easier that's
[00:03:59] not going to be the thing that gets you
[00:04:00] from level two to level three the
[00:04:02] strategy that gets us to level three is
[00:04:05] going to
[00:04:06] be smart
[00:04:12] repetition and we're essentially talking
[00:04:14] about using strategies like active
[00:04:16] recall and space repetition for those of
[00:04:18] you that aren't familiar active recall
[00:04:19] simply just means testing Yourself by
[00:04:21] recalling things from your memory from
[00:04:24] the things that you've learned before
[00:04:25] and then space repetition just means
[00:04:27] that you repeat and review the material
[00:04:30] that you have previously learned on some
[00:04:32] kind of regular interval so if you
[00:04:33] learned something on a Monday then you
[00:04:34] may review it again on a Wednesday and
[00:04:36] then on a Saturday and then on a Sunday
[00:04:38] and probably the most common and
[00:04:40] actually pretty effective strategy that
[00:04:42] ticks the boxes of active recall and
[00:04:44] space repetition are to use flash cards
[00:04:47] and so once we're doing the smart
[00:04:48] repetition we are in level three
[00:04:54] intermediate at this level you are
[00:04:56] actually more active and thoughtful
[00:04:58] about the learning strategy you're using
[00:05:00] you're not just about putting in more
[00:05:02] time and just doing more and more you're
[00:05:05] thinking about using a strategy that's
[00:05:06] meant to be more effective for the time
[00:05:09] that you're putting in and you're more
[00:05:10] targeted you realize you had an issue
[00:05:12] with leaking memory so you're
[00:05:14] implementing a strategy to prevent the
[00:05:16] leaking as a result you'll often find
[00:05:18] that as you do this repetition your
[00:05:20] retention and your memory also improves
[00:05:23] at this level as an intermediate level
[00:05:25] learner you can usually get through a
[00:05:28] lot of your
[00:05:30] common learning challenges uh you can
[00:05:32] get through most high school curriculum
[00:05:34] you can go through University uh and
[00:05:37] unless you're really aiming for those
[00:05:38] top marks you may not really notice uh
[00:05:41] much of an issue here it will certainly
[00:05:43] be better than what you were doing
[00:05:44] before and if your natural processing
[00:05:47] ability is also very high you can also
[00:05:50] end up getting quite good results just
[00:05:52] at this level with nothing else now on a
[00:05:55] day-to-day basis at this level your
[00:05:57] studying usually consists of of still
[00:06:00] writing quite a lot of notes but instead
[00:06:03] of just doing Bland repetition of
[00:06:06] rereading or rewriting we're doing a lot
[00:06:08] of that repetition through flash cards
[00:06:11] utilizing active recoil so it's a more
[00:06:13] effective form of repetition but for
[00:06:15] many of you uh the average person who
[00:06:18] doesn't have very very high depressing
[00:06:21] skills or for even if you do have great
[00:06:24] de processing skills at some point in
[00:06:26] your life when it does become
[00:06:27] challenging enough the workload is high
[00:06:29] enough and it's difficult enough you
[00:06:32] will run into these problems and the
[00:06:34] problems at level three are what I call
[00:06:38] Plateau when you plateau you will
[00:06:41] realize the limits of just repetition
[00:06:44] based learning in general and there's
[00:06:46] usually two main things that I observe
[00:06:48] in the students that I coach that reach
[00:06:50] this Plateau the first is that they are
[00:06:52] spending a lot of time on their flash
[00:06:55] cards and doing the repetition they're
[00:06:57] entering into what I call space
[00:06:58] repetition overload it's to the point
[00:07:01] where there are so many things that they
[00:07:03] need to do their repetition on and
[00:07:05] they've got such a big backlog and an
[00:07:08] existing workload of stuff that they're
[00:07:10] not even able to get through all their
[00:07:12] space repetition in the first place so
[00:07:14] they're falling behind on their
[00:07:15] repetition schedule I've often heard
[00:07:17] people talk about it like a endless
[00:07:19] grind or like a hamster wheel of flash
[00:07:22] cards and I can relate to that feeling
[00:07:24] intimately well because that was my
[00:07:26] entire life for my first year of
[00:07:28] University which is why I also know that
[00:07:30] staying in that situation facing these
[00:07:33] problems means that you're still at a
[00:07:36] very high risk of burning out which is
[00:07:38] indeed what happened to me and the worst
[00:07:40] part about the plateau is that it's
[00:07:42] almost impossible to really hit the
[00:07:45] highest levels of knowledge depth and
[00:07:47] Mastery using these strategies so it
[00:07:50] means even if you do more flash cards
[00:07:52] and even if you spend more time studying
[00:07:54] those tricky curveball questions the
[00:07:56] real complex problems to try to solve uh
[00:07:59] being able to engage in those really
[00:08:01] deep meaningful discussions or write
[00:08:03] like those really amazing essays that
[00:08:06] still is Out Of Reach and that's because
[00:08:09] to be able to do that level you actually
[00:08:13] have to think in a different way to how
[00:08:16] we're thinking about learning up until
[00:08:18] this point and so to graduate and solve
[00:08:21] these Plateau problems it's not about
[00:08:24] spending more time or doing more
[00:08:27] repetition we have to now Focus Fus on
[00:08:33] quality as I said before one of the most
[00:08:35] important factors for how leaky your
[00:08:37] memory is is how well we process and
[00:08:39] organize that information in the first
[00:08:41] place otherwise your brain is going to
[00:08:42] very efficiently remove it so quality is
[00:08:44] about how well we do that processing and
[00:08:48] organizing we have so far said that hey
[00:08:51] we've got a leaky bucket but with smart
[00:08:53] repetition as long as I can have a cup
[00:08:55] underneath it to catch the water and
[00:08:57] then fill the bucket back up we can keep
[00:09:00] that bucket relatively topped up the
[00:09:02] problems with plateau and that overload
[00:09:04] that's basically us no longer being able
[00:09:07] to keep up with how much water is
[00:09:09] leaking out so this is the point at
[00:09:11] which we start plugging those leaks and
[00:09:13] when we focus on quality there's
[00:09:15] actually two ways that we can do this
[00:09:18] the first way is that we improve the
[00:09:20] quality of the encoding process encoding
[00:09:23] is a technical term for taking new
[00:09:25] knowledge and then putting it into our
[00:09:26] long-term memory when we do high quality
[00:09:28] encoding it helps us to keep that
[00:09:30] knowledge in our brain for longer it's
[00:09:32] easier to retain it and the process that
[00:09:36] we use to organize it that results in a
[00:09:40] better memory also drives a deeper level
[00:09:43] of understanding which means those
[00:09:45] curveball questions those complex
[00:09:47] problems that beautiful essay that we
[00:09:50] really struggled to reach we can now
[00:09:52] reach that level because we're starting
[00:09:54] to think at that level so the strategies
[00:09:57] involved with improving your coding
[00:10:00] these are going to be things like
[00:10:01] exploring higher order thinking and
[00:10:03] higher order learning that I constantly
[00:10:05] talk about in all my other videos it
[00:10:06] probably means changing up your note
[00:10:08] taking to use something that's a little
[00:10:10] bit more relational one of the high
[00:10:12] yield strategies you can add at this
[00:10:13] point is also to start doing some basic
[00:10:16] pre-study to familiarize yourself with
[00:10:18] complex Concepts before doing a deep
[00:10:22] study session or before attending a
[00:10:23] lecture and that helps to give your
[00:10:25] brain a bit of a head start in
[00:10:27] organizing and processing this comp
[00:10:29] licated concept but the second part of
[00:10:31] quality is that we can also improve the
[00:10:33] quality of our spaced repetition and
[00:10:37] active recoil sessions so instead of
[00:10:38] just doing more flash cards of the same
[00:10:42] flash cards and just doing more and more
[00:10:43] of those we can actually improve the
[00:10:46] quality of the type of repetition we're
[00:10:48] doing to graduate from level three and
[00:10:51] get to level four you should start using
[00:10:53] some kind of active flash card
[00:10:55] management method where you're actively
[00:10:57] pruning the flash cards that you don't
[00:11:00] need so you're not just keeping this
[00:11:02] huge backlog and you're also changing
[00:11:05] your flash cards as they get too easy to
[00:11:08] make sure you're consistently testing
[00:11:09] yourself at the right level if you're
[00:11:11] already great at recalling some of these
[00:11:13] basic facts then start merging some of
[00:11:15] those together to test yourself in a
[00:11:17] more complex way how do these two facts
[00:11:19] relate to each other try to use them for
[00:11:22] some basic problem solving you should
[00:11:24] also start doing more diverse types of
[00:11:26] testing in the first place this means
[00:11:28] applying your knowledge in more complex
[00:11:31] ways or in ways that you feel like you
[00:11:33] may be assessed doing practice questions
[00:11:35] making your own practice questions
[00:11:37] swapping practice questions that you
[00:11:39] made within your friend group uh just
[00:11:41] applying your knowledge and just like
[00:11:43] executing it in the real world these are
[00:11:46] all ways of testing your knowledge
[00:11:49] actively recalling it from your memory
[00:11:51] finding gaps that you can go in and
[00:11:53] review in a more targeted way and not
[00:11:55] only does this help by giving you that
[00:11:58] repetition but it also helps you to
[00:12:00] re-encode that information into your
[00:12:03] memory more strongly than it initially
[00:12:06] was encoded so even if you didn't encode
[00:12:08] it very well the first time around and
[00:12:09] so your memory is very leaky it gives
[00:12:12] yourself this opportunity to look at the
[00:12:14] concepts again for a second time and ask
[00:12:17] yourself how could I organize this
[00:12:19] information to make it more meaningful
[00:12:21] how can I apply this in the real world
[00:12:23] and give this information more context
[00:12:26] and so by doing these things not only
[00:12:28] does it improve the quality of our
[00:12:29] encoding which means that we have less
[00:12:32] to forget but it also means that when we
[00:12:34] do our repetition it's more effective
[00:12:36] and once you're able to do this as part
[00:12:39] of your everyday Learning System day in
[00:12:42] day out you have officially become a
[00:12:44] level four learner which we'll simply
[00:12:46] just call
[00:12:49] Advanced now as an advanced learner the
[00:12:51] main thing is that you're able to reach
[00:12:55] those higher levels of Mastery that were
[00:12:58] very difficult to reach in the lower
[00:13:00] levels in the lower levels sure you may
[00:13:03] be able to have good retention on facts
[00:13:05] but those trickier applications the
[00:13:07] deeper knowledge applications they were
[00:13:10] always Out Of Reach as an advanced
[00:13:12] learner because you are actively
[00:13:14] thinking in a more advanced way in a
[00:13:17] more connected way and you're actively
[00:13:19] testing yourself at a higher level you
[00:13:21] are able to reach that level now you'll
[00:13:24] also notice that your memory is just
[00:13:25] generally better and you just don't need
[00:13:28] as much rep repetition anymore when you
[00:13:30] do the repetition it's also a completely
[00:13:32] different experience in the lower levels
[00:13:34] repetition was just about getting
[00:13:36] through as much content and work as
[00:13:38] possible hoping you're going to remember
[00:13:41] all of this and hoping there aren't any
[00:13:43] gaps anywhere as an advanced learner
[00:13:45] when you do the repetition you're much
[00:13:47] more targeted you're able to find gaps
[00:13:50] in your knowledge very quickly and then
[00:13:51] fill them in the right way at this point
[00:13:53] you're probably doing a moderate amount
[00:13:56] of note taking and you're doing much
[00:13:58] more th
[00:13:59] compared to writing this indicates the
[00:14:02] important transition of an advanced
[00:14:03] Learner in that they care more about how
[00:14:06] they are thinking about the information
[00:14:08] than what they are writing about the
[00:14:10] information your notes are probably a
[00:14:12] little more organized but they organize
[00:14:14] nonlinearly because you've realized that
[00:14:16] using nonlinear note taking like mind
[00:14:19] mapping is much more effective at
[00:14:21] showing complex relationships which is
[00:14:24] where the value of learning really lies
[00:14:26] you are testing yourself very
[00:14:27] strategically at a variety of different
[00:14:30] complexities and levels and when you use
[00:14:32] the flash cards you are using them very
[00:14:34] strategically as well just to mop up
[00:14:36] these lower level very specific details
[00:14:39] that don't fit anywhere else flash cards
[00:14:41] are now being used for its best purpose
[00:14:44] naturally as an advanced level four
[00:14:46] learner you should also be getting very
[00:14:48] good and very consistent predictable
[00:14:50] results you should feel much less
[00:14:52] anxiety about learning or doing
[00:14:54] assessments because you have so much
[00:14:57] control over your outcome now some of
[00:14:59] you might be thinking how is this only
[00:15:01] level four out of five like what I
[00:15:04] wouldn't give to just be at level four
[00:15:07] how do I just get to level four forget
[00:15:08] about level five I just want level four
[00:15:11] and I've got some good news is that you
[00:15:14] can get to level four pretty quickly and
[00:15:16] one of the things that will help you is
[00:15:18] my free Weekly Newsletter but seriously
[00:15:20] in my years of coaching I have seen some
[00:15:22] students struggle to move through these
[00:15:25] different levels for years and I went
[00:15:28] through a lot of these same struggles
[00:15:29] myself and so I've distilled down what I
[00:15:32] think are some of the most important
[00:15:33] pieces of advice important perspectives
[00:15:36] techniques and strategies for learning
[00:15:39] that I think are the most impactful to
[00:15:41] help you move through these levels
[00:15:43] there's an email every week it's
[00:15:44] completely free if you're interested
[00:15:46] I'll leave a link for you to sign up to
[00:15:48] that in the description below but now
[00:15:49] let's move on to the problems of an
[00:15:52] advanced learner because even an
[00:15:54] advanced learner has problems and the
[00:15:56] most common problem here is
[00:16:01] inconsistency what a level four Advanced
[00:16:04] learner will often find and this is what
[00:16:06] I found I probably hit this stage around
[00:16:08] my fifth year of medical school is that
[00:16:12] you know everything you need to do and
[00:16:15] if you do those things the outcome is
[00:16:18] very consistent the problem is that
[00:16:21] doing all the right things and learning
[00:16:23] in the right way is timec consuming
[00:16:26] sometimes and so when we don't have
[00:16:28] enough time unexpected things pop up it
[00:16:30] makes a big impact to your ability to
[00:16:32] perform and so what ended up happening
[00:16:34] for me and I see this often with my
[00:16:35] students is that in those situations we
[00:16:39] actually revert down to a lower level
[00:16:41] instead of doing what we know we should
[00:16:43] do because of that stress and the
[00:16:45] pressure uh we end up just reverting to
[00:16:47] something that feels easier to do which
[00:16:50] is actually less effective and damages
[00:16:52] in the long run and so while you have
[00:16:54] the tools to do very well and you know
[00:16:56] how to use them what's in consistent is
[00:17:00] how consistently you can actually use
[00:17:03] the tools this is especially true in
[00:17:06] fastpaced learning environment so for
[00:17:08] example if you're in a workshop or a
[00:17:09] lecture and you've got lots of
[00:17:11] information delivered to you at a high
[00:17:14] density and you don't have a lot of your
[00:17:16] normal adjuncts for learning so you're
[00:17:18] sort of bombarded with this information
[00:17:20] and you're not really sure what you
[00:17:22] meant to do with this at that point we
[00:17:24] revert to our younger University self
[00:17:27] where we just like mindlessly typ as
[00:17:29] many notes as possible to give our
[00:17:30] future self a chance and so to graduate
[00:17:33] from level four to become level five the
[00:17:36] trick here is we optimize and that was
[00:17:40] meant to be a picture of a
[00:17:44] wrench right you can see that it's a
[00:17:46] beautiful wrench so optimizing your
[00:17:48] learning system means removing
[00:17:51] unnecessary old habits of learning and
[00:17:53] then replacing them with better ones
[00:17:55] it's taking everything that we're
[00:17:56] already doing and then just upgrading
[00:17:58] them and then turning them into habits
[00:18:00] so that we can do them faster with less
[00:18:02] effort specifically in this transition I
[00:18:05] tend to see people start using more
[00:18:07] comprehensive methods of nonlinear note
[00:18:10] taking it's deeper and goes into more
[00:18:12] details it's more organized and they're
[00:18:14] able to do it more quickly they're
[00:18:16] continuing to do active flash card
[00:18:18] management and and good types of testing
[00:18:20] like they were before but they are
[00:18:22] upgrading their actual higher order
[00:18:25] thinking skills so that becomes more
[00:18:27] habitual and easier to think at those
[00:18:29] higher levels more consistently what
[00:18:31] goes hand inand with this is being much
[00:18:33] more aggressive about identifying when
[00:18:37] we start thinking in a more isolated
[00:18:40] ineffective lower order way and stomping
[00:18:43] those habits out and finally one of the
[00:18:45] most important Transformations that has
[00:18:47] to happen to go from a level four to a
[00:18:49] level five which is to become the
[00:18:51] mechanic of your own brain this involves
[00:18:54] constantly monitoring the way that we
[00:18:56] are learning and understanding how do
[00:18:58] does me using this technique affect my
[00:19:01] memory and my level of understanding
[00:19:03] with the time and resources that I have
[00:19:05] available if I do less of this how's it
[00:19:07] affected if I do more of it if I
[00:19:08] introduce this additional technique
[00:19:10] we're monitoring our Learning System and
[00:19:12] we are monitoring our own situation and
[00:19:15] we're starting to understand how to push
[00:19:17] and pull different levers to adapt our
[00:19:20] Learning System for different types of
[00:19:22] challenges as you can imagine going from
[00:19:24] a level four to a level five uh usually
[00:19:27] takes a considerable amount of time time
[00:19:29] because unlearning old habits is a
[00:19:31] arduous process but once you have gotten
[00:19:34] into level five the coveted genius level
[00:19:38] of learner you're able to learn High
[00:19:40] volumes difficult Concepts very
[00:19:43] effectively uh you're able to hold on to
[00:19:46] that information with a high level of
[00:19:48] retention and in a shorter time than the
[00:19:50] average person and you can also adapt
[00:19:53] and overcome as your learning situation
[00:19:56] changes it's at this level that people
[00:19:58] will look at you and think how are you
[00:20:00] able to do that we've got the same
[00:20:01] number of hours in a day how are you
[00:20:02] doing so much more than I am well the
[00:20:04] answer is moving through these steps so
[00:20:08] what problem could a genius level
[00:20:12] learner possibly have well the main
[00:20:16] problem at this level is
[00:20:19] bordedom and I'm actually serious here
[00:20:22] is that I've had students who they got
[00:20:24] to a level of their learning where they
[00:20:26] were able to tackle their curriculum so
[00:20:29] fast that they already finished their
[00:20:30] entire Year's worth of study and it's
[00:20:32] only like March or April and they're
[00:20:34] asking me what do I do now like I don't
[00:20:38] I literally have so much free time I
[00:20:40] don't even know what to do and so I'll
[00:20:43] give you the advice that I gave to that
[00:20:46] student which is just do more things
[00:20:50] enjoy life explore what life is when
[00:20:53] it's not all consumed by studying in
[00:20:55] other words I guess what I'm saying is
[00:20:57] that once you reach this point your real
[00:20:59] solution is just to
[00:21:01] live laugh and love so I hope that helps
[00:21:05] you figure out which level of learner
[00:21:07] you are and what you need to do to get
[00:21:08] to the next level thanks so much for
[00:21:10] watching and don't forget to live laugh
[00:21:13] love

=== How I Changed My Life in 1 Year with Reverse Goal Setting ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6QQDy1OUhE

[00:00:00] on May 26th 2019 I left my job as a
[00:00:04] medical doctor I felt dissatisfied and
[00:00:07] unhappy with life dreading Sunday
[00:00:10] evenings knowing that I'd have to wake
[00:00:12] up the next day for work but just one
[00:00:14] year later I became the most fulfilled
[00:00:16] and energized version of myself I'd ever
[00:00:19] been and I achieved this transformation
[00:00:21] through a powerful method I call reverse
[00:00:24] goal setting and now as a learning coach
[00:00:26] for the past 13 years reverse goal
[00:00:29] setting is the method that I teach to
[00:00:31] thousands of students and professionals
[00:00:33] worldwide to help them plan and build
[00:00:35] out their dream lives in this video I'm
[00:00:38] going to explain what the biggest
[00:00:40] problems with normal or conventional
[00:00:42] goal setting are and how you can fix
[00:00:45] those problems with the five steps of
[00:00:47] reverse goal setting let's get started
[00:00:49] more often than not normal goal setting
[00:00:52] can be a complete waste of time that's
[00:00:54] why most people who set goals don't
[00:00:57] really achieve them especially for goals
[00:01:00] that are even slightly more difficult
[00:01:02] you end up getting stuck in the spiral
[00:01:04] of setting a goal trying to achieve it
[00:01:07] failing getting derailed feeling
[00:01:09] demotivated wondering what's wrong with
[00:01:11] me why can't I keep achieving these
[00:01:12] goals it's like this spiral that gets
[00:01:14] worse and worse with every goal you set
[00:01:16] but I really think this is because of
[00:01:18] the way we set our goals not because of
[00:01:21] who we are so back when I was in my
[00:01:23] first year of University this is me I
[00:01:26] had this goal of entering into medical
[00:01:28] school and so I knew that I wanted to do
[00:01:31] everything possible to achieve that goal
[00:01:33] and so I thought what can I do to get
[00:01:36] into Medical School study more study
[00:01:38] harder read all the textbooks be a good
[00:01:41] diligent student and so my plan on a
[00:01:43] daily basis revolved around how can I
[00:01:46] make sure I do these activities day in
[00:01:50] day out and that's what normal ghost
[00:01:51] Ting kind of looks like you have this
[00:01:53] overall intention where you want to end
[00:01:55] up and then you think well what can I do
[00:01:57] that gets me closer to it and then you
[00:01:59] think how can I fit that into my
[00:02:00] schedule how can I be diligent and you
[00:02:02] use that to Anchor your activities every
[00:02:04] single day and for a simple enough goal
[00:02:08] this works fine and actually if I think
[00:02:11] back to my success of entering into
[00:02:14] medical school I technically reached my
[00:02:16] goal but I think really I just got lucky
[00:02:18] because there were also a lot of other
[00:02:20] people around me working just as hard
[00:02:22] doing kind of the same things but they
[00:02:24] weren't as successful some of them very
[00:02:26] intelligent very capable people and this
[00:02:28] is really the problem with noral goal
[00:02:30] setting is that it focuses on the what
[00:02:33] to achieve but not the how if you set a
[00:02:37] goal the path of actually achieving that
[00:02:41] is very unclear so you have to spend a
[00:02:42] lot of time trying to figure it out not
[00:02:45] only is that a waste of time and a waste
[00:02:46] of energy but sometimes you never even
[00:02:48] make it to the end because you burnt out
[00:02:50] you lost your way you ran out of time
[00:02:52] and I really think that at a certain
[00:02:54] point in life normal goal setting
[00:02:58] becomes a waste of time because for most
[00:03:00] complicated goals you don't know how
[00:03:03] you're meant to actually achieve it it's
[00:03:04] the uncertainty that makes it hard in
[00:03:06] the first place a good example is if I
[00:03:08] fast forwarded 9 years I've already
[00:03:11] graduated Medical School I've become a
[00:03:13] doctor I've been working as a doctor and
[00:03:15] now ironically I'm trying to create a
[00:03:18] goal to leave medicine I want to explore
[00:03:20] entrepreneurship and and education
[00:03:23] full-time so I've set that as my goal I
[00:03:25] want to become an entrepreneur and
[00:03:27] educator
[00:03:28] full-time so what like what am I
[00:03:30] actually meant to do you can see how
[00:03:33] setting the goal doesn't give me any
[00:03:35] more clarity on how to achieve that and
[00:03:38] this is where reverse ghting comes in to
[00:03:39] fix this problem is that it starts with
[00:03:41] the goal that you want to achieve and it
[00:03:43] works its way backwards to give you a
[00:03:45] very clear path of action that you know
[00:03:49] will inevitably lead to you achieving
[00:03:52] your goal so now let me show you what
[00:03:53] the five steps of reverse goal setting
[00:03:55] are and how you can use that to achieve
[00:03:58] your goals with more CL CL ity and
[00:04:00] confidence step one identify your
[00:04:03] long-term goal you can't plan for an
[00:04:06] outcome if you don't know what outcome
[00:04:08] you want on the other hand just because
[00:04:12] you know what outcome you want doesn't
[00:04:14] mean you can create a plan to achieve it
[00:04:17] there's this awesome analogy that I
[00:04:19] heard from this legendary marketer
[00:04:21] called Seth Goden he said if you want to
[00:04:24] hang a painting on on the wall like a
[00:04:27] really nice painting that you love right
[00:04:30] into your bedroom and you go to the
[00:04:32] hardware store to pick up a drill and a
[00:04:35] drill bit your goal there is not to buy
[00:04:39] a drill and a drill bit your goal is to
[00:04:43] have a hole in the wall so that you can
[00:04:46] put a screw through that to hang your
[00:04:48] painting on it but your goal is not to
[00:04:51] have a hole in the wall your goal is to
[00:04:54] have the painting on the
[00:04:57] wall but your goal is also not to have
[00:05:00] the painting on the wall your goal is to
[00:05:05] have a certain feeling that you think
[00:05:07] you will have when you see that painting
[00:05:10] on the wall that's your real goal your
[00:05:13] goal is the feeling you think that that
[00:05:15] will give you and I think this applies a
[00:05:17] lot for the life goals that we set when
[00:05:19] I was 15 thinking I want to be a
[00:05:23] doctor that was a goal that I had in
[00:05:25] mind but it's not that I wanted to be a
[00:05:28] doctor there were all these other
[00:05:30] criteria in my mind that I was checking
[00:05:32] off that I attached to that goal a level
[00:05:36] of financial stability a level of
[00:05:39] fulfillment in my life a type of work
[00:05:41] that I thought I would enjoy and be good
[00:05:43] at and 10 years later after having
[00:05:47] achieved that goal what I realized is
[00:05:49] that it didn't take some of those boxes
[00:05:53] as much as I would have wanted it didn't
[00:05:55] provide me as much fulfillment and
[00:05:58] satisfaction as I I thought it would
[00:06:00] give me the work was not what I had
[00:06:02] anticipated it to be and the moral of
[00:06:04] the story here is not to go back in time
[00:06:06] slap my 15 15-year-old 16-year-old self
[00:06:09] and say think harder about your goal
[00:06:11] it's that when you look so far ahead
[00:06:14] there are so many levels of uncertainty
[00:06:17] there's so much you don't know about
[00:06:19] yourself your life situation about the
[00:06:21] goal itself that it becomes almost
[00:06:23] meaningless to Anchor that in as a goal
[00:06:26] and so as a general principle I think
[00:06:29] what's in ibly useful for goal setting
[00:06:31] is don't set goals too far into the
[00:06:34] future because your plan is almost
[00:06:37] definitely going to change and you want
[00:06:39] to stay flexible and adaptable and open
[00:06:42] to new information and new circumstances
[00:06:45] you don't want to get locked down into a
[00:06:47] certain pathway because you said this is
[00:06:50] the goal I've chosen for myself and even
[00:06:52] though information keeps coming in
[00:06:53] saying hey what you really want is this
[00:06:55] thing and what you thought was a goal is
[00:06:57] not going to get you there you want to
[00:06:58] be able to Pivot on that so here's a
[00:07:00] little activity for you just get a piece
[00:07:02] of paper out and write down what your
[00:07:05] long-term Vision or direction is this is
[00:07:09] like your 5 to 10 year Vision try to
[00:07:12] keep this one relatively
[00:07:15] broad underneath that right why what do
[00:07:19] you think this is going to achieve for
[00:07:22] you what type of feeling what kind of
[00:07:24] situation will this help you achieve and
[00:07:26] make a clear decision mentally that if
[00:07:29] you realize at some point that this what
[00:07:33] the goal you've set now is no longer
[00:07:36] seeming like it's going to tick off the
[00:07:39] why the reason for setting the goal in
[00:07:41] the first place give yourself permission
[00:07:43] to re-evaluate pivot once you've done
[00:07:46] that break that go down into something
[00:07:48] that's a little bit more medium-term at
[00:07:50] most 3 years in advance and you can
[00:07:54] actually bring this as short as you want
[00:07:56] like you could do this exact same
[00:07:57] process for a month of away if your goal
[00:08:00] is I want to get to the supermarket
[00:08:01] tomorrow morning you don't need to do
[00:08:04] this whole process just just just go to
[00:08:06] the supermarket but if it's further than
[00:08:07] 3 years your plan starts becoming very
[00:08:09] risky if one part of the plan breaks it
[00:08:11] affects everything else for the rest of
[00:08:13] that plan it's much better to just plan
[00:08:16] for shorter Sprints and then just
[00:08:18] constantly re-evaluate that as you go
[00:08:20] now in Step number four we want to
[00:08:21] actually specify what is required to
[00:08:24] achieve this goal like what is the
[00:08:25] actual requirements that you need to
[00:08:27] achieve so for example for me it was
[00:08:29] entering into medical school for me to
[00:08:31] achieve that there was a certain grade
[00:08:32] boundary there were these other
[00:08:33] examinations that I had to have set
[00:08:35] clearer more specific targets now when
[00:08:37] you do this activity especially if it's
[00:08:39] a goal that you're not very certain
[00:08:40] about there's an important answer that
[00:08:43] you may arrive at which is incredibly
[00:08:46] important for you to write down which is
[00:08:48] you may realize that when you try to
[00:08:49] specify you don't
[00:08:53] know you have a goal you want to reach
[00:08:55] but you don't actually know what the
[00:08:58] requirements are this is important
[00:09:00] because it highlights a gap in your
[00:09:03] planning your immediate Next Step
[00:09:05] becomes figure that out go learn about
[00:09:07] it talk to someone get that information
[00:09:09] so you know and you can actually specify
[00:09:11] it accurately now up until this point
[00:09:14] this all falls within the same purview
[00:09:16] of just normal goal
[00:09:18] setting this step two is where we really
[00:09:23] go into reverse goal setting step two is
[00:09:27] to Define your future self imagine your
[00:09:31] goal is to have a million dollars and
[00:09:36] you find a magic lamp and you can rub
[00:09:38] the lamp and a genie comes out and says
[00:09:40] hey I will grant you you know your one
[00:09:42] wish and then you say I wish I could win
[00:09:46] Lotto and have a million
[00:09:49] dollars that would not be a great wish
[00:09:53] in fact actually when you look at a lot
[00:09:54] of Lotto winners they don't end up
[00:09:58] continuing to be wealthy a lot of people
[00:10:00] that win these great sums of money just
[00:10:03] eventually lose all that money again why
[00:10:06] is that it's because they have the
[00:10:09] outcome but they didn't have the skills
[00:10:12] the habits the perspectives the
[00:10:13] attributes necessary to keep or grow
[00:10:16] that wealth and a better wish would be
[00:10:19] give me the skills and attributes and
[00:10:21] habits that will let me make a million
[00:10:25] dollar and this is what we're doing with
[00:10:26] step number two is that we're looking at
[00:10:28] the med medium-term goal that you have
[00:10:30] and you can draw some inspiration from
[00:10:31] your long-term 5 to 10 year one as well
[00:10:34] and we're going to create what I call a
[00:10:36] meta goal and the Met goal is the
[00:10:41] person for whom it would be easy to
[00:10:45] achieve this goal if we think about the
[00:10:47] goal as an outcome and we realize that
[00:10:51] outcomes cannot be controlled outcomes
[00:10:54] are symptoms of the process that we
[00:10:58] control then what becomes important is
[00:11:01] the process and the person engaging in
[00:11:05] the process a person who's not capable
[00:11:08] of engaging in the process who's not
[00:11:10] capable of even knowing what the right
[00:11:11] process is is very unlikely to achieve
[00:11:14] the outcome aka the goal imagine someone
[00:11:17] who you think is like a complete genius
[00:11:21] and let's say your goal is to get a a
[00:11:23] great result in a certain exam this
[00:11:25] person is great time management never
[00:11:27] procrastinates focuses amazingly well
[00:11:30] the memory seems infallible now imagine
[00:11:32] that they failed this
[00:11:33] goal how surprised would you be it could
[00:11:37] happen you know something could happen
[00:11:39] like who knows but that would be
[00:11:41] shocking on the flip side think about
[00:11:44] someone who has terrible time management
[00:11:46] procrastinates all the time always gets
[00:11:47] distracted it's never studying the
[00:11:49] memory is full of holes they've never
[00:11:51] trained it they study skills all over
[00:11:52] the place they don't know what they're
[00:11:53] doing now imagine this person gets the
[00:11:55] top result in an
[00:11:57] exam that wild you wouldn't expect that
[00:12:01] so we can see already intuitively we
[00:12:04] understand that observing the process
[00:12:06] someone uses tells us How likely they
[00:12:08] are to achieve the outcome and this
[00:12:10] seems obvious but when a goal feels
[00:12:13] really important we become blind to this
[00:12:15] fact we start obsessing over the outcome
[00:12:18] and when we try to engage in the process
[00:12:21] we're so worried about the outcome that
[00:12:22] even the time we do spend is not spent
[00:12:25] effectively because we're so distracted
[00:12:27] and so while it is normal to worry about
[00:12:30] a goal that you really care about we
[00:12:33] need to channel that worry into
[00:12:36] something more productive which is to
[00:12:37] evaluate our processes evaluate our
[00:12:40] skills and think what can we control
[00:12:43] that will influence the outcome worrying
[00:12:45] about an outcome doesn't do anything for
[00:12:48] us and so with this meta goal we're
[00:12:51] thinking about who is the person that
[00:12:54] would find achieving this goal easy and
[00:12:58] then what are the
[00:13:01] skills and
[00:13:05] attributes and habits and also
[00:13:09] opportunities that this person has or
[00:13:11] has access to that allows this goal to
[00:13:14] be easy for them and you want to be
[00:13:17] detailed here you want to be specific
[00:13:20] think about time management skills task
[00:13:22] management and
[00:13:24] prioritization focus and concentration
[00:13:27] procrastination learn learning ability
[00:13:30] these are five core areas that I would
[00:13:32] recommend that you start thinking
[00:13:33] through to to begin with and by the way
[00:13:35] if you want to Fast Track Your
[00:13:37] Improvement in these five areas then you
[00:13:40] may want to check out my free Weekly
[00:13:42] Newsletter I basically took my 13 years
[00:13:44] of coaching experience pulled out what I
[00:13:46] thought were the most important nuggets
[00:13:48] of information and I put them into these
[00:13:50] free weekly newsletters they only take a
[00:13:52] few minutes to read but aim to save you
[00:13:55] 10 plus hours a week if you want to join
[00:13:57] there's a link for you in the
[00:13:58] description below and now let's get back
[00:14:01] to the idea of setting our meta goal and
[00:14:03] so this meta goal becomes our primary
[00:14:07] number one goal our number one priority
[00:14:10] is to become that person who would find
[00:14:14] achieving the goal much easier than who
[00:14:18] we are right now step three of reverse
[00:14:20] goal setting is to Define your current
[00:14:24] self so we know who we need to become so
[00:14:27] where are we now in relation to that
[00:14:30] what we do is for each of the skills and
[00:14:32] attributes and the habits and
[00:14:33] opportunities that we have identified so
[00:14:35] far we can rate the requirement for it
[00:14:39] out of 10 so let's say that if you want
[00:14:42] to do really well in a certain exam you
[00:14:44] think that your learning ability needs
[00:14:45] to be a N9 out of 10 your time
[00:14:47] management needs to be a a seven out of
[00:14:49] 10 let's say for example that's your
[00:14:52] goal so where are you right now right
[00:14:55] now maybe you are only a three out of 10
[00:14:59] 10 for both of these
[00:15:00] things then the Gap you have to fill
[00:15:05] becomes your plan and when you do step
[00:15:06] two and step three the same thing as
[00:15:08] before in step one can happen which is
[00:15:10] that you may arrive at the answer of I
[00:15:14] don't
[00:15:14] know and again this is very important to
[00:15:18] recognize if you don't even know what
[00:15:22] the skills and the attributes and the
[00:15:24] habits and the processes are that will
[00:15:26] lead to you being successful at your
[00:15:29] goal that's a problem because now you're
[00:15:31] relying on luck to get you there if we
[00:15:35] don't know that becomes the easiest plan
[00:15:38] of all because again step one becomes
[00:15:42] how can you know talk to people learn
[00:15:45] about things do some reading watch some
[00:15:48] videos understand what the requirements
[00:15:51] are not of the goal but of the person
[00:15:55] likewise if you're trying to evaluate
[00:15:56] your current ability and you don't know
[00:16:00] that's a problem it means that you don't
[00:16:02] have that self-awareness and that's
[00:16:04] nothing to be embarrassed about most
[00:16:06] people have absolutely no self-awareness
[00:16:08] until you start directing your attention
[00:16:11] at it and I can promise you you probably
[00:16:13] did not have less self-awareness than I
[00:16:17] did when I first started out so if
[00:16:18] you're looking at your current learning
[00:16:20] ability and you're like I actually have
[00:16:21] no idea what my learn I don't even know
[00:16:22] how to rank I don't even know how to
[00:16:24] think about that scoring it out of 10
[00:16:26] that's your first step you have to know
[00:16:28] know where your current ability is and
[00:16:31] actually during that process of figuring
[00:16:33] it out it's going to give you a lot of
[00:16:34] very targeted ways to improve it and as
[00:16:37] you improve on each of those ways you
[00:16:39] get closer and closer to becoming the
[00:16:41] person who can reach the goal and
[00:16:43] therefore you become closer to your goal
[00:16:44] the most underrated activity that you
[00:16:46] can do to begin with is to observe and
[00:16:49] reflect observe yourself be objective be
[00:16:53] honest what do you do what type of
[00:16:56] person do you see yourself as reflect on
[00:16:58] it and once you know where your current
[00:17:01] status is you see that gap for what it
[00:17:03] is I was talking to one of my previous
[00:17:05] employees the other day uh and she has
[00:17:08] ADHD she's a very high functioning super
[00:17:11] intelligent person but has always
[00:17:13] struggled with just sitting down and
[00:17:14] getting through a lot of work she's in a
[00:17:17] in a like a really good position at a
[00:17:19] new company she's got lots of pressure
[00:17:21] going on and so she's feeling the
[00:17:23] struggle like there's so much work she
[00:17:25] has to do but she struggles with sitting
[00:17:26] down and really being focused and
[00:17:28] concentrated
[00:17:29] and she's talking about all of these
[00:17:31] different things that she's sort of
[00:17:33] struggling with and trying to do and
[00:17:35] she's running into that problem she's
[00:17:37] setting a goal to try to study this many
[00:17:39] hours to work this many hours to
[00:17:40] dedicate that much time and it's failing
[00:17:42] every single day why is she failing
[00:17:44] because she's not actually addressing
[00:17:45] the underlying root cause for it which
[00:17:48] is her ability to stay focused and to
[00:17:50] not get distracted and for her I had
[00:17:52] already told her long ago the things she
[00:17:54] can do to improve concentration and just
[00:17:57] to train that ability take it from from
[00:17:58] a 3 out of 10 to a 5 out of 10 and it
[00:18:02] had never been a priority for her
[00:18:04] because it wasn't getting more work done
[00:18:06] and so you can see the Paradox she's so
[00:18:08] obsessed about achieving the goal and so
[00:18:11] motivated to get that work done but
[00:18:13] doesn't realize that the real Gap is
[00:18:15] that the person she is right now is not
[00:18:19] someone who will find it easy to achieve
[00:18:22] that goal and so the best step is to
[00:18:25] work on these things that get you closer
[00:18:27] to the person you need to be and now you
[00:18:30] don't need all of these other things to
[00:18:32] help you because it's just easier so
[00:18:35] once we've defined our current self we
[00:18:37] move on to step four which is to do a
[00:18:39] force field
[00:18:41] analysis a force field analysis is a
[00:18:45] technique where you take your current
[00:18:47] self which we've just defined we look at
[00:18:49] our goal which is our meta goal the
[00:18:51] future self we want to
[00:18:53] become uh and on a piece of paper you
[00:18:55] draw it like this with a this arcing
[00:18:58] line in between on one side of this are
[00:19:01] barriers and obstacles what are the
[00:19:03] things that prevent you from being able
[00:19:06] to achieve your meta goal on the other
[00:19:09] side of this line we have drivers what
[00:19:12] are the things that help us to succeed
[00:19:15] can push that through these may be our
[00:19:17] existing skills and habits and
[00:19:19] attributes and we also write what is our
[00:19:22] Network and resources to help us achieve
[00:19:26] this and so we're actually mapping out
[00:19:29] what are the things that we can employ
[00:19:32] to overcome these barriers and what are
[00:19:35] the things we have access to that can
[00:19:37] help us overcome these barriers to
[00:19:38] eventually move us along and achieve
[00:19:41] this goal this is a powerful exercise
[00:19:42] that I recommend that you do every few
[00:19:44] months anytime you feel like you're not
[00:19:46] sure exactly how to keep progressing and
[00:19:48] this technique is called a force field
[00:19:49] analysis because we're examining the
[00:19:51] forces that are keeping you from or
[00:19:54] pushing you towards your goal so if I
[00:19:56] use my example who was the person that I
[00:19:59] needed to be in order to achieve my goal
[00:20:02] of leaving medicine and going full-time
[00:20:04] into entrepreneurship and and education
[00:20:07] I realized that my time management would
[00:20:09] have to be really really good my
[00:20:10] prioritization skills would have to be
[00:20:12] really really good I would have to have
[00:20:14] access to Opportunities relating to
[00:20:16] business and certain experiences to make
[00:20:18] that transition easier and I realized
[00:20:20] that my current self was lacking in some
[00:20:23] of those areas my time management skills
[00:20:25] were pretty good but my prioritization
[00:20:26] skills weren't so good I had some
[00:20:29] experiences in business and I've been
[00:20:30] doing a lot of learning coaching already
[00:20:32] but I'd never really stepped fully into
[00:20:34] the role of Entrepreneurship I lacked a
[00:20:37] lot of those experiences and
[00:20:38] opportunities that would make that
[00:20:40] transition easy for me later when I did
[00:20:42] my force field analysis I realized that
[00:20:45] I have a lot of people within my network
[00:20:47] I have access to a lot of these
[00:20:49] resources that can enable me to do this
[00:20:51] and so for around 9 to 10 months I
[00:20:55] started dabbling a little bit more and
[00:20:57] gaining some of the those experiences in
[00:21:00] business one of the things that sounds
[00:21:02] kind of funny for someone that was
[00:21:04] wanting to do entrepreneurship full-time
[00:21:05] is that even though I've been running a
[00:21:08] education and learning coaching business
[00:21:10] for six and a half years at that point I
[00:21:15] had never really paid myself from it
[00:21:18] because most of it was actually done
[00:21:19] through a nonprofit like I'd set up a
[00:21:21] charity for education and so I'd never
[00:21:24] actually paid myself a salary um and so
[00:21:27] in the last couple of years I started
[00:21:30] actually just paying myself a salary and
[00:21:33] then seeing if I could manage the
[00:21:34] finances of my business when I was
[00:21:37] paying myself a living wage and so this
[00:21:39] process what I'm explaining of how I
[00:21:41] used my insights from this process to
[00:21:44] create my plan is step five building
[00:21:48] your plan in this final step we know
[00:21:51] where we need to get to we have our goal
[00:21:53] we have our meta goal we know where we
[00:21:56] currently stand and we know the things
[00:21:57] that can push and pull us towards that
[00:22:00] goal now all that's left is to figure
[00:22:02] out what to start focusing on first as a
[00:22:07] priority when to start doing
[00:22:10] it and how if you realize a thing that's
[00:22:14] lagging behind the most that you think
[00:22:15] is going to take the longest time for
[00:22:17] you to fix is your learning skills then
[00:22:20] that becomes the what to focus on when
[00:22:23] let's say immediately is the best time
[00:22:26] to start working on it and then how
[00:22:29] you figure that out if you don't know
[00:22:31] how again that becomes an obvious next
[00:22:34] step learn about how you know you need
[00:22:37] to work on it you know it's important
[00:22:39] you know it's a priority just because
[00:22:41] you don't know how to do it doesn't
[00:22:44] change the fact that it needs to be
[00:22:45] worked on sometimes the what when and
[00:22:48] how is not what you expect I worked with
[00:22:49] a student a number of years ago who was
[00:22:52] struggling at University and she had
[00:22:54] lots of things to work on in her
[00:22:56] learning skills No Doubt the gap between
[00:22:59] where she needed to get and her current
[00:23:00] self was wide and it was going to be a
[00:23:03] high priority for her to fill that Gap
[00:23:05] and so we tried to fill that Gap and
[00:23:07] then after trying for a few weeks I
[00:23:09] realized that she's not very consistent
[00:23:13] or diligent I realized that I'm setting
[00:23:16] her TSS and saying hey this is what you
[00:23:18] need to do to train your skills and then
[00:23:20] a week later she'd come back and have
[00:23:22] practiced almost none of it she was
[00:23:25] stagnant after digging a little bit
[00:23:27] deeper and having some more
[00:23:29] conversations I realized that she's
[00:23:31] actually being terribly abused at home
[00:23:33] by her parents that home environment was
[00:23:38] toxic and so the priorities changed you
[00:23:41] can't work on learning skills when you
[00:23:43] don't have that Foundation of stability
[00:23:45] and safety and so we actually changed
[00:23:47] the plan completely the number one
[00:23:48] priority became how can we support her
[00:23:52] and get her out of the house what was
[00:23:54] the barrier to that she didn't have a
[00:23:55] job so we figured out what kind of job
[00:23:58] can we get her to just make enough money
[00:24:02] to move out of the house because the
[00:24:03] time spent working a part-time
[00:24:06] job yes it takes away from study but in
[00:24:09] the grand scheme of things it makes so
[00:24:12] many other things easier that that was
[00:24:14] going to be the the the bottleneck that
[00:24:16] we had to solve a month later she moved
[00:24:19] out got a job moved out found a place to
[00:24:21] Flat it wasn't the nicest place but that
[00:24:24] was a life-changing move for her and
[00:24:26] when she had a little bit more mental
[00:24:27] space to think about that learning skill
[00:24:30] stuff again we jumped on that train
[00:24:31] again couple years later she was
[00:24:34] thriving she was doing a masters of
[00:24:35] Health Science and it was a challenging
[00:24:38] Road for her but she was able to make it
[00:24:42] through that because of understanding
[00:24:45] what to focus on when to focus on it how
[00:24:47] to focus on it and being flexible
[00:24:50] understanding that the thing you think
[00:24:52] you may need to do to achieve your goal
[00:24:55] may not be if you just take a step back
[00:24:57] and evaluate situation holistically in a
[00:25:00] less extreme example one thing that I
[00:25:01] see very very commonly is that people
[00:25:03] think that they need to improve their
[00:25:04] learning skills but actually the thing
[00:25:06] that holds them back the most is
[00:25:07] actually the fact that they
[00:25:08] procrastinate all the time or they're
[00:25:10] not willing to try something new so you
[00:25:11] can see that is actually a fundamental
[00:25:13] blocker and in this final step where
[00:25:15] we're building the plan that will become
[00:25:17] the what working on our experimentation
[00:25:20] ability working on our procrastination
[00:25:22] and this stuff is what enters into your
[00:25:26] calendar at the end of the day every day
[00:25:29] there is something that you know is a
[00:25:30] high priority for you to develop your
[00:25:32] skills and your attributes and your
[00:25:33] processes and your habits uh and your
[00:25:35] access to Opportunities and resources
[00:25:39] that you know gets you towards your goal
[00:25:41] and you schedule that into your day into
[00:25:42] your evenings into your weekends that
[00:25:45] becomes your plan and as you grow as a
[00:25:48] person the outcomes you naturally are
[00:25:50] able to achieve grow with it now there
[00:25:53] is one thing that I have to mention
[00:25:55] which is that changing your skills and
[00:25:57] your habits B is not a quick or easy
[00:26:01] thing it takes time it takes diligence
[00:26:04] it probably takes you longer than you
[00:26:06] expect it to and the more things you try
[00:26:08] to improve at the same time the harder
[00:26:10] it gets to improve any of them so when
[00:26:12] you are plotting your timeline make sure
[00:26:15] it's a realistic
[00:26:17] timeline be conservative with how long
[00:26:19] you think it would take to develop and
[00:26:21] grow your skills especially if they're
[00:26:23] habits that you have had for years it's
[00:26:27] going to take a little bit of time to
[00:26:28] change that for me transitioning away
[00:26:30] from medicine during that period of time
[00:26:32] I would only focus on one maybe two
[00:26:35] things on any given month and even
[00:26:37] though I knew there were 10 other things
[00:26:38] to work on I deliberately stopped myself
[00:26:40] from working on it to make sure I gave
[00:26:42] myself the best chance of success and
[00:26:45] after that roughly a year 10 9 10 months
[00:26:49] I was able to transition out of medicine
[00:26:51] relatively smoothly and the thing is all
[00:26:55] these like all my friends people that I
[00:26:57] went to UNI with started messaging me
[00:26:58] saying hey Justin how did you do that
[00:27:00] like I've also been thinking about
[00:27:02] quitting being a doctor or quitting
[00:27:04] being a pharmacist you're so this is
[00:27:06] what they said is that they said you're
[00:27:08] so lucky that you had that business to
[00:27:11] fall back
[00:27:13] on and if that's what luck is
[00:27:17] then it seems to be a lot more
[00:27:19] controllable than you think so this is
[00:27:22] reverse goal sitting and if you've never
[00:27:23] set goals like this before then it's
[00:27:24] very different but if you have struggled
[00:27:27] with noral goal setting before then you
[00:27:30] owe it to yourself to at least give this
[00:27:32] a chance and I will say this I now
[00:27:36] almost never use normal goal setting for
[00:27:38] anything anymore if it's important and
[00:27:42] complicated enough for me to go through
[00:27:44] and set a goal I use reverse goal
[00:27:47] setting I hope this helps thanks for
[00:27:49] watching and I'll see you next time


=== 63 Minutes of Brutally Honest Study Advice ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goHaIfMcfWo

[00:00:00] I've been a learning coach for the past
[00:00:01] 13 years in that time I've easily
[00:00:04] studied well over 10,000 hours I've
[00:00:07] studied medicine learning science uh
[00:00:10] Computing and AI education marketing
[00:00:13] business accounting all sorts of things
[00:00:15] and in the first 5 to six years of
[00:00:18] studying I probably wasted about 80% of
[00:00:21] my time I've made a lot of mistakes but
[00:00:25] I have learned from them so in this
[00:00:27] video I'm going to compress 10,000 hours
[00:00:30] of studying into 15 important lessons
[00:00:33] that every student and learner of any
[00:00:35] age should know lesson number one cram
[00:00:39] early there's this really logical piece
[00:00:43] of advice that one of my seniors gave to
[00:00:46] me when I was first entering into
[00:00:48] University and honestly this is probably
[00:00:50] the only reason I was able to make it
[00:00:53] through that year even though my Pro
[00:00:55] sisters were so inefficient he said if
[00:00:58] you are the type of person that crams
[00:01:01] before an exam and that works for you
[00:01:04] and you can cram and do decently before
[00:01:07] an exam and that was me you during a lot
[00:01:10] of high
[00:01:11] school then just do the same thing just
[00:01:15] cram but do it at the very beginning
[00:01:19] don't wait until before the exam just
[00:01:22] cram the whole paper at the very very
[00:01:25] beginning and now you have an additional
[00:01:26] 2 three months where you can spend your
[00:01:28] time finding gaps for filling gaps and
[00:01:30] just getting to that next level of
[00:01:31] confidence and the reason I give this
[00:01:33] advice to you is that not every
[00:01:35] situation requires you to have
[00:01:38] consistent diligence of studying for the
[00:01:42] entire year and the worst case scenario
[00:01:44] is really you leave it to the last
[00:01:46] minute to cram and then you realize it's
[00:01:48] not enough and then now you're screwed
[00:01:50] so if you feel like you can go faster
[00:01:54] than the cohort and you feel like you
[00:01:56] can finish things faster just do it like
[00:01:59] get through through that stuff as
[00:02:00] quickly as you want to some of my uni
[00:02:02] students are actually doing that like
[00:02:03] they're finishing their entire Year's
[00:02:05] curriculum even for like medical
[00:02:07] students with huge curriculums they're
[00:02:08] finishing in April May and then they're
[00:02:11] spending the rest of the year just
[00:02:13] literally two three hours a week on just
[00:02:15] topping up their memory looking for gaps
[00:02:17] adding a few bits here and there like
[00:02:19] it's such a relaxing experience of
[00:02:22] University very different to how I went
[00:02:24] through uni listen number two don't
[00:02:27] create learning debt I think this is
[00:02:30] probably one of the most important
[00:02:32] Concepts that I've picked up over the
[00:02:34] years when I was in my first year of
[00:02:36] University trying to enter into medical
[00:02:37] school and studying like absolute
[00:02:40] crazy 17 18 19 20 hours a day barely
[00:02:44] sleeping at all a lot of my time was
[00:02:47] spent on what I now realize as creating
[00:02:51] learning debt here's what I'd do I would
[00:02:53] go to the
[00:02:54] lecture during the lecture I'd take a
[00:02:57] bunch of notes then I'd go and and then
[00:02:59] I'd review my notes and while I'm
[00:03:03] reviewing it and and reading from the
[00:03:06] textbook I would then go and make a
[00:03:09] bunch of flash
[00:03:11] cards in this process of going through
[00:03:14] the textbook making flash cards
[00:03:16] rereading the notes going through the
[00:03:17] lecture slides would take me somewhere
[00:03:19] along the lines of roughly 2 hours per
[00:03:22] lecture and I was trying to be pretty
[00:03:24] comprehensive and so with three or four
[00:03:26] lectures a day this time would
[00:03:28] accumulate two around 6 to 8 hours per
[00:03:32] day on reviewing making flash cards
[00:03:35] reading through the textbook and at the
[00:03:36] time I thought this is time well spent
[00:03:39] because I'm doing a lot of good studying
[00:03:41] but as I said before I was studying way
[00:03:43] more than 8 hours a day if I was
[00:03:45] studying 8 hours a day I think I would
[00:03:47] have been really happy I was studying
[00:03:49] double that amount of time so what was I
[00:03:51] doing in the extra 6789 10 hours a day I
[00:03:56] was reviewing the stuff that I studied
[00:03:58] in the previous day and the week before
[00:04:00] that so after I create let's say flash
[00:04:02] cards for 3 4 hours I then spend another
[00:04:06] 3 or 4 hours to go over my flashcards
[00:04:09] and this is what I mean by learning debt
[00:04:12] when you're studying the primary focus
[00:04:15] is to take that information store it in
[00:04:18] your memory and then be able to use that
[00:04:20] information in the level and way that
[00:04:22] you need to use it for your assessment
[00:04:24] or using it at work whatever you need to
[00:04:26] learn it for so time that does not
[00:04:29] contribute rute to that is a waste of
[00:04:32] time if I spend 2 hours making flash
[00:04:34] cards the time spent on making flash
[00:04:37] cards only creates learning in my brain
[00:04:40] when I then spend time later to go over
[00:04:43] them there's very very little learning
[00:04:46] generated from just making the flash
[00:04:49] cards in the first place and so what I'm
[00:04:51] doing is I'm actually taking the
[00:04:53] learning I need to do today and I'm
[00:04:55] offloading that to a future version of
[00:04:58] myself I'm saying hey
[00:05:00] you you need to learn this and you're
[00:05:02] giving yourself a task to deal with
[00:05:06] later that is debt you have created for
[00:05:09] your future self and so here's the
[00:05:10] problem with learning debt is that debt
[00:05:13] does not scale this becomes really
[00:05:15] obvious if I do a little bit of Maths
[00:05:17] for you so let's say if we use my
[00:05:19] example I'm spending 2 hours and in this
[00:05:22] two hours what what am I doing I'm
[00:05:24] creating a bunch of flash
[00:05:25] cards and I'm also writing a bunch of
[00:05:28] notes by by the time I finished this 2
[00:05:31] hours I can tell you I can promise you I
[00:05:33] didn't have a great level of knowledge
[00:05:35] and if I tested myself on this a week
[00:05:37] later my retention would be 50% if I'm
[00:05:40] lucky so now this has become debt and so
[00:05:43] the next day I now need to spend let's
[00:05:46] say another hour to go over my notes and
[00:05:50] to do my
[00:05:51] flashcards so now that's an hour of debt
[00:05:55] I've given myself but remember tomorrow
[00:05:57] I need to do the same thing so I'm also
[00:05:59] spending in 2 hours on this day creating
[00:06:02] a new set of flash cards and notes for
[00:06:05] the stuff I learned on that day and I'm
[00:06:06] creating another set of debt for myself
[00:06:10] where I might need to spend another hour
[00:06:11] going through that material but the debt
[00:06:14] accumulates so the thing that I did on
[00:06:16] the first day just by doing it the next
[00:06:19] day that debt hasn't cleared I still
[00:06:22] don't have the retention that I need
[00:06:24] from it so normally if we look at some
[00:06:27] research around space repetition and how
[00:06:29] long takes to really get that
[00:06:31] information solid depends on the type of
[00:06:33] information but it's usually between
[00:06:35] three to seven repetitions is necessary
[00:06:37] to get the retention that you need so I
[00:06:40] now need to do this again and again and
[00:06:43] again and so every day I'm actually
[00:06:45] building up more debt that I'm able to
[00:06:48] clear and that's why by the end of the
[00:06:51] semester I would get to a point where
[00:06:53] I've got 2,000 flash cards that I need
[00:06:56] to do and I'm spending four to 5 hours
[00:06:59] every every single day just clearing
[00:07:01] through flash cards that I made
[00:07:03] previously and barely hanging in there
[00:07:06] in terms of getting through my textbook
[00:07:07] readings going reviewing the lecture
[00:07:09] recordings and I'm already watching
[00:07:11] those lecture recordings at double or
[00:07:12] triple speed there's nothing more I can
[00:07:14] do because I've got so much learning
[00:07:16] debt I need to get through in order to
[00:07:19] have made that previous learning useful
[00:07:22] and until I go through and do those
[00:07:25] repetitions every single day I'm not
[00:07:27] extracting the value of learning from
[00:07:29] that previous time that I spent and one
[00:07:31] thing that I realized very clearly as
[00:07:32] soon as I entered into medical school
[00:07:34] was that there is a low ceiling of how
[00:07:38] effective this strategy can be at a
[00:07:40] certain point you just don't have enough
[00:07:43] time to do all of this repetition every
[00:07:46] single day you are just trapped in this
[00:07:48] Rat Race like this constant NeverEnding
[00:07:51] grind of doing flash cards at least
[00:07:54] that's what it felt for me for that
[00:07:55] first couple years of University and so
[00:07:57] if we fast forward and let's say I'm now
[00:08:01] in my fifth year of University I've
[00:08:02] learned a lot about how to study and
[00:08:05] what does my studying look like now to
[00:08:07] reduce the learning debt so what changed
[00:08:09] is that I might be spending the same 2
[00:08:12] hours up front or sometimes even longer
[00:08:16] but in the 2 hours I'm getting like 80
[00:08:18] to 90% of the learning that I need to
[00:08:21] get done first I'm not trying to give my
[00:08:26] future self anything to do my objective
[00:08:28] is to learn it really well have a really
[00:08:30] good retention a deep understanding
[00:08:32] really connect it all together in that
[00:08:35] session and there are a number of other
[00:08:36] other strategies that I often talk about
[00:08:38] that that help with that but it's never
[00:08:40] possible to make this 100% there is
[00:08:42] still going to be some stuff that you're
[00:08:44] not able to get done that you do need
[00:08:46] that repetition for that you do need to
[00:08:48] make those flash cards for because it is
[00:08:49] a valuable tool but it's only that 10 to
[00:08:52] 20% and so the amount of debt that I'm
[00:08:54] carrying forward into the next day is
[00:08:57] minimal and also because my knowledge is
[00:09:00] so much deeper the first time I learn it
[00:09:04] my retention is much stronger so I don't
[00:09:06] actually need to repeat and review this
[00:09:09] every single day to keep on top of it I
[00:09:11] can review it like once a week and my
[00:09:14] retention is still high enough that it's
[00:09:17] sustainable and so now I only need 15
[00:09:19] minutes every 2 or 3 days to clear
[00:09:23] through the debt that I've created for
[00:09:24] myself and that's very manageable so
[00:09:26] take a really honest look at the way
[00:09:28] that you're study
[00:09:29] and just ask yourself how much of the
[00:09:31] time you spend on studying is spent on
[00:09:34] things where you know you haven't really
[00:09:37] learned it by the end of that time and
[00:09:39] you're relying on your future self to do
[00:09:41] something to make that valuable if you
[00:09:45] are spending a lot of time doing that
[00:09:46] you're creating learning debt and I
[00:09:48] strongly believe that it's impossible to
[00:09:50] improve your learning efficiency until
[00:09:52] you address that it's lesson number
[00:09:54] three study more then study less if you
[00:09:58] were to ask me what is the number one
[00:10:01] thing that you can do to get better
[00:10:03] grades better performance the number one
[00:10:07] most important thing that you can do is
[00:10:10] just study more and this is different to
[00:10:13] the advice that I normally give but
[00:10:15] here's how it works in the early stages
[00:10:18] of this x-axis is the number of hours
[00:10:20] that you spend studying and then here
[00:10:22] you've got your
[00:10:24] performance if you're starting with not
[00:10:26] studying at all and then you go from not
[00:10:29] studying at all to just studying more
[00:10:32] your performance is going to increase a
[00:10:35] lot and so there's actually very large
[00:10:37] proportion of people who are just not
[00:10:40] putting in enough hours and not doing
[00:10:42] enough work to get the results now what
[00:10:44] happens eventually is that extra hours
[00:10:47] start contributing less to your
[00:10:48] performance so you get this thing called
[00:10:49] diminishing returns right so at a
[00:10:51] certain point every extra hour of
[00:10:54] studying that you're doing per day is
[00:10:56] only increasing your performance by like
[00:10:58] one or
[00:11:00] 0.5% and then you get to a point where
[00:11:03] actually it inverts so the more hours
[00:11:06] you do your performance starts declining
[00:11:08] and this is because you're dropping an
[00:11:09] efficiency you're burning yourself out
[00:11:12] and so the trajectory of becoming better
[00:11:14] at studying is to first of all get to a
[00:11:17] point where you feel like you are
[00:11:18] actually studying enough and I would say
[00:11:21] and this varies a lot but if it's a
[00:11:23] fairly competitive type of program that
[00:11:26] you're that you're studying in then
[00:11:28] somewhere along the line of 3 to 5 hours
[00:11:31] a day is probably very reasonable and
[00:11:34] beyond that you're definitely going to
[00:11:36] start getting diminishing returns and
[00:11:38] potentially even dropping into the
[00:11:40] negative so this is the study more part
[00:11:43] and then comes then study less this is
[00:11:46] the part that a lot of people Miss once
[00:11:48] you get to a point where you do think
[00:11:50] you are actually studying a reasonable
[00:11:51] amount your next focus is how do I then
[00:11:54] study less and the reason you switch
[00:11:56] focus is because the type of improve
[00:11:59] Improvement and gain that you make with
[00:12:00] your study skills changes from an effort
[00:12:04] gain to an efficiency gain if your
[00:12:07] solution to not getting the performance
[00:12:09] that you want is just to put in more
[00:12:11] hours then you're not getting
[00:12:13] improvements in your process or your
[00:12:15] efficiency you're just getting
[00:12:17] improvements in the effort that you're
[00:12:19] putting in which is fine when you're at
[00:12:22] low effort but if you are already at
[00:12:25] reasonable or high effort then getting
[00:12:27] more effort gains is not likely to lead
[00:12:30] to the performance that you want
[00:12:31] especially if there's a big gap between
[00:12:33] the performance that you want and the
[00:12:34] performance that you're consistently
[00:12:35] getting and so by actively trying to
[00:12:38] study less and at the same time improve
[00:12:42] your performance which I know sounds
[00:12:44] crazy and feels like a radical idea for
[00:12:46] some people by actively switching that
[00:12:48] focus it forces you to examine your
[00:12:50] process and think how can I make it more
[00:12:52] efficient remember that studying
[00:12:55] efficiently means being able to do more
[00:12:59] with less and if you are already on this
[00:13:03] path of increasing your
[00:13:05] efficiency then your next lesson is
[00:13:08] lesson number four study less then study
[00:13:12] more and I know that sounds like exactly
[00:13:14] the opposite of what I just said but
[00:13:17] here's how it goes once you are now at
[00:13:19] that point where you are already working
[00:13:22] hard and you're trying to improve your
[00:13:24] efficiency and you're thinking about how
[00:13:25] to study less the biggest barrier you'll
[00:13:28] face and the biggest barrier I faced to
[00:13:30] actually improving and figuring out how
[00:13:32] to be more efficient is that you just
[00:13:35] don't have enough time at the moment at
[00:13:37] that present situation you have a
[00:13:40] certain level of performance which will
[00:13:41] say p and you're achieving this by
[00:13:45] having a certain process which may not
[00:13:47] be that efficient so we'll use a smaller
[00:13:49] bar for this we'll make it red and we'll
[00:13:52] say that's P
[00:13:54] process combined with a certain amount
[00:13:57] of effort that you're putting in and at
[00:13:58] the moment you're putting in a
[00:13:59] reasonable amount of
[00:14:01] effort when we start trying to reduce
[00:14:04] this effort that process is not going to
[00:14:07] at the exact same time increase to
[00:14:10] become more efficient it's not that easy
[00:14:12] there's some trial and error and
[00:14:13] experimentation and mistakes you need to
[00:14:14] make to figure out how to learn more
[00:14:16] efficiently so when your effort drops
[00:14:18] your performance may actually drop at
[00:14:20] least a little bit and so what I'm
[00:14:21] saying is don't go from studying like 10
[00:14:24] hours a day to now studying 2 hours a
[00:14:26] day because your performance will
[00:14:28] plummet go from 10 hours a day to 9 and
[00:14:31] 1 half hours a day to 9 hours a day but
[00:14:33] expect that you may have a small
[00:14:36] decrease in your shortterm performance
[00:14:39] but you need the extra time you need the
[00:14:42] extra time that you free up from
[00:14:44] studying a little bit less to figure out
[00:14:47] how to study more efficiently you need
[00:14:50] time to reflect to think to learn about
[00:14:54] studying to watch this video to improve
[00:14:57] your process and so there's a common
[00:14:58] sense saying that everyone knows work
[00:15:01] smarter not harder but there's nothing
[00:15:03] wrong with working hard and so some
[00:15:06] people say work smarter and harder but
[00:15:09] as a coach from a practical perspective
[00:15:12] I think the most important one is work
[00:15:14] smarter then harder because when you
[00:15:18] work too hard you don't have time to
[00:15:21] figure out how to work
[00:15:23] smarter create time to work smarter once
[00:15:27] your process is more efficient you can
[00:15:29] reinvest those hours that you took out
[00:15:31] before you can increase your effort
[00:15:32] again if you really need to or you can
[00:15:34] use that extra time to sleep more touch
[00:15:38] some grass and just thinking about it
[00:15:40] now I think I probably could have made
[00:15:42] the same progress on improving my
[00:15:44] learning efficiency that took me two
[00:15:46] years of University in like six months
[00:15:50] if I had just understood this because I
[00:15:53] was so not willing to study less lesson
[00:15:56] number five plug the leak if you are in
[00:16:00] a boat and the boat is leaking and
[00:16:04] filling with water your number one
[00:16:07] priority is to plug the
[00:16:10] leak you don't spend your time bucketing
[00:16:14] water out from the boat because it's
[00:16:17] futile and the longer you wait to plug
[00:16:19] the leak the more water there is for you
[00:16:21] to Buck it out later even after the leak
[00:16:23] has been
[00:16:24] plugged this is exactly the same
[00:16:27] situation with studying I do a lot of
[00:16:29] work with students that are
[00:16:30] transitioning from the high school into
[00:16:32] University especially for competitive
[00:16:34] programs and one of the most common
[00:16:38] pieces of feedback that I hear from
[00:16:39] these students is that as soon as they
[00:16:41] enter into University it just feels like
[00:16:43] they're hit with the Sunami of work and
[00:16:47] uncertainty that they've never had to
[00:16:49] face before in high school and I felt
[00:16:51] that like full force when I entered into
[00:16:53] University I was like the volume and the
[00:16:56] workload and the the difficulty is so
[00:16:59] much higher than I expected and a lot of
[00:17:01] people aren't able to adapt to that and
[00:17:03] if it doesn't happen in University
[00:17:05] usually the next place that happens is
[00:17:07] in graduating and entering into the
[00:17:09] workforce and then they're hit again
[00:17:10] with that wave of responsibility and
[00:17:13] pressure that they didn't experience in
[00:17:14] University and across my years of seeing
[00:17:17] thousands of people that get hit in the
[00:17:20] face with the tsunami the successful
[00:17:22] Learners are the ones that plug the leak
[00:17:26] first let's say that there are two types
[00:17:27] of people the first type of person gets
[00:17:30] hit in the face with the tsunami huge
[00:17:32] workload realizes they're sign a fall
[00:17:35] behind retention isn't where it needs to
[00:17:36] be they're not on top of their knowledge
[00:17:39] and so they study more fine they study
[00:17:43] more and they realize they are still
[00:17:45] falling behind and they're still feeling
[00:17:47] like they're constantly playing catchup
[00:17:49] and so they respond to this by studying
[00:17:51] even more and even more and even more
[00:17:54] until they get to a point where they are
[00:17:55] spending their entire time studying uh
[00:17:58] and they're not doing anything anything
[00:17:59] else other than studying just to be able
[00:18:01] to feel like they are not drowning okay
[00:18:03] if you haven't guessed already that this
[00:18:05] person is what I did then you have the
[00:18:07] second type of person which is they have
[00:18:10] the same initial experience they're
[00:18:12] overwhelmed they feel like they're
[00:18:13] falling behind and initially they just
[00:18:15] try to study a little bit more but then
[00:18:17] they realize that that isn't enough and
[00:18:19] they realize that the issue here is that
[00:18:21] there is a leak the process that they
[00:18:24] are using is not enough to keep up with
[00:18:27] the pace they really realiz that even
[00:18:29] though they're falling behind just a
[00:18:31] little bit right now and they're only
[00:18:33] two or three lectures behind if they're
[00:18:36] fallen behind now if they wait three or
[00:18:39] four more weeks they're now going to be
[00:18:41] 20 lectures behind and so they realize
[00:18:44] that and spend their time to improve
[00:18:47] their process rapidly so that they are
[00:18:51] at least not falling behind anymore and
[00:18:54] there's still three lectures behind but
[00:18:56] every single day that passes it's not
[00:18:58] adding more lectures to the backlog it's
[00:19:01] not letting water continue into the boat
[00:19:04] at the end of the day these two students
[00:19:05] are going to be in very different
[00:19:07] situations one student is going to be
[00:19:09] burnt out studying like crazy with a lot
[00:19:12] of stuff that they've fallen behind on
[00:19:14] that they need to catch up with the
[00:19:16] other student will also have worked very
[00:19:17] very hard but they're in a position now
[00:19:21] that they're not falling behind anymore
[00:19:23] and they can spend the additional time
[00:19:25] that they have on catching up on the
[00:19:27] things that they did for behind on
[00:19:29] before who do you think will have the
[00:19:31] better outcome and so here's like a very
[00:19:34] quick tip for you if you are if you feel
[00:19:36] like you're this first person you have a
[00:19:38] choice you can make with the time that
[00:19:39] you spend do I prepare for what I'm
[00:19:43] about to learn or do I review the stuff
[00:19:47] that I've fallen behind on if you can
[00:19:50] only do one of the two prepare for what
[00:19:53] you're about to learn there are certain
[00:19:56] strategies where you don't even need to
[00:19:58] be that good at them for it to be
[00:20:01] beneficial one of those things is just
[00:20:03] doing a very very quick pre-study if
[00:20:06] you've got a one hour lecture coming up
[00:20:08] spend 15 minutes pre- studying on just
[00:20:11] what you think are the most difficult
[00:20:12] and important part of what you're about
[00:20:14] to learn that may be enough to help you
[00:20:17] stay on top of what you are currently
[00:20:20] learning that may be enough to help you
[00:20:22] plug the leak it's not a crazy technique
[00:20:24] you need to spend weeks or months
[00:20:25] learning how to do it could be about
[00:20:27] deciding to spend that extra 20 30
[00:20:31] minutes on this lecture to make sure
[00:20:33] you've really got it down to maybe add a
[00:20:36] little bit more uh time and effort on
[00:20:38] critically thinking about the
[00:20:39] information to process it a little bit
[00:20:41] more deeply to make your memory stronger
[00:20:44] right now when you learn it and not
[00:20:46] create that learning debt that may be
[00:20:49] the thing that helps you to plug that
[00:20:51] leak or at least make that leak smaller
[00:20:54] and yes you will still be behind on
[00:20:56] everything that you're behind right now
[00:20:57] but the real problem is not the fact
[00:21:00] that you have fallen behind it's that
[00:21:04] you are falling behind it's still
[00:21:08] happening and the longer you leave it
[00:21:11] the further behind you fall plug the
[00:21:13] leak then clear the backlog by the way
[00:21:16] if you're finding these tips helpful and
[00:21:17] you want even more then you may want to

[00:21:23] is where I cover even more study tips

[00:21:38] piece of study advice lesson number six
[00:21:41] make learning hard effective learning is
[00:21:46] not easy effective learning doesn't feel
[00:21:51] fast at least not at first anytime you
[00:21:54] learn something that learning happens
[00:21:56] inside our brain okay let's this is the
[00:21:58] brain
[00:22:01] information comes into our brain our
[00:22:03] brain does stuff with that information
[00:22:06] it thinks about it and then depending on
[00:22:08] how it thinks about it and processes
[00:22:10] that information it outputs it as a
[00:22:13] memory and we broadly call this process
[00:22:16] encoding you encoding information into
[00:22:19] your memory and you need to do this if
[00:22:21] you want to have that knowledge to be
[00:22:23] able to use it and retrieve it for your
[00:22:26] applications like an exam and for most
[00:22:28] people people this middle part what
[00:22:31] happens in the brain is the major
[00:22:33] limiter this is the major constraint
[00:22:35] this is your bottleneck and so if you're
[00:22:37] having trouble with your retention and
[00:22:39] the quality of your memory and you feel
[00:22:41] like you're forgetting things very
[00:22:42] quickly or if you feel like no matter
[00:22:44] how hard you study there are always
[00:22:46] these really difficult complicated
[00:22:48] questions that you can never seem to
[00:22:49] answer that's because of what's
[00:22:52] happening in the step before inside your
[00:22:54] brain the way that your brain is
[00:22:55] processing it is not compatible with
[00:22:58] producing high quality memory or a deep
[00:23:00] level of understanding and so it doesn't
[00:23:02] matter how fast or efficiently
[00:23:05] information comes into the brain and it
[00:23:08] doesn't matter how much you repeat
[00:23:10] things in your memory of things that you
[00:23:13] previously learned the major problem is
[00:23:16] that what's happening in the brain in
[00:23:18] the first place is not effective so when
[00:23:20] I was struggling with learning what did
[00:23:22] I do I watched my lectures double Speed
[00:23:26] Triple speed to try to get that
[00:23:28] information coming through faster I did
[00:23:30] more flash cards I did more repetitions
[00:23:34] I took my cruddy memory which was
[00:23:36] failing me every single day and I just
[00:23:38] Tred to brute force it through
[00:23:40] repetition to be better I spent all my
[00:23:43] time here and here without realizing
[00:23:46] that the problem was here in the middle
[00:23:48] and the thing is that effective learning
[00:23:52] Active Learning takes mental effort your
[00:23:56] brain needs to think deep deeply about
[00:23:59] what you're learning it needs to
[00:24:01] evaluate it it needs to compare it
[00:24:04] against what it already knows and
[00:24:05] compare it with what you're learning it
[00:24:07] needs to look for actively look for
[00:24:11] patterns and that process is the thing
[00:24:15] that creates effective learning and so
[00:24:17] if your goalpost is like what mine was
[00:24:21] where you think that getting better at
[00:24:23] learning means that learning is faster
[00:24:26] and easier you're actually going to
[00:24:29] start making changes to your learning
[00:24:31] strategies that make your results worse
[00:24:34] it's like cool I've now got this AI
[00:24:36] That's going to record the lecture turn
[00:24:38] it into a transcript and automatically
[00:24:40] create a bunch of flashcards for me is
[00:24:43] that saving me time yes could that be
[00:24:46] beneficial definitely is that going to
[00:24:48] solve the fundamental issue no because
[00:24:51] at the end of the day my brain hasn't
[00:24:53] been involved in that process in one way
[00:24:55] or another I have to insert my brain
[00:24:57] into that process to do the heavy
[00:24:59] lifting and to do that deep thinking I
[00:25:01] have these very clear memories of when I
[00:25:03] was in high school and I thought you
[00:25:06] know what I I don't know why like one
[00:25:07] day I just decided like I'm going to try
[00:25:09] to be like a diligent student and so I
[00:25:12] would every day after school go to the
[00:25:14] University Library study with all the
[00:25:16] uni kids um and I would find a position
[00:25:20] and I and I would think like ah this is
[00:25:21] the perfect position for me like I had
[00:25:23] my specific desk and if someone was
[00:25:25] sitting there I had like another place
[00:25:26] and I would go there and I get all my
[00:25:28] books out and then I would just like
[00:25:30] study till 10 p.m. and I remember very
[00:25:33] clearly most of that time I was there I
[00:25:37] was either distracted falling asleep or
[00:25:41] actually asleep the process of studying
[00:25:44] could be described as tedious uh drowsy
[00:25:49] monotonous boring if I was studying a
[00:25:52] subject that I just happen to really
[00:25:54] enjoy for me that subject was like
[00:25:56] Classics I really like classical studies
[00:25:58] I would be engaged I'd be interested I'd
[00:26:00] feel curious and my learning would feel
[00:26:02] more effective and at the time I would
[00:26:03] just chalk it up to being like this is a
[00:26:05] subject I happen to be better at that is
[00:26:09] wrong that is a subject where for
[00:26:10] whatever reason I was using a more
[00:26:13] involved active learning strategy and my
[00:26:15] brain was spending more effort but
[00:26:18] because that effort was productive my
[00:26:20] brain enjoyed it whereas ironically when
[00:26:23] I was passive and my brain was asleep
[00:26:25] and I was just trying to Ram information
[00:26:27] down Drew repetition into my brain it
[00:26:30] was not engaged it was not interested it
[00:26:33] was not actively being used I wasn't
[00:26:34] thinking critically or deeply about what
[00:26:36] I was learning and I was actually
[00:26:39] getting more tired and drowsy and sleepy
[00:26:41] because of it because I was getting
[00:26:43] bored out so if you want to get better
[00:26:45] at learning don't try to make Learning
[00:26:47] Easy make learning harder look for ways
[00:26:52] to think more look at where you're
[00:26:54] learning and when you're studying and
[00:26:57] pay attention to to when you feel like
[00:26:59] your brain is actively involved in
[00:27:01] thinking dissecting putting the
[00:27:03] information together it should feel if
[00:27:06] you're studying effectively like the
[00:27:09] information are pieces of a jigsaw
[00:27:11] puzzle that you're looking at together
[00:27:13] to see how it fits into a big picture
[00:27:16] that is a very very accurate
[00:27:18] representation of what effective
[00:27:19] learning should feel like for almost any
[00:27:21] subject for the rest of your life I can
[00:27:24] promise that and if it doesn't feel like
[00:27:27] that see how you can make it feel like
[00:27:29] that it will take more effort but that's
[00:27:32] a good thing lesson number seven make
[00:27:34] the hard stuff easy so when I was in the
[00:27:38] middle of my third year of University
[00:27:40] when I was starting to realize a lot of
[00:27:43] these things and I had started figuring
[00:27:46] out a lot more about how to study
[00:27:48] effectively one of the things I realized
[00:27:50] was that my hard learning the active
[00:27:54] high quality stuff was also so energy
[00:27:57] consuming
[00:27:58] and it was so exhausting to do that I
[00:28:02] started feeling daunted by sitting down
[00:28:05] to study because I just knew how hard I
[00:28:07] would have to think about it and if I am
[00:28:09] studying and I don't feel like I'm
[00:28:11] really putting all of that effort and I
[00:28:12] feel disappointed in myself like it's
[00:28:14] not effective and I just wasted my time
[00:28:16] and so what I realized is that there are
[00:28:18] actually ways of still doing that
[00:28:22] difficult effortful high quality
[00:28:25] learning but making it feel a lot less
[00:28:28] overwhelming and easy to just get into
[00:28:30] and the trick here is something called
[00:28:32] layering and
[00:28:35] Scaffolding layering and Scaffolding our
[00:28:38] learning means that we approach the
[00:28:41] information in these rungs of difficulty
[00:28:44] and this is what makes hard Learning
[00:28:47] Easy so let's say that I have this book
[00:28:49] that I'm reading here which is
[00:28:51] contemporary theories of learning which
[00:28:53] is by the way a great book but can be
[00:28:56] pretty dense to read now if I'm learning
[00:28:59] from this
[00:29:00] book and I'm trying to learn as much as
[00:29:04] I can from every single chapter and get
[00:29:06] the full level of detail and retain 90%
[00:29:10] of that to the point where I like I've
[00:29:12] mastered everything in this book that is
[00:29:15] a big task and that is very challenging
[00:29:17] to be able to pull off like in a single
[00:29:20] study session so layering and
[00:29:23] Scaffolding that approach means that I
[00:29:25] set my goal post a little bit easier
[00:29:28] so instead of trying to get to that
[00:29:31] level for everything I get to that level
[00:29:36] so still doing that high quality
[00:29:37] thinking still doing all of that deep
[00:29:41] evaluation but I do that just for the
[00:29:44] parts of the information that I feel are
[00:29:47] easier for me to start with and
[00:29:49] understand and put together I pick out
[00:29:51] the key ideas that I feel are already a
[00:29:54] little bit more intuitive already a
[00:29:56] little bit more familiar that I feel
[00:29:58] like are important building blocks for
[00:30:00] just understanding the overall scope of
[00:30:03] this topic and so by the end of my 2hour
[00:30:06] study session I can't recite every
[00:30:10] single sentence in here if you ask me
[00:30:13] what was the exact finding of a specific
[00:30:15] study or who said what about a
[00:30:17] particular Theory I can't tell you that
[00:30:20] but I would be able to say hey there are
[00:30:23] four major types of theories that share
[00:30:27] what seem to be these types of
[00:30:29] similarities but different these kinds
[00:30:32] of ways and they seem to relate to each
[00:30:34] other like this I can give you an
[00:30:36] overarching big picture but superficial
[00:30:39] overview of the topic and so I'm
[00:30:41] developing really high quality
[00:30:43] foundational knowledge but it's easier
[00:30:45] for me to do because I'm working with
[00:30:47] easier ideas that are more familiar to
[00:30:50] me and by building that Foundation I now
[00:30:54] have a great stepping stone for my next
[00:30:56] layer or the next rung on the scaffold
[00:30:59] so I can go through this information
[00:31:01] again and this time I can look at it at
[00:31:03] a higher level of detail because I have
[00:31:06] more knowledge about the topic so I now
[00:31:10] go through and still pick the things
[00:31:11] that feel more familiar and easy to me
[00:31:13] and what you will find is that that
[00:31:15] paragraph that you read the first time
[00:31:17] and you thought man I have no idea what
[00:31:19] it's talking about you read it now and
[00:31:21] you have new thoughts about it you think
[00:31:23] ah I actually see what it means because
[00:31:25] you have more things to connect it to
[00:31:28] and this is what I call the snowball
[00:31:30] effect of learning is that as you learn
[00:31:32] more and get deeper and deeper
[00:31:34] especially for big complex topics it
[00:31:36] should get easier and easier because you
[00:31:37] have more things to connect it to and
[00:31:40] more ways to make it intuitive and
[00:31:43] relevant lesson number eight build a
[00:31:46] learning system there is no single
[00:31:48] technique that you can learn that is a
[00:31:50] be all end all where as soon as you
[00:31:52] learn that technique you're done that
[00:31:53] doesn't exist and what that means is
[00:31:55] that you can't think of learning as a
[00:31:56] single technique or even two or three
[00:31:58] techniques you have to think about
[00:32:00] learning as an entire system composed of
[00:32:03] multiple techniques that work together
[00:32:05] to support each other and what I want to
[00:32:06] do for you is give you the basic
[00:32:08] component of what a learning system
[00:32:10] should be so that you can actually start
[00:32:13] building it the easiest way to think
[00:32:15] about a learning system is to track the
[00:32:18] path of a single piece of information
[00:32:20] it's almost like if you were to eat an
[00:32:21] apple like a bite of an apple you're
[00:32:22] just tracking the path of that bite
[00:32:24] through your body when is the first time
[00:32:27] that information comes in what do you do
[00:32:32] during that time and then what happens
[00:32:35] afterwards so for a lot of people let's
[00:32:37] say you're a university student for a
[00:32:39] lot of people the first time the
[00:32:40] information comes in is during a lecture
[00:32:43] and then what they do during that time
[00:32:45] is they write notes maybe annotate some
[00:32:48] stuff maybe record something Daydream
[00:32:51] fall asleep whatever it is and the next
[00:32:54] part where they look at that same piece
[00:32:56] of information might be in a review
[00:32:58] session if you're proactive later that
[00:33:01] day same day or it could be the day
[00:33:04] after or maybe a week later or if you're
[00:33:06] not really so on top of your studying
[00:33:07] you don't review it until just before
[00:33:08] your exam that's what most people's
[00:33:11] studying system looks like it's really
[00:33:13] not much of a system and so if this is
[00:33:14] your system then there are a lot of
[00:33:18] problems with this and it's no wonder
[00:33:20] that you may have difficulties for
[00:33:22] example if the first time you hear it is
[00:33:24] during a lecture where you have no
[00:33:25] control of the information p and your
[00:33:28] ability to process that information is
[00:33:30] not super high which some people
[00:33:33] naturally are super high and they're
[00:33:35] just very lucky but for most of us uh
[00:33:38] that processing level is not going to be
[00:33:40] super high without a lot of training so
[00:33:42] you're already sort of starting off of a
[00:33:44] back foot like someone's just throwing
[00:33:46] information at you and you're
[00:33:47] desperately trying to catch it but
[00:33:49] you're dropping half of it and then so
[00:33:50] later when you review it it's like
[00:33:53] almost as if you just may as well have
[00:33:54] just started studying it from scratch
[00:33:56] because there it's all fragmented and
[00:33:58] you've just got bits of knowledge here
[00:33:59] and there and you're just going to go
[00:34:01] through the same material again which is
[00:34:02] why a lot of people say well I need to
[00:34:04] go and rewatch that lecture it's like if
[00:34:06] you needed to rewatch the lecture anyway
[00:34:09] why did you even go just just don't go
[00:34:11] and just you know watch the lecture at
[00:34:13] your own pace so to prevent this the
[00:34:16] easiest way like I mentioned before is
[00:34:18] to not have that information hit you for
[00:34:21] the first time during a lecture so every
[00:34:25] effective Learning System should have a
[00:34:27] primary ing
[00:34:30] step and priming means that you are
[00:34:34] preparing your brain to catch instead of
[00:34:36] just throwing something at someone and
[00:34:39] then just expecting them to catch it you
[00:34:41] are saying hey I'm going to throw you
[00:34:43] this thing are you ready here's what it
[00:34:45] looks like here's how I'm going to throw
[00:34:46] it get ready to catch and they're going
[00:34:48] to position themselves to catch and it's
[00:34:50] going to be much easier to catch that's
[00:34:51] what you're doing for your brain you're
[00:34:53] priming your brain by giving it little
[00:34:56] anchor points basic structure a basic
[00:34:58] web of how to think about things main
[00:35:00] ideas tackling some of those difficult
[00:35:02] things that if you were to encounter it
[00:35:04] in the lecture that's going to be your
[00:35:06] brain like for the next minute and a
[00:35:09] half missing everything that they say do
[00:35:11] that upfront and this can be done very
[00:35:15] effectively like I said it can just be
[00:35:17] 20 30 minutes for a 1hour lecture to
[00:35:20] develop a really really good priming or
[00:35:23] pre-study and then following a priming
[00:35:25] event you should have your what I call a
[00:35:28] main learning event a main learning
[00:35:30] event means the first time you sit down
[00:35:33] with the intention to properly learn it
[00:35:35] and this tends to be a time intensive
[00:35:37] activity so this could be again if
[00:35:39] you're a university student your lecture
[00:35:42] attending the lecture could be the main
[00:35:43] learning event it's the first time where
[00:35:45] you are dedicatedly intensively sitting
[00:35:47] down to receive a high volume of
[00:35:49] information if you're not attending
[00:35:50] lectures it could be a dedicated
[00:35:53] intensive study session for that topic
[00:35:56] the priming session is not the main
[00:35:58] learning event because your intention is
[00:36:00] not to cover everything uh and it's
[00:36:02] usually much shorter so whether your
[00:36:04] main learning event is a lecture or a
[00:36:06] workshop or seminar or full day course
[00:36:08] or a long study session after the prime
[00:36:12] is the main learning event and during
[00:36:14] this main learning event we want to make
[00:36:16] sure that we are thinking actively we're
[00:36:18] thinking deeply about it and we're
[00:36:20] trying to avoid uh creating learning
[00:36:22] debt so we're really aiming for that
[00:36:24] effective
[00:36:26] learning not just creating debt for
[00:36:29] ourselves and after a main learning
[00:36:30] event we should always have a review now
[00:36:33] when you do the review or how often you
[00:36:36] do the review depends on how much
[00:36:39] material you're learning how complicated
[00:36:41] that material is and how good the
[00:36:43] processing you do in the main learning
[00:36:45] event is if you are very very good at
[00:36:47] processing and after learning something
[00:36:49] just one time you have a very high
[00:36:50] retention of it then you don't need to
[00:36:52] do a review for that for potentially a
[00:36:55] week or so but if you're learning
[00:36:58] strategies are not quite there yet and
[00:37:01] you know that if you wait a week you're
[00:37:03] already going to have forgotten 50 60%
[00:37:05] of it then you should do a review
[00:37:06] earlier and so as a rule of thumb if you
[00:37:09] just a general normal student is to try
[00:37:12] to review it one day one week then one
[00:37:15] month after and that timing is flexible
[00:37:18] like it doesn't have to be exact just
[00:37:19] try to do it within the first kind of
[00:37:21] one or two days and then roughly next
[00:37:24] weekish and then roughly sort of two to
[00:37:28] four to five weeks after that it's up to
[00:37:30] you to figure out your timing and how
[00:37:32] often you need to do your revisions but
[00:37:34] what's more important is actually what
[00:37:35] you do during those revision sessions so
[00:37:39] whenever you do the revision you should
[00:37:41] be actively looking for gaps and holes
[00:37:44] in your understanding you're not just
[00:37:46] trying to cover the stuff that you
[00:37:47] already know and are confident in you're
[00:37:49] actively looking for the parts that You'
[00:37:51] have missed or you've forgotten you
[00:37:52] should also be testing
[00:37:55] yourself rather than just using
[00:37:57] something like recognition where you
[00:37:59] just look at your notes and think yep
[00:38:00] that makes sense to me you should be
[00:38:01] testing it based on your memory and
[00:38:04] testing it in a way that's similar to
[00:38:05] how you know you're going to need it
[00:38:07] eventually so it usually means not just
[00:38:09] regurgitating facts but also more
[00:38:11] complex deeper types of thinking and as
[00:38:14] another tip try to address your biggest
[00:38:16] problems
[00:38:19] first so what this means is that if you
[00:38:21] fundamentally completely misunderstood a
[00:38:23] concept that's more important for you to
[00:38:25] spend your time to fix up than than a
[00:38:28] little fact or a detail that you forgot
[00:38:30] to recall major issues with how Concepts
[00:38:33] relate to each other are much more
[00:38:35] likely to impact your ability to perform
[00:38:37] for a much wider range of different
[00:38:39] tests or applications than just that
[00:38:42] single isolated fact and the longer you
[00:38:44] leave it the harder it gets to go and
[00:38:47] then like restudy all of that stuff if
[00:38:49] you realize a major error later on now
[00:38:52] as an optional part if you have a lot of
[00:38:54] stuff that you do think you need to just
[00:38:56] memorize that doesn't really connect
[00:38:58] with anything there isn't a deeper way
[00:38:59] to think about it and it's just a matter
[00:39:01] of like memorizing it through repetition
[00:39:04] then you should also be using some kind
[00:39:06] of memorization tool or technique and
[00:39:09] for most situations flash cars is a
[00:39:11] great place to start and that kind of
[00:39:13] runs in parallel to all of the stuff
[00:39:15] it's just you do the flash cards that
[00:39:17] are due whenever they are due just
[00:39:18] making sure that you're not creating so
[00:39:20] much learning debt that all of your time
[00:39:22] is spent just doing flash cards again I
[00:39:24] can go into this learning system in a
[00:39:26] lot more detail later on but this is
[00:39:29] what I would consider to be the major
[00:39:32] basic components of a learning system
[00:39:33] and if you're missing even one of these
[00:39:35] components there are probably going to
[00:39:37] be very clear issues with your
[00:39:41] performance or your consistency or your
[00:39:42] confidence that you could just literally
[00:39:44] point to what the problem is and the
[00:39:46] part that's missing in your learning
[00:39:47] system and connect the dots uh and I
[00:39:49] also if you're interested I've got a
[00:39:51] free quiz that you can do which will map
[00:39:54] out your learning system for you on some
[00:39:56] of the most important principles and it
[00:39:58] will output a score for the different
[00:40:01] sections of a learning system so that
[00:40:02] you can have a better idea of where to
[00:40:04] work on first if you're interested in
[00:40:06] that it's free for you to do there's a
[00:40:08] link in the description below number
[00:40:10] nine start simple and build slow if you
[00:40:14] just listen to me talk about this
[00:40:15] Learning System stuff and you feel like
[00:40:18] man I haven't got like any part of this
[00:40:20] Learning System there are so many things
[00:40:22] that I'm going to have to work on then
[00:40:25] that's fine don't worry like you along
[00:40:28] with everyone else are in the same boat
[00:40:30] I was in exactly the same position in
[00:40:31] fact I was in the same position but
[00:40:33] worse because no one told me what I had
[00:40:34] to work
[00:40:36] towards but the most important piece of
[00:40:39] advice I can give you for when you're
[00:40:41] improving your learning system is to
[00:40:44] build things slowly and swap out what
[00:40:47] you're already doing with simple
[00:40:50] strategies that work a really common
[00:40:53] mistake that I see my students make
[00:40:55] because when I teach people how to have
[00:40:57] a learning system I teach them like
[00:41:00] everything that they need to know like
[00:41:01] the stuff that took me years to figure
[00:41:03] out they're learning it in like three
[00:41:05] and a half lessons so they're exposed to
[00:41:09] so many different techniques that you
[00:41:11] know understandably they start trying to
[00:41:13] use all of these techniques all at the
[00:41:16] same time and so their Learning System
[00:41:17] kind of goes from zero to 100 in a
[00:41:19] single step and that's completely not
[00:41:21] sustainable there's no chance that
[00:41:23] you're going to be successful at
[00:41:25] learning if you try to change too many
[00:41:26] things too quickly uh and this is
[00:41:29] because a lot of the ways that you learn
[00:41:31] are habits and so you're you're really
[00:41:33] trying to unlearn and relearn new habits
[00:41:36] all at the same time and your brain is
[00:41:38] actually not biologically capable of
[00:41:41] making that much change so quickly so
[00:41:45] the much better approach that is going
[00:41:46] to help you to get better performance
[00:41:48] locked in as quickly as possible is just
[00:41:51] look at what you're already doing which
[00:41:52] may be like terrible okay that's fine
[00:41:56] wherever you're starting from just pick
[00:41:58] a strategy that you think could help you
[00:42:01] in a way and just swap out one part of
[00:42:04] what you're doing with that part and
[00:42:07] just slowly upgrade your system as each
[00:42:10] new thing becomes a habit and by doing
[00:42:13] that for every change you make you're
[00:42:16] going to get an improvement problems you
[00:42:18] have right now are going to be solved if
[00:42:21] you have 10 things that you trying to
[00:42:23] work on because you've got 10 different
[00:42:25] problems then you're going to have those
[00:42:28] 10 same problems until you fix all 10 of
[00:42:32] them it's much better to just take 10
[00:42:35] problems start with one and then have
[00:42:37] nine problems to deal with and then
[00:42:39] eight and then seven it's your life just
[00:42:41] progressively gets easier and easier but
[00:42:43] I can I can promise you that if you have
[00:42:47] all of these things to work on and you
[00:42:48] try to fix all of them at the same time
[00:42:50] you will spend a lot of time trying to
[00:42:53] work on lots of things and then after 3
[00:42:57] month realize that you still have the
[00:42:59] same problems and then you'll be back to
[00:43:01] square one deciding to just start with
[00:43:03] one thing all over again you will just
[00:43:05] waste that time I promise you that this
[00:43:07] will happen so please just start simple
[00:43:10] and build slow lesson number 10 create a
[00:43:14] learning log if I think back to when I
[00:43:17] was first in uni and I think about now I
[00:43:21] cannot even count the number of
[00:43:23] experiments and trials that I've run
[00:43:26] with the way that I study it it's
[00:43:28] literally will be in the thousands and
[00:43:31] it's unavoidable for any learner trying
[00:43:34] to become more efficient if what you're
[00:43:36] doing is trying to improve the process
[00:43:38] and not just win through effort alone
[00:43:41] which we already said is usually not
[00:43:43] possible you are going to have to do a
[00:43:45] lot of trial and error and
[00:43:46] experimentation and even if you are
[00:43:48] starting simple and building slow there
[00:43:51] are lots of things that will be on your
[00:43:53] mind for you to try to improve on and
[00:43:54] lots of ideas and that's a good thing
[00:43:57] the problem is that it can be very
[00:43:58] overwhelming and I spent the first solid
[00:44:01] few years working on multiple different
[00:44:05] things here and there and not really
[00:44:08] making the type of progress that I
[00:44:10] should have made for the amount of time
[00:44:11] I was spending because I was just
[00:44:13] dabbling in so many different types of
[00:44:15] techniques and avenues of improvement
[00:44:17] and instead what I should have been
[00:44:18] doing is just picking One path improving
[00:44:21] that fixing this problem doing enough
[00:44:24] trial and error until that problem is
[00:44:25] gone and then moving on to the next one
[00:44:27] and then again doing that
[00:44:29] experimentation stacking those gains
[00:44:31] until that problem is gone and to make
[00:44:33] it much easier to figure out which
[00:44:34] direction you're heading in and how to
[00:44:36] stack those experiments and fix that
[00:44:39] problem and to move more effectively a
[00:44:41] learning log is extremely helpful a
[00:44:44] learning log is basically a record of
[00:44:46] the experiments you're doing what you're
[00:44:48] trying to do with that experiment why
[00:44:51] you're doing it and then how that
[00:44:52] experiment went it's like a record of
[00:44:55] your progress and I previously talked
[00:44:57] about a learning log in another video
[00:44:59] and a lot of you guys wanted me to show
[00:45:02] you how to actually create a learning
[00:45:04] log so I'll give you a basic template
[00:45:06] that you could follow right now uh you
[00:45:08] can do this on anything um at the time I
[00:45:11] just used a Google sheet uh but you
[00:45:13] could use notion you could use Rome or
[00:45:14] obsidian or whatever it is that you want
[00:45:16] it really doesn't matter there are
[00:45:17] really six core parts of what creates an
[00:45:20] effective learning log the first part is
[00:45:24] what your experiment or experence ience
[00:45:27] is this is usually just like one or two
[00:45:30] sentences about what you're trying to do
[00:45:32] what change you're trying to make the
[00:45:34] second part is defining what progress
[00:45:37] looks like for you this makes it much
[00:45:39] easier to realize if you are going in
[00:45:42] the right direction or not so for
[00:45:44] example if you are trying a new
[00:45:45] technique for the very very first time
[00:45:47] then progress for you is not going to be
[00:45:50] yeah I figured it out and I fixed it
[00:45:52] like in one single go otherwise you you
[00:45:54] would need a learning log right you just
[00:45:56] find a problem you fix it and you're
[00:45:57] done but it takes trial and error to fix
[00:46:00] it so your initial stages of progress
[00:46:02] with a new technique is not going to be
[00:46:05] I solved the problem it's going to be I
[00:46:08] realized a barrier or an obstacle or a
[00:46:10] challenge that I didn't expect with this
[00:46:14] solution and this experiment I realized
[00:46:16] more about the problem than I knew
[00:46:19] before and you're equipping yourself
[00:46:21] with more information to later be able
[00:46:24] to solve it and it's only in the later
[00:46:27] experiments that you're actually likely
[00:46:29] to properly fix it so you want to spend
[00:46:32] the second time writing a few sentences
[00:46:34] about what you think would be a win for
[00:46:37] you so the experiment is I'm going to
[00:46:38] try mind mapping then the progress
[00:46:41] condition is I tried mind mapping and I
[00:46:44] found a couple of challenges with doing
[00:46:47] this effectively that I didn't realize
[00:46:49] before and by taking the time to write
[00:46:51] it up front it's much more motivating
[00:46:53] and it keeps a more accurate count of
[00:46:56] the progress we're making with our skill
[00:46:57] development as opposed to thinking we're
[00:47:00] not making any progress uh because we
[00:47:02] haven't fixed the issue when actually
[00:47:04] we're making really good progress we
[00:47:05] just didn't realize it the third part is
[00:47:08] a reflection of how it actually went so
[00:47:11] this is you now doing the thing that you
[00:47:13] tried to do and you're reflecting on how
[00:47:15] you found it here the key is to just be
[00:47:17] very specific about what actually
[00:47:19] happened and not make broad overarching
[00:47:21] statements or try to rationalize why
[00:47:24] things happened because that's the next
[00:47:26] part number four is Trends and
[00:47:30] habits Trends and habits is about
[00:47:32] looking at what happened in your
[00:47:34] reflection which is basically just like
[00:47:36] a data dump of what happened when you
[00:47:38] tried the experiment and now you're
[00:47:40] looking at it very critically to see are
[00:47:42] there any patterns or similarities or
[00:47:44] Trends with previous experiences or
[00:47:47] experiments or habits about myself about
[00:47:50] the way I tend to think or respond to
[00:47:52] certain things that I can see occur
[00:47:55] again and again this this is really
[00:47:57] where most of your improvement is going
[00:47:59] to come from it's your ability to
[00:48:01] realize certain habits and patterns of
[00:48:03] thinking that consistently hold you back
[00:48:05] a really common one for example let's
[00:48:07] say you tried mind mapping and then you
[00:48:09] did it and then you found all these
[00:48:10] difficulties with it the trend could be
[00:48:13] that every time I do a type of learning
[00:48:16] that makes me think more deeply I tend
[00:48:19] to think that it's not working and so I
[00:48:22] go back to doing what I'm used to I'm
[00:48:25] not used to making learning like that
[00:48:27] could be a really really key insight and
[00:48:29] you can see how realizing that is just
[00:48:33] like completely life transforming in
[00:48:34] terms of your ability to improve number
[00:48:36] five is thinking about the actions that
[00:48:38] you can take based on those insights so
[00:48:40] you'll find a bunch of different Trends
[00:48:42] a bunch of things that you think you can
[00:48:43] improve on for next time and
[00:48:44] optimizations that you can make and then
[00:48:47] you turn those into action items for you
[00:48:49] to work on so that in number six you
[00:48:54] prioritize like I said start simple
[00:48:57] build slow if you've got 10 different
[00:48:59] things that you realize that you can
[00:49:01] improve on you can't work on all 10 of
[00:49:03] those things so pick just one or two for
[00:49:05] you to focus on and that becomes your
[00:49:07] next experiment that you add to your log
[00:49:10] and anytime you're feeling little
[00:49:12] demotivated just scroll back like two
[00:49:15] months ago in your log and think about
[00:49:17] the problems and the way that you
[00:49:18] thought about it then versus how you
[00:49:20] think about it now and you'll realize
[00:49:22] this process just transforms you it is
[00:49:25] this process repeated hundreds and
[00:49:29] thousands of times that allowed me to go
[00:49:32] from a desperate student working 20
[00:49:35] hours a day to just barely hang in there
[00:49:37] to someone who studied so little people
[00:49:40] asked me how do I do all the other
[00:49:43] things that I do lesson 11 measure your
[00:49:47] true learning efficiency there's a
[00:49:49] student that I've just recently finished
[00:49:52] coaching uh who's a surgical trainee so
[00:49:55] they're a registered doctor they are
[00:49:56] they've been practicing for nine or 10
[00:50:00] years now and they just about finished
[00:50:02] with their General surgical training
[00:50:04] program they're one step away from being
[00:50:06] like a senior senior doctor and they've
[00:50:09] already failed this exam one time and
[00:50:12] they're really really motivated to crack
[00:50:15] it on their second go and so we got to a
[00:50:16] point in this coaching where we had
[00:50:19] figured out a really really good system
[00:50:21] for him to use that worked alongside his
[00:50:24] his high workload and how him find those
[00:50:27] tiny little gaps and address them
[00:50:29] effectively and we'd run it for a couple
[00:50:31] of weeks and he was finding that it was
[00:50:33] it was working it was working really
[00:50:34] well and then a week passes and he sends
[00:50:37] me this email before the next
[00:50:39] consultation where he says hey Justin I
[00:50:40] feel like something is really going
[00:50:42] wrong here I feel really really slow I
[00:50:44] feel like my learning is actually
[00:50:46] slipping backwards I feel like I'm
[00:50:48] getting worse than before when I started
[00:50:50] so I was like cool we should well not
[00:50:53] cool but let's address this so we caught
[00:50:55] up and in the consultation I asked him
[00:50:58] what was going on and this is basically
[00:51:00] the story that he painted he said that
[00:51:02] before he would have a single piece of
[00:51:05] uh a topic that he would need to cover
[00:51:08] and covering that topic would take him
[00:51:09] around 3
[00:51:11] hours and now it was taking him like 5
[00:51:15] hours to cover that same topic and he's
[00:51:18] still not able to perform in certain
[00:51:22] ways like he used to be able to before
[00:51:24] when a seniors would ask him certain
[00:51:26] chrans he would be able to recall a lot
[00:51:29] more of those facts and those
[00:51:31] details than he is able to now and now
[00:51:34] when a senior is asking the questions
[00:51:36] sometimes he doesn't actually know
[00:51:37] because he hasn't gotten to a point
[00:51:39] where he feels solid on that knowledge
[00:51:41] yet so when you look at this someone
[00:51:43] going from 3 hours to 5 hours that seems
[00:51:47] like a clear situation where their
[00:51:48] efficiency has gone down right not quite
[00:51:52] so I said okay let's think about what's
[00:51:53] happening right now are you able to get
[00:51:56] to a point where you can use your
[00:51:59] knowledge think about it together and
[00:52:01] apply them in more complicated ways
[00:52:04] where you can have a curveball an
[00:52:06] unusual case and you know how to think
[00:52:08] about it and how to navigate that topic
[00:52:10] like you feel you have a good intuitive
[00:52:12] understanding of that topic and he said
[00:52:13] yes I feel like I'm able to achieve that
[00:52:15] now so we call that a high level so are
[00:52:18] you able to achieve a high level right
[00:52:20] now yes how long does it take you okay
[00:52:22] it takes about that 5 hours to cover the
[00:52:25] topic Plus I'm now spending maybe an
[00:52:28] extra hour of reviewing that information
[00:52:30] later so in total it's taking me about 6
[00:52:32] hours okay and what about the low level
[00:52:35] so you're saying that you're not able to
[00:52:36] reach that low level they said yeah
[00:52:38] right now I'm able to reach about 50% of
[00:52:41] that low level in the same 6 hours that
[00:52:44] I'm spending so I said okay well now
[00:52:45] let's compare that to what we were doing
[00:52:47] before so you said before it was taking
[00:52:48] you 3 hours to cover this topic so
[00:52:52] before were you able to get to this high
[00:52:55] level where you have that intuitive
[00:52:57] understanding and you're able to think
[00:52:59] about the topic in multiple different
[00:53:01] ways and use them in these complex
[00:53:03] applications and he said no that's
[00:53:05] something that I've I've always
[00:53:07] struggled with he said that he remembers
[00:53:09] being early on a junior in a training
[00:53:11] program and and really struggling with
[00:53:13] that so I said okay well how many hours
[00:53:15] would you spend on trying to reach this
[00:53:17] level not including just going over at
[00:53:20] the first time but in terms of time
[00:53:21] spent going over it again and again and
[00:53:24] testing yourself again and all these
[00:53:25] other repetitions bu he said well easily
[00:53:27] like over 20
[00:53:29] hours and after 20 hours were you able
[00:53:32] to get there he said no he still was not
[00:53:35] able to get there most of the time so I
[00:53:37] said okay well what about these this low
[00:53:39] level what were you able to get to so he
[00:53:41] said yeah low level was really good he
[00:53:42] was able to get to 90% plus of that low
[00:53:45] level and was it in the 3 hours that he
[00:53:48] said no the 3 hours was just the amount
[00:53:51] of time taken to cover the information
[00:53:53] the first time and when I asked them how
[00:53:56] long long it took to cover that
[00:53:58] information again and again how many
[00:54:00] times you had to repeat it to learn it
[00:54:03] it was double that amount of times so
[00:54:04] was 6
[00:54:05] hours so now this is a very different
[00:54:08] picture he has gone from spending six
[00:54:11] total hours including all the relearning
[00:54:14] of stuff that he had forgotten to get to
[00:54:16] 90% here and spending 20 plus hours
[00:54:19] really Infinity because he never was
[00:54:21] able to reach this and now he's gone to
[00:54:24] a point where in six hours he is
[00:54:27] reaching this a level he's never been
[00:54:29] able to reach regardless of how much
[00:54:31] time he spent on this and yes his
[00:54:33] lowlevel Factory call is suffering at
[00:54:35] the moment but we've got plenty of hours
[00:54:38] to spare that we can just plug in to The
[00:54:40] lowlevel Simple Solutions add a few
[00:54:43] flash cards do some memorization to pad
[00:54:46] that up and this is how you look at
[00:54:48] learning efficiency learning efficiency
[00:54:50] is not how long does it take to cover a
[00:54:53] topic covering a topic means nothing
[00:54:56] learning efficiency is how long does it
[00:54:59] take in total to reach the level you
[00:55:04] need to reach and most people that
[00:55:08] struggle with their studying spend an
[00:55:11] infinite amount of time because they
[00:55:13] never reach the level no matter how much
[00:55:16] time they spend and when you look at
[00:55:17] these two
[00:55:18] situations which person would you rather
[00:55:21] be this one or this one listen number 12
[00:55:25] make confidence answer sheets this is
[00:55:29] what I think may be one of the easiest
[00:55:32] and most underrated ways of using
[00:55:34] practice questions and past papers when
[00:55:37] I was going through medical school I
[00:55:38] used to do so many practice questions
[00:55:41] there was this website that I'd sign up
[00:55:43] to and it had like I think like an
[00:55:45] endless number of questions that I could
[00:55:47] do uh that tested me in a way that was
[00:55:49] similar to how the university would test
[00:55:50] me and everyone everyone in my class
[00:55:52] used this um used this service and it
[00:55:54] was great the problem is is that I was
[00:55:58] doing so many questions like thousands
[00:56:00] of questions in order for me to gain a
[00:56:04] four five 6% increase in my performance
[00:56:07] and there are so many times where there
[00:56:09] was something that I covered in those
[00:56:11] practice questions and then a very
[00:56:13] similar question comes up in an exam and
[00:56:16] I just can't remember and I still get it
[00:56:18] wrong and the same thing happens at at
[00:56:20] all levels like that surgical traine
[00:56:21] that I was talking to about just before
[00:56:23] the reason that they failed their final
[00:56:24] examination was because of way that they
[00:56:26] had been preparing had these gaps that
[00:56:29] they had never realized like they hadn't
[00:56:31] gotten enough feedback from their
[00:56:32] seniors to realize that there was this
[00:56:34] part of thinking about the topic that
[00:56:36] they hadn't thought of before and making
[00:56:38] a confidence answer sheet solves that a
[00:56:42] confidence answer sheet means you take a
[00:56:45] set of practice questions which you can
[00:56:47] get from anywhere and when you do them
[00:56:50] do not look at an answer sheet first
[00:56:54] instead go through each question
[00:56:56] and rate your confidence of your answer
[00:57:00] this becomes the most important piece of
[00:57:02] information for you to improve after
[00:57:04] you've made your confidence sheet go
[00:57:06] through everything that you had a low
[00:57:09] level of confidence for and study it to
[00:57:13] the point where you feel confident
[00:57:15] confident either in the fact that yep
[00:57:17] you actually got that wrong and now you
[00:57:18] definitely know the right answer or
[00:57:21] confident that yep you got the right
[00:57:22] answer but now you know for sure so get
[00:57:26] to a point where every single answer you
[00:57:27] wrote you have confidence on if you have
[00:57:30] low confidence for an answer it means
[00:57:33] that there is a gap in your knowledge
[00:57:34] there and even if you happen to have
[00:57:36] gotten the right answer it means that
[00:57:37] you could get a very similar question in
[00:57:39] the exam and then get it wrong it's you
[00:57:41] may have just gotten lucky so confidence
[00:57:44] is actually the most important indicator
[00:57:45] of your knowledge once you do your
[00:57:47] studying to get to a high level of
[00:57:49] confidence for all of your answers you
[00:57:51] can then compare that to the real answer
[00:57:53] sheet and that can reveal another layer
[00:57:54] of mistakes because you can have
[00:57:56] something that you initially had very
[00:57:57] high confidence on and so you didn't
[00:57:59] bother studying that more but then when
[00:58:01] you take the actual answers it turns out
[00:58:03] to be wrong that is almost always a
[00:58:07] major red flag like that is a high
[00:58:10] priority area for you to study again
[00:58:12] because there is probably a significant
[00:58:15] issue with how you've understood it or a
[00:58:17] significant Gap in your knowledge high
[00:58:19] confidence with a wrong answer means
[00:58:21] that you don't even have the awareness
[00:58:24] of the problem that is a high priority
[00:58:27] for you to spend your time to study more
[00:58:28] into alternatively there may be
[00:58:30] something that was a low confidence that
[00:58:32] you studied to get to a high confidence
[00:58:34] but then you check the answer and it's
[00:58:35] still wrong again that means that that's
[00:58:37] something that you should go in and
[00:58:38] study a little bit more because it means
[00:58:39] that the way that you thought about that
[00:58:41] topic was flawed in some way there was
[00:58:44] probably some kind of angle you were
[00:58:45] missing or some relationship or
[00:58:47] connection between the ideas that you
[00:58:48] didn't quite see uh which meant that
[00:58:51] even after studying it you weren't able
[00:58:54] to connect the dots the reason this type
[00:58:56] of error is important is because it
[00:58:57] tells you about the way you tend to
[00:58:59] think about information if you made that
[00:59:01] mistake here then you've probably made
[00:59:03] that mistake somewhere else as well if
[00:59:05] you use this confidence answer sheet
[00:59:08] system I can guarantee you the amount of
[00:59:12] questions and practice you need to do to
[00:59:15] develop real confidence and plug those
[00:59:18] gaps in your knowledge will drop by at
[00:59:21] least half yes it does take a little bit
[00:59:23] longer to go through a set of questions
[00:59:26] but in terms of quality learning that
[00:59:29] happens per hour of you doing this
[00:59:31] activity it is like one of the most high
[00:59:35] yield valuable strategies that I have
[00:59:37] within my toolkit listen number 13 learn
[00:59:40] to swim before your drowning when I was
[00:59:43] in my second year of uni one of my
[00:59:44] classmates posted up something a week
[00:59:47] before the exam they were saying hey
[00:59:50] I've been studying this stuff and I feel
[00:59:53] like really overwhelmed I feel like I'm
[00:59:56] really behind on this what is the best
[00:59:58] thing I can do before this exam in just
[01:00:02] a few days from now and so I replied
[01:00:05] lower your
[01:00:07] standards and um that was I mean it was
[01:00:09] obviously a joke um it was my claim to
[01:00:12] fame it was liked by like 70 people in
[01:00:15] my class it was like the most popular
[01:00:16] I'd ever been um but I mean it's kind of
[01:00:21] true is that if you're feeling like I've
[01:00:24] only got a week left before my exam and
[01:00:27] I've got all the stuff I need to work on
[01:00:30] what can I do it's kind of like trying
[01:00:31] to learn to swim while you're already
[01:00:34] drowning it's you know there's maybe a
[01:00:37] few things that could potentially help
[01:00:39] here and there but really it's the
[01:00:41] position you're in in the first place
[01:00:43] and so if you are thinking about working
[01:00:46] on these skills and improving your
[01:00:47] learning efficiency that's great that's
[01:00:49] fantastic I want everyone that watches
[01:00:51] my videos to feel that way don't wait
[01:00:54] until you feel like it's imminent like
[01:00:57] you need it because by the time you feel
[01:00:58] like you need it it's probably because
[01:01:01] you know there's an exam coming up you
[01:01:03] know you're already falling behind
[01:01:04] something like that if you're already in
[01:01:06] that position it makes it so much harder
[01:01:08] for you to actually improve some of my
[01:01:10] students actually take a gap here just
[01:01:13] to work on their learning skills so that
[01:01:15] when they enter into the year they can
[01:01:16] just do it full force that's if you can
[01:01:18] like that's actually a really good
[01:01:19] strategy and I know that's not possible
[01:01:21] for everyone but if you're in the summer
[01:01:23] holidays and you've got a break study
[01:01:26] like cram ahead take your whole Year's
[01:01:28] curriculum that's about to come up use
[01:01:30] that as practice material to hone your
[01:01:33] your learning skills give yourself a
[01:01:34] time limit of how much to study give
[01:01:36] yourself tests to do and actually use
[01:01:39] that time or you can go to the beach and
[01:01:41] enjoy your life but like if you want to
[01:01:44] spend that time to develop your skills
[01:01:46] if it's really important to you and it
[01:01:47] means that you will have much better
[01:01:50] skills so that the year goes by more
[01:01:52] smoothly and as a added bonus because
[01:01:56] you use the actual material for that
[01:01:58] year you've also got a head start you
[01:02:01] did some early cramming and if you don't
[01:02:03] have access to that then you can even
[01:02:04] just make your own curriculum like you
[01:02:06] could get chat gbt to just literally
[01:02:07] generate a curriculum for you or you can
[01:02:09] use Wikipedia it doesn't have to be
[01:02:11] exactly the same as what you're about to
[01:02:13] cover even if it's 50% similar like
[01:02:15] that's a 50% Head Start and the primary
[01:02:18] benefit is that you're honing your
[01:02:20] skills without that external added
[01:02:22] pressure you're giving yourself that
[01:02:24] that hyperbolic time Cham the training
[01:02:26] time of being able to just focus on
[01:02:29] working on your skills and then go
[01:02:31] swimming if right now you feel like it's
[01:02:33] something that's worth pursuing next
[01:02:35] year it's going to be even more
[01:02:36] important it's not going to solve itself
[01:02:39] this is a lifelong skill so the earlier
[01:02:41] you develop it the more benefit you get
[01:02:43] for the rest of your life and if you
[01:02:45] want the best place to start on learning
[01:02:48] to swim and you'd rather save yourself
[01:02:50] some of that trial and error then
[01:02:51] remember that free quiz that I mentioned
[01:02:53] that helps you map out your learning
[01:02:55] system that link is in the description
[01:02:58] or if you want to just jump straight
[01:02:59] into it I've also got a training program
[01:03:01] that you can check out again the link to

=== Answering Your Top Study Questions In 39 Minutes ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scPiO65csRI

[00:00:00] I'm Dr Justin Sun I'm a learning coach
[00:00:02] and have been for the past 13 years and
[00:00:05] today I'll be answering your study
[00:00:07] questions on the internet let's get
[00:00:09] started hey yz8 V asks how to study for
[00:00:14] 12 hours every day without distractions
[00:00:17] it's really hard to solve a problem that
[00:00:20] you can't see and this is the problem
[00:00:22] when we talk about just distractions as
[00:00:25] a single word each distraction is unique
[00:00:28] and so while you could do a lot of
[00:00:30] techniques like pomodora or Fodor timers
[00:00:33] or wearing noise cancelling headphones
[00:00:34] and playing some white noise and these
[00:00:36] things will help you to focus and
[00:00:38] concentrate it's not going to work all
[00:00:39] the time and for every type of
[00:00:41] distraction the way you solve a phone
[00:00:43] notification distracting you versus
[00:00:46] someone knocking on your door are going
[00:00:48] to be different and so if you really
[00:00:49] want to get to a point where you can
[00:00:50] consistently focus and concentrate for
[00:00:52] long periods and know that you won't get
[00:00:55] distracted you have to start becoming
[00:00:56] aware of the specific distractions that
[00:01:00] enter into your focus zone and that
[00:01:02] helps us be specific and targeted as
[00:01:04] opposed to just removing distractions
[00:01:07] which is just too abstract questioned by
[00:01:10] a
[00:01:12] 5hw many students online claim to only
[00:01:15] use active recall and space repetition
[00:01:17] to get top grades so why do I say this
[00:01:22] isn't enough thanks for your question
[00:01:24] just because a successful person does
[00:01:26] something doesn't mean that's the reason
[00:01:29] they were successful when you look at
[00:01:31] the research around active recall and
[00:01:32] space repetition what we find is that in
[00:01:35] a university setting something along the
[00:01:37] lines of 80% of students tend to use
[00:01:39] that as a technique now are 80% of the
[00:01:43] students achieving top results
[00:01:46] definitely not statistically that's not
[00:01:48] possible it's not how many people at the
[00:01:50] top do something it's how many people
[00:01:53] that do this thing end up at the top
[00:01:56] there are millions of people that use
[00:01:59] active recall and based repetition and
[00:02:01] it is a significant and beneficial thing
[00:02:04] to do you should be doing it in your
[00:02:05] learning but for most of those people it
[00:02:09] is just not enough that is a fact the
[00:02:12] reason some people can get top results
[00:02:15] while doing nothing else is almost
[00:02:18] always because they have something
[00:02:20] that's called high deep processing which
[00:02:23] is their ability to extract Knowledge
[00:02:26] from information whenever you hear or
[00:02:29] read something your brain is processing
[00:02:31] that information and depending on how
[00:02:34] your brain processes that information it
[00:02:36] affects how good your memory and your
[00:02:38] ability to use that knowledge is going
[00:02:40] to be people with high deep processing
[00:02:42] are able to think about that information
[00:02:44] in such a way that they don't need a lot
[00:02:46] of other techniques to make it click and
[00:02:49] to see those connections now if you or
[00:02:51] most people have a lower level of deep
[00:02:54] processing then you can use the exact
[00:02:56] same strategy and not get the same
[00:02:59] result because because the issue is in
[00:03:00] the processing of information we would
[00:03:03] now need to supplement that with another
[00:03:05] technique or to train the Deep
[00:03:06] processing question by Navid nawab
[00:03:10] 9955 why do we postpone hard work every
[00:03:14] day and how can I end procrastination
[00:03:18] procrastination is a combination of a
[00:03:21] biological and a emotional response the
[00:03:24] human brain is not very good at picking
[00:03:27] a long-term goal and staying motivated
[00:03:30] towards it it favors shortterm good
[00:03:33] feelings hard work is energy consuming
[00:03:36] and difficult and usually doesn't give
[00:03:38] you that same dopamine Rush as playing
[00:03:42] games or scrolling on social media which
[00:03:44] is effortless and is designed to give us
[00:03:47] these dopamine spikes so biologically
[00:03:49] our brain tends to go down the easier
[00:03:52] energy conserving route because it
[00:03:54] doesn't care about you achieving your
[00:03:56] goals it cares about keeping you alive
[00:03:58] but the other part about procras ation
[00:04:00] is that it's often an emotional coping
[00:04:02] mechanism it is when we are faced with
[00:04:05] all of this effort and difficulty and
[00:04:07] uncertainty and it makes us feel
[00:04:09] apprehensive anxious uncertain or
[00:04:12] overwhelmed and so to deal with that
[00:04:14] emotion instead of solving the root
[00:04:17] problem which is to solve and do the
[00:04:18] work we cope by procrastinating which
[00:04:22] allows us to avoid that problem and
[00:04:24] avoid that feeling to properly end
[00:04:26] procrastination we need to have a number
[00:04:28] of things in place plan in advance break
[00:04:31] bigger tasks into smaller tasks learn to
[00:04:34] acknowledge and sit with that discomfort
[00:04:36] and train yourself to work through and
[00:04:38] just sit with these difficult emotions
[00:04:41] instead of trying to avoid and Escape
[00:04:43] them the Hallmark of an effective person
[00:04:45] is that they can do things when they
[00:04:46] don't feel like doing them Zen zq5 asks
[00:04:51] what are the best study techniques in
[00:04:54] general this is a bit like asking what
[00:04:56] are the best techniques for being alive
[00:04:58] in general all studying is is US
[00:05:01] deliberately deciding to learn something
[00:05:03] and that is an extremely Broad and
[00:05:06] complicated neurological process but if
[00:05:08] I had to answer it in just a few seconds
[00:05:11] the study techniques that will give you
[00:05:13] the best return are the ones that will
[00:05:16] help test your understanding find your
[00:05:19] gaps and force you to think about
[00:05:21] material in an interconnected way that
[00:05:24] involves comparing contrasting and
[00:05:26] making value judgments about what you're
[00:05:28] learning that's called higher order
[00:05:30] learning someone who engages in
[00:05:32] comparative higher order learning and
[00:05:35] tests themselves will probably have 70
[00:05:38] to 80% of their bases covered the hard
[00:05:40] part is actually getting good at that
[00:05:42] orc 2013 asks how do some people Ace
[00:05:46] their exams without studying is this a
[00:05:49] myth or a lie I used to ask myself this
[00:05:51] question all the time going through
[00:05:52] medical school cuz when you're in
[00:05:54] medical school you're surrounded by a
[00:05:56] lot of really smart people and I would
[00:05:59] be studying all day in the library and
[00:06:01] then I'd look outside the window and I'd
[00:06:02] see these guys just like chatting and
[00:06:05] doing whatever and like playing sports
[00:06:07] and I'd be thinking when do they ever
[00:06:09] actually study and those same people
[00:06:12] would do better than me in the exams so
[00:06:13] here's the truth let's think about four
[00:06:15] different variables that affect your
[00:06:17] ability to pass an exam the first one is
[00:06:19] your deep processing that's what I
[00:06:21] explained before basically it's like
[00:06:23] your natural intelligence which you can
[00:06:25] actually train the second thing is your
[00:06:27] study strategies and your techniques and
[00:06:29] how effective they are at activating
[00:06:32] effective learning processes in the
[00:06:34] brain third is how much time and effort
[00:06:35] you spend on actually studying to use
[00:06:37] these first two and the final one is the
[00:06:40] difficulty of the exam when an exam is
[00:06:43] easy enough all you need is just one of
[00:06:46] these first three factors to be decent
[00:06:48] enough to get you over the line and as
[00:06:51] exams become more and more difficult you
[00:06:53] need one of these three things to be
[00:06:56] higher and higher until a certain point
[00:06:58] where all three of these things need to
[00:07:00] be very high this is why at the top
[00:07:02] levels for the most competitive
[00:07:04] situations you're are not getting anyone
[00:07:06] who's not putting a decent amount of
[00:07:08] time and effort into studying that
[00:07:10] doesn't have pretty good techniques and
[00:07:11] doesn't have high deep processing and if
[00:07:13] someone is passing a difficult exam
[00:07:16] without studying at all and their
[00:07:18] techniques don't seem special then you
[00:07:20] can be guaranteed that their deep
[00:07:22] processing is Sky High and if that's you
[00:07:26] lucky you by the way if you are
[00:07:27] interested in actually measuring your
[00:07:29] your deep processing ability then I've
[00:07:32] got this free learner type quiz that you
[00:07:34] can take it asks you a few questions
[00:07:36] about three of the evidence-based
[00:07:38] dimensions of learning I've identified
[00:07:41] of which one of them is deep processing
[00:07:43] and so then give you a quantitative
[00:07:46] score out of a 100 for your deep
[00:07:48] processing ability at the end it also
[00:07:50] gives you some steps on how to improve
[00:07:51] that deep processing ability so if you
[00:07:53] want to give that quiz a try it's
[00:07:54] totally free I'll put a link to it in
[00:07:56] the description now on to the next
[00:07:58] question BAS H me asks everything gets
[00:08:01] boring whenever I am reading or learning
[00:08:04] something is there a solution I vividly
[00:08:06] remember being in high school sitting in
[00:08:08] the library spending time studying and
[00:08:12] then almost every single day falling
[00:08:14] asleep studying during that time was the
[00:08:17] most boring tedious drowsy inducing
[00:08:21] activity I could do I could have had a
[00:08:23] perfect night's rest energetic as soon
[00:08:26] as I start studying 30 minutes in I just
[00:08:27] want to take a nap this is actually a
[00:08:30] sign of passive learning it's when
[00:08:33] you're sitting down doing some kind of
[00:08:35] studying or learning activity that's
[00:08:37] very ineffective what that means is that
[00:08:39] it's not engaging your brain and
[00:08:42] activating the right Pathways for
[00:08:44] learning to take place if you do 2 hours
[00:08:47] of passive learning you'll feel like
[00:08:48] it's very boring and at the end of it
[00:08:51] your memory and your ability to use the
[00:08:52] knowledge will not be very good learning
[00:08:55] itself is something that your brain
[00:08:57] really enjoys most people who hate
[00:09:00] studying still love learning something
[00:09:03] and if you look at studies that measure
[00:09:05] the actual electrical activity of the
[00:09:07] brain doing effective Active Learning
[00:09:10] which is more engaging and requires more
[00:09:12] effort then it's spiking a lot there's a
[00:09:15] lot of activity and when you look at the
[00:09:17] brain of someone who's engaging in
[00:09:19] passive learning just like reading
[00:09:22] rereading mindlessly just writing down
[00:09:24] notes then it's almost the same as
[00:09:27] someone that's entering into the first
[00:09:28] stage of sleep
[00:09:30] SOI the solution is to engage your brain
[00:09:35] by thinking more actively about what you
[00:09:37] are consuming feeling that learning is
[00:09:39] boring is almost always a sign that the
[00:09:42] way you are learning is not effective PV
[00:09:46] sures 9342 asks what is the best way to
[00:09:50] learn procedural parts of a subject such
[00:09:52] as solving math problems what processes
[00:09:55] should we engage in besides over
[00:09:57] practicing procedural learning is about
[00:10:00] taking what you have learned and then
[00:10:01] applying and executing on that over
[00:10:03] practicing is a technique where you're
[00:10:05] not just practicing like solving a
[00:10:07] problem until you're able to solve it
[00:10:09] correctly you then continue to solve
[00:10:11] many more of those types of problems
[00:10:13] beyond the point where you reach
[00:10:14] competency and the idea is that over
[00:10:16] practicing can increase your fluency and
[00:10:17] speed of recall it's also called
[00:10:19] overlearning there are two things that I
[00:10:21] think commonly hold people back from
[00:10:22] developing procedural expertise for
[00:10:25] something like solving a math problem
[00:10:27] the first part is that they don't do
[00:10:28] enough inter Le and the second part is
[00:10:30] that they think they have a procedural
[00:10:31] issue when it's not interleaving your
[00:10:34] practice means that instead of just
[00:10:35] practicing like the same question again
[00:10:37] and again and again well like variations
[00:10:39] of the same style of question you're
[00:10:41] actually mixing them with other types of
[00:10:44] questions and sometimes even just other
[00:10:46] topics or other Concepts inter leing has
[00:10:48] been shown in the research repeatedly to
[00:10:50] be an incredibly effective way of
[00:10:51] developing expertise and procedural
[00:10:53] skill the simple way that I like to
[00:10:55] think about interleaving is that you're
[00:10:56] hitting a topic from multiple different
[00:10:58] angles and multiple different levels so
[00:11:00] don't just solve this type of problem in
[00:11:02] exactly the same way mix it up merge it
[00:11:05] with another concept create a problem
[00:11:07] that involves two different concepts
[00:11:09] together or put it in a different type
[00:11:11] of context that's a little bit different
[00:11:13] to how you initially learned it think
[00:11:14] about the more complex types of problems
[00:11:16] you might have to solve and then test
[00:11:18] your ability to solve the more
[00:11:19] complicated ones now the second issue
[00:11:20] was that you can be mistaken in thinking
[00:11:23] of a procedural issue because you tried
[00:11:25] to solve a complicated problem and then
[00:11:27] you got it wrong most of the time when
[00:11:28] you can't solve complicated problems is
[00:11:31] because you actually didn't know the
[00:11:32] approach and strategy for solving it as
[00:11:35] opposed to not being able to do the
[00:11:37] procedural actual working it out part
[00:11:41] and that is actually not procedural
[00:11:42] knowledge that is declarative or
[00:11:43] otherwise conceptual knowledge so if you
[00:11:46] keep getting complicated high level
[00:11:47] questions wrong it indicates that when
[00:11:49] you first learned it you didn't pay
[00:11:51] enough attention to how the different
[00:11:52] concepts relate to and influence and
[00:11:55] work with each other having that
[00:11:57] conceptual knowledge is what helps you
[00:11:58] to figure figure out the strategy and
[00:12:00] approach to solve a problem Risa mine
[00:12:04] 4816 how do you study systematically
[00:12:07] when navigating many different resources
[00:12:10] such as lecture slides videos short
[00:12:11] books summary notes YouTube videos
[00:12:12] multiple textbooks let's say that I
[00:12:14] asked you what are the ingredients that
[00:12:17] I need to make a beef lasagna you would
[00:12:21] probably search it up on Google find a
[00:12:24] recipe that seems okay and then tell me
[00:12:26] what the ingredients are or maybe if you
[00:12:28] just happened to have a cookbook next to
[00:12:29] you then you could tell me or if you
[00:12:31] already know it you'll just tell me off
[00:12:32] the top of your head now technically
[00:12:35] there
[00:12:36] are tens of thousands of places that you
[00:12:39] could have gotten that information from
[00:12:42] and yet it's not overwhelming to think
[00:12:44] about where can I get that information
[00:12:46] from because it doesn't really matter
[00:12:49] it's the same thing with learning
[00:12:51] learning from multiple resources is very
[00:12:54] overwhelming if you are just a passenger
[00:12:57] of The Learning Journey and information
[00:12:59] is being thrown at you and you're just
[00:13:01] trying to do something with it if that's
[00:13:04] a situation you're already going to be
[00:13:06] on a back foot with everything to do
[00:13:07] with learning moving forward the trick
[00:13:09] to becoming an effective learner is to
[00:13:10] start driving it yourself you have to
[00:13:13] actively be thinking about what you're
[00:13:15] about to learn what information you will
[00:13:17] need and you are seeking the information
[00:13:20] to get it some types of information it's
[00:13:23] better to get it from a lecture
[00:13:25] sometimes it's better to search it up on
[00:13:26] Google get it from a YouTube video and
[00:13:28] so when you first start learning
[00:13:29] something spend a little bit of time
[00:13:32] getting a general sense for what type of
[00:13:35] information you can get from these
[00:13:37] different sources and then develop the
[00:13:39] skill to be active when you're learning
[00:13:42] to think about what information that you
[00:13:44] need why you need that and how that's
[00:13:46] going to help you to understand the
[00:13:48] bigger picture of what you're learning
[00:13:49] once you start doing that not only does
[00:13:51] it become easier to work with multiple
[00:13:53] resources but you will find that your
[00:13:55] memory your ability to understand
[00:13:57] information your ability to apply
[00:13:59] information and just to learn it deeply
[00:14:02] increases by folds in fact I actually
[00:14:05] believe that until you start thinking
[00:14:07] about learning this way there is a hard
[00:14:09] ceiling to how efficient your learning
[00:14:12] can ever be because you are always
[00:14:14] reactive to the information given to you
[00:14:17] question
[00:14:18] from just one
[00:14:20] h1m if you had to give just one piece of
[00:14:23] advice on how to study what would it
[00:14:26] be that's a good question don't try to
[00:14:30] make studying faster or easier until you
[00:14:34] figured out how to make it effective and
[00:14:38] effective studying usually means it
[00:14:40] feels harder being fast at studying is
[00:14:43] when you can do something habitually
[00:14:46] learn to do the hard thing until it
[00:14:48] becomes a habit then it becomes fast and
[00:14:51] effective the biggest gain of efficiency
[00:14:53] you can make is not in how you time your
[00:14:57] repetitions and your reviews
[00:14:59] it's in just forgetting less the first
[00:15:02] time you learn it it's about learning it
[00:15:05] properly the first time to give yourself
[00:15:07] less baggage to deal with and less of a
[00:15:10] gap to chase later the future version of
[00:15:12] you has enough problems to deal with
[00:15:14] when you learn to learn effectively and
[00:15:16] engage the effort in the right ways
[00:15:19] speed and efficiency comes automatically
[00:15:22] it's impossible not to have the speed
[00:15:23] and efficiency if the effectiveness is
[00:15:25] there so koku suuki asks any advice on
[00:15:29] how to review old materials while also
[00:15:31] learning new material simultaneously on
[00:15:34] a consistent basis if you're on a boat
[00:15:36] and water is coming through cuz there's
[00:15:38] a hole on the side of the
[00:15:39] boat your number one objective becomes
[00:15:42] to plug that leak there's no point
[00:15:44] spending time on bucketing water out of
[00:15:47] the boat Because unless you can bucket
[00:15:50] really fast and you're prepared to
[00:15:52] bucket for the rest of your life you're
[00:15:53] eventually just going to sink the
[00:15:55] problem is the leak same thing with
[00:15:58] learning if you have material that you
[00:16:00] are either falling behind on or you're
[00:16:03] forgetting it so quickly and at such
[00:16:06] high volumes that you're having to spend
[00:16:09] a lot of time on just reviewing the same
[00:16:11] thing you learned before that's the leak
[00:16:14] it means that the way you learned it
[00:16:15] initially was of a low quality that's
[00:16:18] reflected in a low memory things you
[00:16:20] learn to a high quality stick in your
[00:16:24] memory more easily if you find out one
[00:16:26] day that your sibling is
[00:16:29] just got married you're not going to
[00:16:32] forget that you're not going to wake up
[00:16:33] the next day someone tells you and be
[00:16:34] like oh yeah like that was there you're
[00:16:36] not going to create a flash card like my
[00:16:38] sibling got married and just do it every
[00:16:40] single day it sticks because the
[00:16:42] information is relevant it's connected
[00:16:44] and exists within a schema of knowledge
[00:16:48] that influences other pieces of
[00:16:50] knowledge inside that schema that's what
[00:16:52] it means for knowledge to be relevant
[00:16:54] now you might be thinking when I'm
[00:16:55] studying that knowledge is not that
[00:16:57] relevant but you can make it relevant
[00:17:00] think about an expert in a field they
[00:17:02] can learn the strangest tiniest little
[00:17:05] fact and detail that they read from some
[00:17:07] research article that for you you might
[00:17:09] think this is like a random irrelevant
[00:17:12] detail for them it will stick because
[00:17:14] when they read it they think oh if this
[00:17:16] is the case and this and this and this
[00:17:18] the network is there so if you don't
[00:17:20] have a network then you're going to lose
[00:17:22] things very quickly from your memory the
[00:17:24] key there is to plug the leak by start
[00:17:27] building knowledge in Networks rather
[00:17:29] than an isolation this is higher order
[00:17:30] learning now the other part is that you
[00:17:32] want to make sure that your backlog of
[00:17:34] things that you need to review doesn't
[00:17:36] just keep growing so if there's new
[00:17:38] material coming up prioritize learning
[00:17:41] that stuff really well and get ahead if
[00:17:43] you need to to give yourself that extra
[00:17:45] room and buffer spend time away from
[00:17:48] reviewing the old stuff and spend more
[00:17:50] time on making sure that the new stuff
[00:17:52] you're about to learn doesn't need to be
[00:17:54] reviewed so frequently once you do that
[00:17:57] you can slowly start propor portioning a
[00:17:59] little bit of time here and there to
[00:18:01] review your catalog of old material that
[00:18:04] you just need to keep chipping away at
[00:18:06] enemy stand user 6799 asks I need to
[00:18:10] study more per day but I can't since my
[00:18:12] brain shuts off how do I deal with
[00:18:14] exhaustion and mental fatigue you can do
[00:18:17] 2 hours of focused high quality work
[00:18:20] that is
[00:18:21] legitimately better than 20 hours that
[00:18:25] is at a lower quality and less Focus
[00:18:27] what used to take me
[00:18:29] let's say a 100 hours in high school for
[00:18:32] me to learn now I could learn the exact
[00:18:35] same thing probably even better in 5
[00:18:40] hours and I'm absolutely not
[00:18:41] exaggerating when I say that so when we
[00:18:43] think about why you are exhausted and
[00:18:45] fatigued is it because you are basically
[00:18:48] burning out from doing something that's
[00:18:51] ineffective and tiring for a long period
[00:18:53] of time or is it because you are doing
[00:18:55] the right thing and you're doing it in a
[00:18:57] really focused good way but you're just
[00:18:58] doing it so much that it's just draining
[00:19:01] if it's the ladder and you are really
[00:19:04] doing high quality work then you can
[00:19:06] probably afford to just take it easy a
[00:19:08] little bit you're probably miles ahead
[00:19:11] if it's the former which is definitely
[00:19:12] more common and you're doing more
[00:19:14] passive work that takes a long time and
[00:19:16] it just makes you feel tired then
[00:19:18] counterintuitively the way that you'd
[00:19:20] combat that is to spend more effort
[00:19:22] during the session to try to make it at
[00:19:25] a higher quality which actually
[00:19:27] activates your brain more engages it
[00:19:29] makes you feel more energized and it
[00:19:31] means that you don't have to spend so
[00:19:32] much time to cover the same amount of
[00:19:34] content Alice carollyn 7254 asks how do
[00:19:37] I consistently study every day like I
[00:19:40] said before with distractions it's very
[00:19:42] hard to solve a problem you can't see
[00:19:44] the first thing is to start reflecting
[00:19:46] and observing why you're not able to
[00:19:48] study consistently every day what is the
[00:19:50] thing that's actually holding you back
[00:19:52] is it a certain way that it makes you
[00:19:53] feel is it because it's not effective uh
[00:19:55] and therefore it's demotivating do you
[00:19:56] feel daunted are you procrastinating
[00:19:58] there are many reasons that can stop you
[00:20:00] and each reason has a different root
[00:20:04] cause that can be addressed in a
[00:20:05] different way Clara Hall 16 how do I
[00:20:08] maximize my learning for audio/video
[00:20:11] lectures since I can't Prime beforehand
[00:20:14] I love this question because clar Hall
[00:20:18] is obviously thinking about priming
[00:20:20] which is like one of the best things
[00:20:22] that you can do for your learning it
[00:20:24] helps it build basic connections and
[00:20:27] preps it so that the information it
[00:20:29] receives later is easier to process and
[00:20:31] in the case of like live lectures it
[00:20:33] makes those lectures so much less
[00:20:35] overwhelming cuz your brain is ready for
[00:20:37] what it's about to hear clar H is asking
[00:20:40] about sort of pre-recorded videos and
[00:20:43] audio resources what you can actually do
[00:20:45] is just download it and then just run it
[00:20:49] through Ai and just tell it to give you
[00:20:52] a summary of what it's talking about and
[00:20:54] you can use that to Prime yourself
[00:20:56] before you listen to it if you can't
[00:20:58] download download it then another
[00:20:59] strategy is to familiarize yourself with
[00:21:02] the learning objectives first and then
[00:21:05] listen to it very very quickly just
[00:21:07] picking out for anything that you think
[00:21:10] is unique or new that you wouldn't be
[00:21:12] able to get from other resources which
[00:21:14] it usually provided to you so for
[00:21:16] example when I was doing my masters of
[00:21:17] education there was this enormous
[00:21:19] textbook for me to read through and I
[00:21:21] knew the learning objectives for every
[00:21:22] single lecture cuz it was it was written
[00:21:24] it's almost always available so I would
[00:21:27] look through the learning objectives
[00:21:30] scan through the lecture to see if
[00:21:31] there's anything I think I wouldn't
[00:21:33] learn from just a textbook make a note
[00:21:35] of that and then I'd go and do most of
[00:21:37] my learning through the textbook using
[00:21:39] the learning objectives as a gopost and
[00:21:42] then I would come back to the parts that
[00:21:43] I marked on the lecture to just fill in
[00:21:45] the gaps question by F Ben Parkins 361
[00:21:50] do you have any advice for multiple
[00:21:52] choice
[00:21:53] exams I have a lot of advice for
[00:21:55] multiple choice exams my best piece of
[00:21:56] advice is just know the material really
[00:22:00] well it's just a test of your knowledge
[00:22:03] so depending on how you perform in this
[00:22:05] test you're either going to see that
[00:22:07] there are things to work on in your
[00:22:08] knowledge or the way that you apply your
[00:22:10] knowledge and depending on where the
[00:22:11] issue is the solution is very different
[00:22:14] Blaster
[00:22:15] shies TM asks what are some habits that
[00:22:19] can improve one's memory memory is the
[00:22:22] product of thought when you think in a
[00:22:26] certain way memory is the byproduct
[00:22:29] habits to improve your memory are the
[00:22:31] habits that allow more effective
[00:22:34] thinking any technique or tip that makes
[00:22:37] you think more about what you're
[00:22:39] learning that makes you evaluate the
[00:22:42] importance of what you're learning and
[00:22:44] connect compare see how different
[00:22:46] concepts and different parts of what
[00:22:47] you're learning influence each other
[00:22:50] anything that makes you focus on the big
[00:22:51] picture of what you're learning will
[00:22:54] likely improve your memory Mel Marcelo
[00:23:00] Ru 6513 I'm so sorry about how I
[00:23:03] pronounced your name asks how would you
[00:23:06] advise me to take notes during class if
[00:23:08] I don't have an iPad and only have a
[00:23:11] pencil and paper they don't allow us to
[00:23:13] record the class that's unfortunate but
[00:23:16] don't worry when I was first starting
[00:23:18] with nonline not taking and mindmapping
[00:23:20] not only did I not have an iPad because
[00:23:22] iPads were and still are very expensive
[00:23:25] uh I actually started off using leftover
[00:23:28] A3 rice paper that I just happened to
[00:23:31] have lying around at home and I that's
[00:23:33] like the most Asian thing I can say but
[00:23:36] I don't know why I guess I also thought
[00:23:39] buying just A3 or A2 paper was too
[00:23:43] expensive and so I actually found I
[00:23:45] think it's like wrapping paper that we
[00:23:47] just had lying around at home and I
[00:23:48] would do my mind maps on that one
[00:23:50] strategy that my uh students actually
[00:23:52] started thinking of is they would buy
[00:23:54] art books which usually have A3 or A2
[00:23:57] size paper
[00:23:59] and they would either carry that around
[00:24:00] with them or they would cut it so they
[00:24:01] have a piece that they can do all their
[00:24:04] mind mapping on and they'd fold it up
[00:24:05] and put it into a clear file and carry
[00:24:07] that around with them I think that's
[00:24:09] perfectly fine just make sure you don't
[00:24:11] run into the surprisingly common mistake
[00:24:13] of just because your paper is bigger
[00:24:16] doesn't mean you should write bigger or
[00:24:18] start using like permanent markers
[00:24:21] instead the point of the paper being
[00:24:24] bigger is so that you have more space to
[00:24:25] write there's no point anymore if you
[00:24:28] right larger as well
[00:24:30] motivator asks what are the
[00:24:33] characteristics of a good study system a
[00:24:35] good study system should always have
[00:24:36] some form of priming or pre-study to
[00:24:39] prep your brain to receive the
[00:24:40] information and to form basic structures
[00:24:43] it should have some method of processing
[00:24:45] the information during your main
[00:24:47] intensive learning event it should allow
[00:24:49] you to process the information in a way
[00:24:51] that helps you categorize it make sense
[00:24:52] of it compare ideas contrast ideas see
[00:24:55] the big picture if you've done this
[00:24:57] correctly at the point you should have
[00:25:00] gaps in your ability to recall details
[00:25:02] and have memorized things you should not
[00:25:05] be trying to do that in the early stages
[00:25:07] of learning you should also have a
[00:25:09] review of that material where you can
[00:25:11] elaborate on it flesh out the
[00:25:13] relationships and add additional
[00:25:14] material from other resources within
[00:25:18] probably 24 hours preferably on the same
[00:25:21] day before you go to sleep and there
[00:25:22] should also be some form of varied
[00:25:25] challenging testing from memory testing
[00:25:29] it at the levels that you will need
[00:25:31] eventually within the first week and
[00:25:34] then again sometime two to 4 weeks later
[00:25:37] if you need to memorize things you
[00:25:38] should also have a usually flash cards
[00:25:41] is a great technique to use for this
[00:25:43] something that's running in parallel for
[00:25:45] those little details that you need to
[00:25:46] memorize but importantly those flash
[00:25:48] cards need to be a last resort only the
[00:25:50] things that you can't integrate and
[00:25:53] connect together should go into your
[00:25:54] flash cards the more flash cards you
[00:25:56] have the more burden you give your
[00:25:58] future self and eventually you have no
[00:26:00] time to do anything because you have so
[00:26:01] many flash cards to do but that is a
[00:26:02] very generic answer and at the end of
[00:26:05] the day a good study system is just what
[00:26:06] works for you and your circumstance but
[00:26:08] generally speaking you want to try to
[00:26:11] hit as many of those boxes as possible
[00:26:13] SAR Shala asks how to learn multiple
[00:26:17] subjects at the same time EG two
[00:26:19] subjects spread out across two weeks
[00:26:21] whether you choose to focus on just one
[00:26:23] subject and then try to do as much as
[00:26:25] you can on that one and then swap to
[00:26:27] another one versus if you just decide to
[00:26:29] just split your time 50/50 every single
[00:26:31] day on on both subjects it doesn't
[00:26:35] really matter there's not going to be a
[00:26:36] significant difference between the two
[00:26:38] of those in in fact some would argue
[00:26:40] that just splitting your time uh between
[00:26:42] two different subjects would be better
[00:26:44] because it activates more inter leaving
[00:26:46] but what matters the most is how you can
[00:26:48] use your study system if you split your
[00:26:50] time evenly across two subjects but then
[00:26:52] it makes it really hard to use that
[00:26:54] study system that I just explained
[00:26:55] before then that's going to be the thing
[00:26:57] that is
[00:26:58] holding you back the most so whether you
[00:27:00] study one thing at a time or two or
[00:27:02] three or four or five things at a time
[00:27:04] just the most important thing is to keep
[00:27:05] your study system functional AI sf1 hour
[00:27:10] asks how do you make mind maps for maths
[00:27:13] and physics I think a lot of math and
[00:27:15] physics is taught in a way that's overly
[00:27:18] procedural in that there's a lot of
[00:27:20] focus on just solving problems and
[00:27:22] there's less focus on understanding the
[00:27:24] concepts behind what you're actually
[00:27:26] learning and as a result you get people
[00:27:29] who can solve problems when they're
[00:27:30] given to them in like a very specific
[00:27:32] format but when it's complicated
[00:27:34] problems that require you to actually
[00:27:36] figure out the approach and piece things
[00:27:38] together or it's a contextualized
[00:27:41] problem that it's not like it's you know
[00:27:43] not just numbers and it's actual words
[00:27:45] and scenarios that you have to decipher
[00:27:47] people struggle a lot and so the
[00:27:49] strategy for making mind maps for a
[00:27:52] subject like math or physics is actually
[00:27:54] exactly the same as you would for
[00:27:57] economics or history or biology or
[00:27:59] chemistry like it's exactly the same the
[00:28:02] hardest part is actually just seeing the
[00:28:05] topic in that way and realizing you can
[00:28:08] just think about it in the same
[00:28:10] conceptual way it just doesn't feel
[00:28:12] natural sometimes because it's presented
[00:28:14] to us in a way that's very procedural
[00:28:17] heavy Silver Mist Bell asked what are
[00:28:20] your thoughts on Parkinson's law
[00:28:22] Parkinson's law is the idea that a task
[00:28:25] will fill whatever space you give it so
[00:28:28] if you have an assignment during 3 weeks
[00:28:30] but you give yourself 3 hours you will
[00:28:32] get it done but if you give yourself 3
[00:28:34] weeks it will take 3 weeks it expands or
[00:28:37] contracts to fill the space that you
[00:28:39] give it I love Parkinson's law because
[00:28:42] it just illustrates perfectly that time
[00:28:46] passing is a terrible way to measure
[00:28:49] things how long you spend studying
[00:28:52] really doesn't matter I try to use
[00:28:54] Parkinson's law all the time uh the only
[00:28:56] thing that I recommend is that you don't
[00:28:58] use Parkinson's law by just cramming
[00:29:01] everything in last minute there's
[00:29:03] nothing wrong with trying to do 3 weeks
[00:29:05] of work in 3 days if you can do it but
[00:29:08] just avoid the risk that you might get
[00:29:11] to the end of day three and realize you
[00:29:13] don't have enough time or you don't have
[00:29:15] enough time to like check your gaps or
[00:29:17] test yourself and give yourself the best
[00:29:19] chance at success if it's something that
[00:29:21] actually matters to you yes crab use
[00:29:25] Parkinson's law but just do it up front
[00:29:27] when I did my masters of education I
[00:29:29] decided to finish the entire Year's
[00:29:30] curriculum within that first month part
[00:29:32] of that was to just see if I could which
[00:29:34] I was able to do quite successfully and
[00:29:36] the other part is because I was also
[00:29:38] working like double full-time hours as
[00:29:40] well but because I did it all up front
[00:29:42] it meant that I did have time here and
[00:29:43] there throughout the year just to keep
[00:29:45] on top of things to test myself and just
[00:29:47] get those tiny little incremental gains
[00:29:50] that made me go from a 95% to a 100% if
[00:29:52] it matters the one who must not be named
[00:29:56] asks how do you catch up and get back on
[00:29:58] track after weeks of poor commitment
[00:30:01] from a student who's currently facing a
[00:30:02] highly competitive University entrance
[00:30:05] exam this really depends on how far back
[00:30:09] you are and how close your exam is let's
[00:30:14] look at a statement of reality at a
[00:30:17] certain point it's too little too late
[00:30:21] if you're behind on an entire semester
[00:30:23] of work and your exam is
[00:30:26] tomorrow and you're trying to get like
[00:30:28] an
[00:30:29] A+ unless your deep processing is just
[00:30:33] astronomically high now that's obviously
[00:30:35] a spectrum even if you have two weeks
[00:30:37] left it might not be enough even if you
[00:30:39] have a month left depending on the
[00:30:41] content and how far behind in the exam
[00:30:42] it might not be enough and the reason
[00:30:44] that I'm mentioning this is because it's
[00:30:47] really important to recognize if you've
[00:30:49] made a mistake in your preparation for
[00:30:52] an exam that's about to come up and you
[00:30:54] think there's a real risk that you might
[00:30:57] not get the result that you want you
[00:30:59] have to think about how you're going to
[00:31:01] avoid that mistake next time I worked
[00:31:03] for years in the premedical space
[00:31:06] helping students enter into medical
[00:31:07] school and it was a really interesting
[00:31:10] experience because I also worked it was
[00:31:12] a charity and I worked with a lot of
[00:31:14] students from like academically
[00:31:16] disadvantaged backgrounds um often from
[00:31:18] poorer schools and they didn't have a
[00:31:22] lot of these study habits and prior
[00:31:25] experience with these subjects so when
[00:31:27] they entered into uni it was like a
[00:31:30] shock to them they really really
[00:31:31] struggled to adapt that's actually the
[00:31:33] reason why I started learning coaching
[00:31:34] is because I wanted to see can I teach
[00:31:36] these students what I've learned after
[00:31:38] years of University but when they're
[00:31:40] still in high school and one of the most
[00:31:43] heart-sinking things that I would see
[00:31:45] all the time is people get to the end of
[00:31:47] the year they don't enter into medical
[00:31:48] school because they made a bunch of
[00:31:50] mistakes sure but then they don't
[00:31:53] actually do anything to fix those so
[00:31:55] they enter into their second year of
[00:31:56] University trying to in through a
[00:31:58] graduate pathway but they make like they
[00:32:00] haven't changed anything they've just
[00:32:02] gone from one year to another year like
[00:32:04] time has passed and nothing has changed
[00:32:06] so they make the exact same mistakes and
[00:32:07] they miss their second shot as well so
[00:32:09] for starters use this as a wakeup call
[00:32:12] to be like okay I got to like get myself
[00:32:14] together what is stopping me from being
[00:32:16] a successful student figure it out and
[00:32:18] actually invest time effort like part of
[00:32:20] yourself into fixing that if that is
[00:32:23] important to you and if you are really
[00:32:25] close to the exam and you feel like
[00:32:26] you're screwed and if there's only one
[00:32:29] thing that you can do then the first and
[00:32:32] only strategy that I'd recommend that
[00:32:33] you just heavily invest in is just
[00:32:35] testing just test yourself even if you
[00:32:37] don't even know the topic even if you
[00:32:39] don't know the knowledge just learn it
[00:32:42] while you're testing just test test test
[00:32:45] if we think about a single technique
[00:32:47] that's probably going to fill that Gap
[00:32:49] as effectively as possible in the
[00:32:50] shortest period of time testing is
[00:32:52] probably where it's at Barnabas 4608
[00:32:55] asks after failing an exam how should I
[00:32:58] analyze my past preparation to better
[00:33:01] learn from my mistakes I did not plan
[00:33:03] the order I'm reading these questions
[00:33:05] for the first time such a timely and
[00:33:08] good question how do you actually learn
[00:33:10] from the mistake so again it's very
[00:33:12] difficult to solve something when you
[00:33:13] can't see the problem figure out what
[00:33:15] the mistakes are first if you don't get
[00:33:18] an outcome that you want failing to get
[00:33:20] the outcome was not the mistake that's
[00:33:22] the symptom of the mistake the mistake
[00:33:24] was somewhere before the outcome and
[00:33:27] there may be multiple different mistakes
[00:33:29] be very specific about understanding
[00:33:32] what are the things that you think held
[00:33:34] you back and there are two ways that I
[00:33:35] want you to think about this the first
[00:33:37] is process what are the things you did
[00:33:40] that you shouldn't have done what are
[00:33:41] the things you didn't do that you should
[00:33:43] have done but the second often more
[00:33:46] important more powerful change that you
[00:33:48] can make is how did you make decisions
[00:33:51] and react often when people are learning
[00:33:53] to learn the new techniques feel
[00:33:55] uncomfortable very common mistake akake
[00:33:58] as a behavior and decisionmaking method
[00:34:01] is that when they try this new technique
[00:34:03] and it feels uncomfortable and it feels
[00:34:04] a little difficult they actually revert
[00:34:07] back to what they're comfortable with
[00:34:08] and they say oh this new technique
[00:34:09] doesn't work this is actually a well
[00:34:12] studied phenomenon in learning science
[00:34:14] and it's considered one of the biggest
[00:34:16] reasons why students fail to become
[00:34:18] successful so write down everything that
[00:34:20] you did as part of your preparation and
[00:34:22] then write down next to it why did you
[00:34:24] do that and then go through how did it
[00:34:26] go when something went wrong or not too
[00:34:29] plann how did I respond to that how did
[00:34:32] I feel about it how did I react and what
[00:34:34] decisions did I make from that and look
[00:34:36] there if there are problems problems in
[00:34:38] your decision making or the way that you
[00:34:40] react to things are likely transferable
[00:34:43] solving that solves 20 other things AI
[00:34:47] boy Muhammad
[00:34:49] 6079 I think I screwed up the name again
[00:34:51] but uh what is the difference between
[00:34:53] Bloom's taxonomy and solo taxonomy what
[00:34:55] a technical question I love it both
[00:34:57] blooms and solo taxonomy are ways that
[00:35:00] people have tried to categorize
[00:35:02] knowledge in the past and there is a lot
[00:35:05] of overlap between them but first of all
[00:35:07] blooms divides it into six different
[00:35:09] categories actually the original Bloom
[00:35:11] which was published in the 70s uh is not
[00:35:13] really used anymore and the one that
[00:35:15] most people talk about now is Bloom's
[00:35:16] revised taxonomy which was revised in
[00:35:17] the early 2000s for those of you who
[00:35:19] care which is probably none of you uh
[00:35:21] but solo tonomy divides it into five
[00:35:23] levels instead of six but the big
[00:35:25] difference is actually that solo
[00:35:27] taxonomy divides the knowledge into what
[00:35:29] the knowledge schema looks like once you
[00:35:33] have learned it whereas blooms taxonomy
[00:35:36] focuses on how you go about arriving at
[00:35:42] those schemas it's about what are the
[00:35:44] thought processes that are engaged for
[00:35:47] example like memorize is a verb like
[00:35:50] when you try to memorize you reach this
[00:35:52] level when you try to understand you
[00:35:54] reach this level whereas solo taxonomy
[00:35:56] just says what what is the level that's
[00:35:59] reached arom Mano Nick asks how do you
[00:36:03] best approach learning for work compared
[00:36:04] to learning for school the way you learn
[00:36:07] for work or school when you learn
[00:36:11] effectively is very very similar almost
[00:36:14] exactly the same in reality most
[00:36:18] professionals as soon as they start
[00:36:19] learning for work realize that many of
[00:36:22] the methods they used in school no
[00:36:23] longer work for them and then they kind
[00:36:25] of develop a whole new method of
[00:36:28] learning just for work here's the
[00:36:31] interesting thing often when we talk to
[00:36:33] professionals and then I ask them if you
[00:36:36] went imagine going back to UNI with what
[00:36:38] You' have learned about how to learn now
[00:36:41] with your experience with work how would
[00:36:43] you do and they often say man I would
[00:36:44] have found it so much easier because now
[00:36:46] I know how my brain works they know how
[00:36:49] to like piece things together they can
[00:36:50] make things more relevant all that
[00:36:53] happened is that the professional
[00:36:55] learned how to learn a little bit more
[00:36:58] effectively a little bit more in tune
[00:37:00] with how their brain actually wants to
[00:37:01] learn whereas in academics you can just
[00:37:04] get away with not really needing those
[00:37:08] strategies as much you can kind of
[00:37:09] scrape by or you can actually sometimes
[00:37:12] just game the system so the principles
[00:37:14] that I teach in all my videos and in my
[00:37:16] program they are almost exactly the same
[00:37:19] for Learning and for work I use it every
[00:37:23] day anytime I need to learn anything for
[00:37:24] work I teach it to CEOs managers new
[00:37:27] graduates Associates because it's based
[00:37:29] on how biologically your brain likes to
[00:37:33] take in information and process it
[00:37:35] having said that there are some Nuance
[00:37:37] details like for example a lot of
[00:37:39] professionals like they don't need flash
[00:37:40] cards that's memorization is not a
[00:37:42] technique that they need in in some
[00:37:44] instances so there are some small
[00:37:46] differences between the two Hari Jerry
[00:37:48] asks how do you memorize and retain lots
[00:37:50] of facts years formulas names places I
[00:37:54] keep forgetting them after a week well
[00:37:56] Harry Jerry
[00:37:58] uh based on the research you are just
[00:38:01] like every other student um it's very
[00:38:03] normal to forget them after a week
[00:38:06] generally people think that they will
[00:38:08] retain information at about 70% after a
[00:38:11] week but when you actually test them
[00:38:13] it's only like 30 to 50% so forgetting
[00:38:16] most of what you learn after a week is
[00:38:18] actually the norm just because you feel
[00:38:20] like you have tried to memorize it and
[00:38:22] that you have understood it at the time
[00:38:25] doesn't mean you will retain that
[00:38:26] knowledge or that you can use it the
[00:38:28] thing that determines whether that
[00:38:29] knowledge will stay encoded into your
[00:38:32] memory or not is how connected that
[00:38:35] information is and how integrated it is
[00:38:38] with other pieces of information this is
[00:38:40] the Crux of learning information in
[00:38:44] isolation is death that information will
[00:38:47] not survive inside your memory it will
[00:38:48] be purged out and the only way you can
[00:38:51] take information that is actively being
[00:38:54] purged out because it's irrelevant
[00:38:55] doesn't connect with anything there's no
[00:38:56] reason for you brain to keep this it's
[00:38:58] not connected to anything is if you just
[00:39:00] repeatedly slam it into your brain
[00:39:02] through repetition uh some people call
[00:39:04] this deepening the neural Groove and it
[00:39:07] does actually work but it's limited in
[00:39:10] its effect because it's number one
[00:39:12] requiring a lot of repetition which
[00:39:14] means lots of time and it's not scalable
[00:39:17] if most of what you learn you have to do
[00:39:20] through brute force and repetition then
[00:39:22] you're not going to have time to repeat
[00:39:25] all of that stuff so the trick is figure
[00:39:27] out the things that you can connect make
[00:39:29] sense of information more connect it
[00:39:31] together and the stuff that you can't
[00:39:34] Chuck it through flash card use brute
[00:39:36] force thanks for watching and if you
[00:39:38] want me to answer more questions then
[00:39:39] let me know in the comments Below in the
[00:39:40] meantime watch this other video that

=== 13 Years of No BS Productivity Advice in 67 Minutes ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-aEFft14VI

[00:00:00] I've been a learning coach for the past
[00:00:01] 13 years during this time I've been able
[00:00:04] to complete medical school as well as
[00:00:06] work as a doctor and complete my masters
[00:00:08] while running two businesses full-time I
[00:00:11] now run a learning program at I can
[00:00:13] study where I have coached tens of
[00:00:15] thousands of people with these same
[00:00:17] methods to Triple their productivity and
[00:00:20] today I'm going to compress 13 years of
[00:00:23] NOS productivity advice into this one
[00:00:27] video number one don't trust your your
[00:00:30] brain this is probably the most
[00:00:32] important thing to help you do more
[00:00:36] while working less I had this classmate
[00:00:40] back in medical school her name was
[00:00:41] Hannah and throughout medical school she
[00:00:44] was this very
[00:00:45] hardworking super diligent like role
[00:00:48] model student and so I was really
[00:00:50] surprised when recently she reached out
[00:00:53] to me for a consultation and she said
[00:00:56] that she'd been struggling for years
[00:00:59] because because she felt like she was
[00:01:02] always busy she had just bought a house
[00:01:04] and she was trying to start a family and
[00:01:06] she was trying to enter you know into
[00:01:08] this very very competitive surgical
[00:01:09] training program and there were all
[00:01:11] these pressures and all these different
[00:01:12] goals and she felt she was getting
[00:01:14] further and further from being able to
[00:01:15] achieve them while being so busy that
[00:01:18] she had no more time to spare so I said
[00:01:20] what are you doing to be more productive
[00:01:24] and she was doing a lot of good things
[00:01:26] like she was making schedules she was
[00:01:28] making to-do list she was prioritizing
[00:01:29] her tasks very important so what was the
[00:01:32] problem the problem was that she trusted
[00:01:35] her brain too much she trusted that when
[00:01:39] she makes a plan her brain will follow
[00:01:41] through on that she trusted that when
[00:01:44] there's a schedule her brain will follow
[00:01:46] it that when there is a priority that
[00:01:48] her brain will stick to it and not get
[00:01:49] distracted and the important thing that
[00:01:52] she had to realize is that your brain is
[00:01:54] not there to help you reach your
[00:01:57] productivity goals your brain is just
[00:02:00] there to keep you alive it's always
[00:02:01] looking for the energy efficient
[00:02:03] shortcut which your plans probably
[00:02:07] aren't your plans probably aren't easy
[00:02:09] they require hard work and consistency
[00:02:12] so you have to expect that if you're
[00:02:15] trying to be productive that that is not
[00:02:18] going to be
[00:02:19] natural your brain is going to make
[00:02:22] errors and for Hannah she expected and
[00:02:27] trusted that her brain will be able to
[00:02:30] perform perfectly every single day and
[00:02:33] so you should have this week or two of
[00:02:35] like blistering productivity
[00:02:38] everything's going great and then
[00:02:40] something happens and she' beat herself
[00:02:42] up over it and should say like yet again
[00:02:45] this what she said is like I keep trying
[00:02:47] and trying and every time I try I keep
[00:02:49] failing and the reason why this is such
[00:02:51] an important one to start with is that
[00:02:52] it forces your perspective on other
[00:02:56] things that might help your brain to
[00:02:59] perform a a little bit better so for
[00:03:01] example Hannah she never scheduled
[00:03:04] breaks for herself because there was so
[00:03:07] much she wanted to do and there was
[00:03:09] never enough time why would she take
[00:03:11] time off and as a result she was getting
[00:03:15] burnt out well guess what being burnt
[00:03:18] out is very
[00:03:20] unproductive so what I want to really
[00:03:23] help redefine and like if you take
[00:03:25] nothing away from this video other than
[00:03:28] this one message I think this is the one
[00:03:29] that makes it biggest difference is that
[00:03:32] productivity is not about being busy
[00:03:36] productivity is anything that gets you
[00:03:39] closer to your
[00:03:42] goals anything and any goal your goal
[00:03:46] could be
[00:03:47] to live in isolation in the mountains
[00:03:50] like a Hermit totally fine I wish I
[00:03:54] could have such a goal cuz that sounds
[00:03:56] awesome if that's your goal then the
[00:03:58] things you do that get you closer to
[00:04:00] that goal that's productivity
[00:04:02] productivity is not about like being
[00:04:05] busy having 50 different apps of fully
[00:04:07] filled calendar that's not what
[00:04:09] productivity is in fact a lot of those
[00:04:10] things can take away from productivity
[00:04:13] productivity is understanding what you
[00:04:16] need when you need it that gets you
[00:04:19] towards your goal and then committing to
[00:04:21] that action and sometimes that means
[00:04:23] getting more sleep that means taking a
[00:04:25] break that means reflecting spending
[00:04:27] time with your loved ones not working
[00:04:30] over a certain holiday and this is a
[00:04:32] this was a tough pill for me to swallow
[00:04:34] for myself cuz I'm kind of like a
[00:04:36] workaholic that's what true productivity
[00:04:38] is that's what allows you to have the
[00:04:40] longevity and the sustainability of just
[00:04:43] being able to day in and day out just do
[00:04:46] what you need to do for so long that you
[00:04:49] inevitably reach your goals and by
[00:04:52] starting off not trusting our brain to
[00:04:54] be a perfect executor we switch from
[00:04:57] being on the back foot reacting to
[00:04:59] problems and errors and obstacles that
[00:05:02] come up because our brain wasn't perfect
[00:05:05] and we start thinking proactively okay
[00:05:07] what are the barriers what are the
[00:05:09] challenges I may face with following
[00:05:11] this plan with following this schedule
[00:05:14] realistically for my
[00:05:16] brain where is it going to struggle and
[00:05:18] where are where is it going to make
[00:05:20] mistakes let's plan for that and
[00:05:22] immediately that reduces the amount of
[00:05:25] just stress and burden on a daily basis
[00:05:30] of trying to be productive and I truly
[00:05:32] believe that you cannot have sustained
[00:05:37] productivity without sustained
[00:05:40] self-compassion number two start small
[00:05:44] then nuclear once we start thinking
[00:05:47] about productivity and reaching our
[00:05:49] goals in a more sustainable way we start
[00:05:51] realizing that there are really a lot of
[00:05:53] things that we can start doing to
[00:05:55] improve our productivity and give our
[00:05:57] brain a better chance and so the real
[00:05:59] question question is where do you start
[00:06:02] anytime there's any error or issue with
[00:06:06] your productivity whether it's your
[00:06:07] scheduling or your task management or
[00:06:09] your prioritization or your
[00:06:11] distractability or procrastinating
[00:06:13] whatever it is start with the thing that
[00:06:16] you feel is easy and obvious to fix
[00:06:19] where you have a pretty high certainty
[00:06:22] that doing this is going to help you and
[00:06:24] it doesn't really matter if it's the
[00:06:25] most important thing to start with just
[00:06:28] start with the ones that you feel
[00:06:29] confident to lock in because if there
[00:06:31] are a 100 things you need to work on the
[00:06:34] best position for you to be in is to
[00:06:36] then have 99 in my first few years of
[00:06:39] University I used to experiment with
[00:06:43] like everything all at once like I was
[00:06:46] using different schedules different
[00:06:48] sleep schedules different task
[00:06:50] management apps I used I actually had a
[00:06:52] period of time where I was using like
[00:06:53] three or four different task management
[00:06:55] apps at the same time to see which one
[00:06:58] was better
[00:07:00] and the result was I wasted a lot of
[00:07:03] time
[00:07:05] unnecessarily the better approach is
[00:07:08] just lock in on one thing that you think
[00:07:11] you can get better at fix that thing and
[00:07:14] then move on to the next thing it just
[00:07:16] you're immediately getting the value of
[00:07:18] having one less problem and it means
[00:07:21] that it's easier to think about the next
[00:07:23] problem if you try to fix all 100 things
[00:07:25] at the same time you're guaranteed to
[00:07:28] fix none of them so what does new
[00:07:29] nuclear mean nuclear means that if you
[00:07:31] weren't able to solve a problem by using
[00:07:33] the small strategies don't like just
[00:07:36] keep fluffing around with like more
[00:07:38] little things that may or may not work
[00:07:40] just throw the whole truck at it most
[00:07:42] common example for this is
[00:07:43] procrastination and distractions you
[00:07:45] might say hey I can install an app
[00:07:47] blocker and that might stop me from Doom
[00:07:49] scrolling on Instagram and that's my
[00:07:52] like small immediate thing great give it
[00:07:55] a go start small let's say you do that
[00:07:58] and it doesn't work you're still getting
[00:07:59] distracted you found a way around your
[00:08:00] app Locker don't just keep piling on
[00:08:04] tiny little things that may or may not
[00:08:06] make a difference if you failed on that
[00:08:08] one then it means that the problem is
[00:08:09] bigger than that right it means that
[00:08:11] there's like a strong habit there's a
[00:08:13] strong force there that's bringing you
[00:08:14] back to that problem just throw the
[00:08:16] whole truck at it delete the app on your
[00:08:20] phone completely block it on your
[00:08:21] computer so that you can't access it do
[00:08:23] absolutely everything that you can to
[00:08:25] just eradicate it and then just see how
[00:08:28] that works the reason say this is
[00:08:30] because it is much easier to go nuclear
[00:08:33] than scale back down to something that's
[00:08:36] more realistic than it is to figure out
[00:08:39] where that realistic point is through
[00:08:41] these tiny little steps one by one where
[00:08:44] it's very very frustrating it's very
[00:08:46] demotivating and you like never know
[00:08:48] whether you're going to reach it if you
[00:08:49] start nuclear the problem's gone done
[00:08:51] it's solved now you can slowly start
[00:08:53] reintroducing things bringing it back
[00:08:56] down to figure out where that line is
[00:08:58] don't let problem s linger for months or
[00:09:02] even years when you could just crush
[00:09:05] them in a week when I was a doctor one
[00:09:07] of the really interesting things about
[00:09:08] working in a healthcare system in New
[00:09:11] Zealand it's it's a public Healthcare
[00:09:13] System so we're always very wary about
[00:09:17] resource usage like you can't just have
[00:09:21] a patient come into the emergency room
[00:09:23] and you just give them like every single
[00:09:25] scan and blood test that you know that's
[00:09:28] available to you like that's tens of
[00:09:29] thousands hundreds of thousands of
[00:09:31] dollars of Investigations that we're
[00:09:33] doing which may not be necessary and so
[00:09:36] the idea is that you focus on where you
[00:09:39] think it's going to provide you the most
[00:09:41] value so let's say someone comes in with
[00:09:43] like a sore leg okay cool we're going to
[00:09:44] do an exray of the leg like that becomes
[00:09:47] the best thing to do now because that's
[00:09:50] probably the thing that provides us the
[00:09:52] most information and most value to make
[00:09:55] a diagnosis and treat this person and if
[00:09:57] that's not enough then we think about it
[00:09:58] like okay well what's the next thing and
[00:10:00] so this is called su's law which was
[00:10:02] named after this guy called William suon
[00:10:05] who like 100 years ago was a train
[00:10:10] robber and he robbed this train which
[00:10:13] was full of gold and they asked him hey
[00:10:16] why did you rob this train and he said
[00:10:19] because that's where the money is at and
[00:10:21] so s's law became go for where the money
[00:10:24] is at and I'm not talking about money in
[00:10:26] terms of like cash money I'm talking
[00:10:29] about go for the money in terms of where
[00:10:31] the value is in productivity remember I
[00:10:35] how I said that I used to use like four
[00:10:36] different task management apps at the
[00:10:38] same time to figure out which one was
[00:10:39] best that's not where the main value was
[00:10:43] at thinking back on it now the biggest
[00:10:45] thing for me would have been how do I
[00:10:47] just reduce my procrastination and if I
[00:10:49] think about how much of my time and
[00:10:51] effort and energy on figuring out
[00:10:53] productivity was spent on that removing
[00:10:57] procrastination I would say
[00:10:59] very very little like less than 10% of
[00:11:02] my effort and attention was directed at
[00:11:05] that even though that's for me the
[00:11:07] biggest bottleneck that would have been
[00:11:09] where the money is at and so what I
[00:11:11] often find when I'm coaching people is
[00:11:13] that usually there may be a hundred
[00:11:16] different things that you could work on
[00:11:18] but there's only like one or two things
[00:11:20] that if you were to solve those you
[00:11:23] could double your productivity off the
[00:11:25] bat and they're usually big sticky
[00:11:28] problems that you don't know how to
[00:11:29] handle but that just means that it's
[00:11:31] important to start trying to solve them
[00:11:33] as early as you can cuz it's going to
[00:11:35] take time and be very careful about
[00:11:38] getting really excited about things that
[00:11:41] feel like it's going to be really
[00:11:43] helpful for your productivity but it's
[00:11:45] not where the money is at like I used to
[00:11:47] go and open up the app store and like
[00:11:48] scroll through different productivity
[00:11:50] apps to see what new productivity app is
[00:11:54] on the App Store that might just
[00:11:56] magically solve my problem it's just
[00:11:58] it's not going to happen like and I've
[00:12:00] been doing this for a long enough time
[00:12:01] to know that's just not how it works
[00:12:04] that app is not going to solve it that
[00:12:05] app is a distraction that app and that
[00:12:09] behavior of you trying to look for the
[00:12:11] easy solution that feels exciting is the
[00:12:14] thing that stopping you from being more
[00:12:16] productive so figure out what's holding
[00:12:18] you back the most that's where the value
[00:12:20] is focus there number four do more with
[00:12:24] less when you start thinking about where
[00:12:26] the value really is for improving your
[00:12:28] product ity you start realizing that a
[00:12:31] lot of solutions are actually just more
[00:12:33] problems and the common example here is
[00:12:36] when people use a lot of different apps
[00:12:38] and a lot of different Frameworks and a
[00:12:39] lot of different like different types of
[00:12:42] kind of solutions like they'll download
[00:12:43] a template from here and they'll have
[00:12:45] this app for this and this app for this
[00:12:47] and I'm not saying that you shouldn't
[00:12:48] use apps but try to do as much as you
[00:12:51] can with as little as you can I have
[00:12:54] gone from using four different task
[00:12:56] management apps three different calendar
[00:12:59] apps one for my phone one for my laptop
[00:13:01] and then one for my tablet because each
[00:13:03] app performs slightly differently across
[00:13:05] the three I've gone from that to now I
[00:13:08] have a task management app I have a
[00:13:11] notebook like a
[00:13:13] literal just sitting on my desk like you
[00:13:16] know that just has me writing on it with
[00:13:18] a with an actual pen uh I use Google
[00:13:21] Calendar and that's basically it that's
[00:13:24] that's all I need to maintain what I
[00:13:26] think is a pretty high level of
[00:13:29] productivity for a long time now as I've
[00:13:32] gotten deeper and deeper into
[00:13:34] understanding what makes productivity
[00:13:36] sustainable I've realized that when you
[00:13:39] have a system of productivity that uses
[00:13:41] so many different components each one of
[00:13:44] those components introduces a chance of
[00:13:47] error or complication it increases the
[00:13:49] amount of friction if there's an update
[00:13:51] on one app we have to think about how
[00:13:53] that update might affect us if there's
[00:13:55] you know one app doesn't work like we
[00:13:57] have to think of another workflow around
[00:13:59] that and so again I'm not saying don't
[00:14:01] use apps there are a lot of apps that I
[00:14:03] don't use that I know are very effective
[00:14:06] and can help you be really productive
[00:14:08] what I'm saying is that if you are in
[00:14:11] that mindset where you're constantly
[00:14:13] looking for more things that help you
[00:14:15] with your productivity you're probably
[00:14:17] going to get more value from learning to
[00:14:19] just do more with what you already have
[00:14:22] or even less of it number five
[00:14:25] prioritize deep flow I don't know if you
[00:14:28] know this already
[00:14:29] but there is no such thing as
[00:14:31] multitasking in fact trying to switch
[00:14:34] between multiple tasks constantly is
[00:14:37] very distracting and it reduces your
[00:14:39] overall productivity and for real
[00:14:41] productivity there are very few things
[00:14:43] more powerful than the ability to just
[00:14:46] have a single task and lock in that
[00:14:49] feeling of flow when you don't even know
[00:14:53] time is passing you are on a roll your
[00:14:55] brain is just wired in and it's just
[00:14:57] high quality work
[00:14:59] that being able to take that like if you
[00:15:02] could you know bottle that into a pill
[00:15:05] and just take that every single time
[00:15:07] that probably is a drug and it's
[00:15:08] probably illegal don't do that but like
[00:15:10] if you could just like you know wave a
[00:15:11] magic wand and access flow anytime that
[00:15:15] you
[00:15:15] wanted so many of your problems would be
[00:15:18] solved you would not get distracted as
[00:15:19] much your productivity would just go
[00:15:20] through the roof because you just get so
[00:15:22] much done when your brain is in that
[00:15:25] flow State and you can literally just
[00:15:27] use that as like you Universal question
[00:15:30] you ask yourself is this thing going to
[00:15:33] help or harm my ability to focus in and
[00:15:38] concentrate on a single task and again
[00:15:40] don't trust your brain don't trust that
[00:15:43] just because you want to enter into flow
[00:15:44] you will be able to enter into flow
[00:15:46] there are certain triggers that help you
[00:15:48] into flow and there are certain things
[00:15:49] that pull you out of flow you're not
[00:15:51] going to know what all of those things
[00:15:52] are off the bat learn about those expect
[00:15:56] to fail expect to try to enter into flow
[00:15:59] and struggle and then document it what's
[00:16:02] stopping you what hinders you and harms
[00:16:05] you from entering into that flow State
[00:16:07] and when you're in that flow what's
[00:16:09] pulling you out of it start
[00:16:11] understanding your personal barriers and
[00:16:14] triggers and optimize your environment
[00:16:17] and your processes to add or remove them
[00:16:19] and once you can figure that out then
[00:16:21] you're in a great position for the next
[00:16:23] one which is number six find flow times
[00:16:27] in your day I heavily underestimated
[00:16:30] this when I was in like halfway through
[00:16:33] University like fourth and fifth year of
[00:16:34] University I was entering into full-time
[00:16:37] Hospital placement so it's harder for me
[00:16:38] to find places to just sit down and just
[00:16:41] study for long periods of time during
[00:16:43] the day and so like I didn't think this
[00:16:46] would be a problem in my schedule I had
[00:16:48] this nice study block just after dinner
[00:16:51] and that was when I was meant to get all
[00:16:52] my you know deep work and studying done
[00:16:55] unfortunately my hit rate on being able
[00:16:59] to have a good study session during that
[00:17:00] block was like 50% half the time I don't
[00:17:03] get any study done because something
[00:17:05] happens during dinner or like it goes
[00:17:08] longer than expected or I feel sleepy or
[00:17:10] tired or there's some other distraction
[00:17:12] or I just want to relax and you know I
[00:17:14] just let myself relax instead and what I
[00:17:17] realized is that that period after
[00:17:18] dinner and this is true to this day is
[00:17:20] that that period of like 2 3 hours after
[00:17:23] dinner for me is like not a good flow
[00:17:27] time anytime I try to do anything that
[00:17:29] requires deep concentration immediately
[00:17:31] after dinner doesn't work uh same for
[00:17:33] immediately after lunch just doesn't
[00:17:35] work and so I deliberately do not plan
[00:17:39] anything that requires deep flow during
[00:17:41] those times because it's a highrisk move
[00:17:44] and what I found is that for me deep
[00:17:45] flow either happens around 400 p.m. just
[00:17:48] before dinner and I think the urgency of
[00:17:50] of eating is like kind of helps me
[00:17:53] through that or earlier in the morning
[00:17:56] or later at night and so depending on
[00:17:58] what my schedule looks looks like that's
[00:17:59] when I decide to do my most important
[00:18:01] tasks those are my Optimum flow times
[00:18:05] for the day and those times are going to
[00:18:06] be different for you so experiment a bit
[00:18:08] and figure it out now as you can see
[00:18:09] productivity is a very personalized
[00:18:12] thing and it's basically impossible to
[00:18:14] cover every single technique that you'll
[00:18:15] ever need that works for everyone but I
[00:18:17] still want to help you to build a
[00:18:19] personalized productivity system which
[00:18:21] is one of the reasons why I created my
[00:18:24] free Weekly Newsletter which goes
[00:18:26] through even more productivity
[00:18:28] techniques and tips to help you build a
[00:18:31] system that works for you each email
[00:18:33] takes about 3 to 5 minutes to read but
[00:18:35] can save you 3 to 10 hours a week as I
[00:18:38] said it's completely free I'll leave a
[00:18:40] link in the description below if you
[00:18:41] want to sign up and back to the next
[00:18:43] productivity tip number seven use a
[00:18:45] distraction cheat sheet I talk about
[00:18:48] this a lot but a distraction cheat sheet
[00:18:50] is literally just a piece of paper right
[00:18:52] next to you on your desk that you can
[00:18:55] have open while you're studying while
[00:18:58] you're working and anytime you get
[00:19:00] distracted you just write down what it
[00:19:03] is that distracted you and then you can
[00:19:06] try to remove it deal with the
[00:19:07] distraction get back to work but what it
[00:19:09] does is it means that over time as you
[00:19:12] start learning about the things that
[00:19:14] bring you in and out of
[00:19:16] focus you can start optimizing your
[00:19:18] environment deeper and in a more
[00:19:20] personalized way those distractions no
[00:19:23] longer affect you if you remove them in
[00:19:26] advance the problem is that we're often
[00:19:28] completely unaware of what those
[00:19:30] distractions are and we let them bother
[00:19:32] us every single time we have a study
[00:19:34] session funny example of this is um
[00:19:38] years ago when I was uh coaching this
[00:19:40] University student for the studying and
[00:19:42] they were always getting distracted
[00:19:43] because their dog uh so their brother
[00:19:46] used to always walk the dog during the
[00:19:48] day when they were studying and the dog
[00:19:49] would just go barking and crazy like you
[00:19:51] know as it's walking outside um but her
[00:19:55] desk was facing the window so as soon as
[00:19:57] they walk past she sees her brother and
[00:19:59] the dog walking through and because it's
[00:20:02] like barking and making a big scene
[00:20:04] that's the thing that pulls her out of
[00:20:06] focus and so when she gets pulled out of
[00:20:09] focus she really struggled with getting
[00:20:11] back into that flow and then by the time
[00:20:13] she's back into that flow Brothers back
[00:20:15] from the walk and then she gets broken
[00:20:17] out of flow again so it's kind of like
[00:20:18] this one two hours in between where it's
[00:20:20] like man this is really lowquality time
[00:20:23] being used I'm getting really really
[00:20:25] distracted uh and I feel like I've had a
[00:20:27] really good session that got disrupted
[00:20:29] and she said this has been happening for
[00:20:31] months and so she's a smart person it's
[00:20:33] not like she doesn't know that she could
[00:20:35] do something about it but it never
[00:20:36] really occurred to her to be proactive
[00:20:38] about that distraction because she never
[00:20:41] made it a point she would get distracted
[00:20:43] and be like okay well that's something
[00:20:44] that happened and then just focus on
[00:20:46] getting back into the task as soon as we
[00:20:49] brought it to light and made it clear
[00:20:52] this is the thing that's actually
[00:20:53] distracting you it became obvious like
[00:20:55] oh okay I'm just going to put headphones
[00:20:57] on turn my disc the other way away and
[00:20:59] literally overnight we solved it she
[00:21:01] just got like 1 to two hours of
[00:21:02] additional Focus per day just like that
[00:21:06] that's the power of just making the
[00:21:07] invisible visible it gives you the
[00:21:10] chance to do something about it and I
[00:21:12] can guarantee you that 70 80% of the
[00:21:17] things that distract you are things that
[00:21:19] you could easily solve that you just
[00:21:21] aren't aware of what the actual
[00:21:23] distraction is and the distraction cheat
[00:21:25] cheat helps with that number eight
[00:21:28] create Focus zones most of the time when
[00:21:31] people talk about Focus zones they're
[00:21:32] talking about a workspace like a
[00:21:34] physical desk that is free of clutter
[00:21:38] it's organized it's clean free of
[00:21:40] distractions to help you focus and and
[00:21:43] enter into flow and those are really
[00:21:44] important uh and I agree that you should
[00:21:46] do that but that's not where a focus
[00:21:50] zone ends and sometimes you don't have
[00:21:52] the choice and sometimes it's actually
[00:21:55] beneficial like I have always found that
[00:21:58] I respond very very well and am able to
[00:22:01] enter into deep flow when I go and work
[00:22:02] at cafes and I know this is not the same
[00:22:04] for everyone but I like to go to a cafe
[00:22:06] find a nice quiet table by a corner uh
[00:22:09] plug in some noise cancelling earphones
[00:22:11] listen some white noise uh and just
[00:22:14] focus in and I'm able to lock in very
[00:22:17] very very
[00:22:18] quickly if I work at a cafe every single
[00:22:20] day that effect actually disappears and
[00:22:22] I've tested that uh but that's not an
[00:22:25] optimized environment whatsoever you
[00:22:27] know like I've got a tomato sauce bottle
[00:22:29] like kind of like bumping against my
[00:22:30] elbow like it's not comfortable there's
[00:22:32] lots of distractions so why is it that
[00:22:34] that becomes such a good focus zone and
[00:22:36] this is the important thing is that a
[00:22:38] focus zone is really just a mental head
[00:22:41] space your focus zone can be in any
[00:22:44] situation that you want as long as you
[00:22:45] know what criteria need to be met for
[00:22:48] your brain to enter into that mode of
[00:22:51] getting into deep flow and this is the
[00:22:53] thing that really allowed me to have
[00:22:56] really good productivity like when I'm
[00:22:58] TR traveling I'm on a plane I'm in a car
[00:23:00] I'm walking uh I'm like driving you know
[00:23:04] I'm in a cafe wherever it is and for me
[00:23:06] what I realized is that number one noise
[00:23:09] is the biggest thing so if I've got
[00:23:11] noise cancelling headphones uh and I've
[00:23:13] got white noise playing 70% of that
[00:23:16] criteria for me is met the second thing
[00:23:19] is the state of mind when I'm entering
[00:23:22] into that
[00:23:23] environment if I am like watching a
[00:23:27] YouTube video I'm watching some Netflix
[00:23:29] on my laptop and I'm in that mode and
[00:23:33] I'm at my desk which is a perfect
[00:23:35] environment and then I'm like okay time
[00:23:36] for me to do some study or work it's
[00:23:39] much much more difficult for me to enter
[00:23:41] into that flow because I didn't enter
[00:23:43] that environment with the purpose of
[00:23:46] working this is actually the reason why
[00:23:47] I don't do that at all anymore like this
[00:23:50] room that I'm in I am in this room only
[00:23:52] to work as soon as I'm done with work I
[00:23:54] actually leave the room I do not enter
[00:23:55] here unless it is intentionally for work
[00:23:58] work but it's the same thing for when I
[00:23:59] go to a cafe I go to a cafe not to drink
[00:24:02] coffee and like have fun and then I like
[00:24:04] oh I may as well do some work here I'm
[00:24:06] going to a cafe explicitly for the
[00:24:08] intention of doing some work and it is
[00:24:10] that the entering of a space with the
[00:24:14] intention of doing something that helps
[00:24:17] prep my mind for flow and the
[00:24:19] interesting thing that I found is that
[00:24:20] this works in a lot of different
[00:24:22] scenarios like even getting on a plane
[00:24:25] sometimes and I've done a lot of
[00:24:26] traveling in the last couple years I'll
[00:24:28] get onto a plane and I'll think okay so
[00:24:30] I've got some time here I could just
[00:24:31] crack out some work I'll get onto the
[00:24:34] plane I'll have my laptop there and I'll
[00:24:36] think okay well what's there to watch
[00:24:38] you know in terms of like the inflight
[00:24:39] entertainment I'll take out my laptop
[00:24:41] and I'll try to do some work but it
[00:24:42] doesn't feel very good other times I'm
[00:24:45] like all right I need to get this thing
[00:24:47] done I've got 2 hours on this plane
[00:24:49] that's when I'm going to do it as soon
[00:24:51] as I walk into the plane and take my
[00:24:53] seat I am already like prepped and
[00:24:55] primed to do work like that is the int
[00:24:58] ion almost of being on that plane in a
[00:25:01] way and it is so much easier for me to
[00:25:03] enter into that flow and so intention
[00:25:06] actually makes a huge difference which
[00:25:08] is why a ha tip for helping to create a
[00:25:11] focus zone is not only think about what
[00:25:14] are the distractions and limit the
[00:25:16] distractions but it's actually set clear
[00:25:19] intentions don't let yourself kind of
[00:25:21] like roll in to your focus activity make
[00:25:24] a clear boundary between what you were
[00:25:26] doing before and the focused task that
[00:25:29] you want to do have a clear intention
[00:25:32] even you can even write it down
[00:25:34] especially I recommend this for my ADHD
[00:25:36] students is like write it down like on a
[00:25:38] Post-It note like stick it on your
[00:25:39] monitor or something like very clearly
[00:25:42] and enter the environment into the
[00:25:45] activity very actively with that clear
[00:25:48] intention and once that's done leave
[00:25:51] exit from that jump out of the plane
[00:25:54] pull the emergency it's like I'm done
[00:25:56] with my work send the email emergency
[00:25:57] exit open skydiving out you know that's
[00:26:00] uh make that entry and exit into your
[00:26:03] focus zone very deliberate and very
[00:26:06] quickly you'll start realizing that it's
[00:26:08] much easier to to get into to Flow by
[00:26:11] the way don't jump out of a plane if I
[00:26:13] needed to say that for YouTube number
[00:26:15] nine use work rest timers you've
[00:26:19] probably heard of Pomodoro which is like
[00:26:22] a 25 minute uh work block followed by a
[00:26:24] 5 minute or 10 minute rest uh this is
[00:26:27] called a work rest timer do you have
[00:26:29] work and then you've got rest timed and
[00:26:31] there's lots of different variations
[00:26:33] Pomodoro flow modoro uh I've got my own
[00:26:36] uh called off optimize for Focus work
[00:26:37] rest timing uh at the end of the day it
[00:26:41] doesn't really matter which one you use
[00:26:43] but if you really need to lock in then
[00:26:45] using a work rest timer can help you
[00:26:47] because it creates a sense of urgency
[00:26:49] when you're doing your focused work and
[00:26:51] it means that when you take your rest
[00:26:52] that's timed as well so it prevents you
[00:26:55] from getting distracted with something
[00:26:56] else there are a couple cavates though
[00:26:58] that I found make work rest timing much
[00:27:01] more effective first of all if you are
[00:27:03] in a really good Flow State you can do
[00:27:05] work potentially for 1 2 3 hours without
[00:27:08] needing the break taking the break from
[00:27:11] a Pomodoro time and this is the main
[00:27:13] issue I have with like a fixed timer
[00:27:15] like the original Pomodoro is that you
[00:27:17] can have 25 minutes of great focus and
[00:27:19] then you break for no reason you don't
[00:27:22] need the rest you're in a great state
[00:27:25] and now when you try to get back into it
[00:27:27] it takes time take you 5 10 minutes just
[00:27:29] to get back into that sense of flow that
[00:27:31] you had before and pick up where your
[00:27:33] thoughts left off don't do that start a
[00:27:37] timer figure out how long you generally
[00:27:40] tend to be able to enter into a flow
[00:27:41] state for before you feel like you're
[00:27:43] getting a little distracted you're
[00:27:44] losing your Edge you might need that
[00:27:46] break and just get a sense for how long
[00:27:48] that is and maybe that is only 20 25
[00:27:51] minutes that's fine but maybe it's 45
[00:27:54] minutes maybe it's an hour and get a
[00:27:56] general sense for how long you're able
[00:27:58] to stay in flow in different kind of
[00:28:01] energy levels usually if I sit down to
[00:28:04] do some work I'll be able to tell okay I
[00:28:06] feel like I'll be able to have a really
[00:28:08] good 1 and a half hour focused flow
[00:28:11] session whereas sometimes I feel like
[00:28:13] I'm going to struggle getting through
[00:28:14] half an hour that's fine like that's
[00:28:17] life that's us understanding that our
[00:28:19] brain isn't perfect so make the work
[00:28:23] time roughly similar to where you expect
[00:28:26] your flow is going to end and again that
[00:28:29] takes a little bit of experimentation
[00:28:31] and then the rest time generally keep
[00:28:34] that to about a quarter to a third of
[00:28:37] how long you did your work for and then
[00:28:39] monitor how long you're able to focus
[00:28:41] for later so if you take a rest and then
[00:28:44] you go back into another session but now
[00:28:46] you find that your second session is
[00:28:47] like half the amount of focus as the
[00:28:49] first one your rest was probably a
[00:28:52] little bit too short or you were getting
[00:28:54] distracted with other things during your
[00:28:55] rest instead of letting your brain
[00:28:56] recover number 10 hire the babysitter
[00:29:00] let's say you have a baby and you want
[00:29:04] to go on a holiday you would hopefully
[00:29:07] not leave the baby just alone for like 3
[00:29:11] days while you go on vacation you're not
[00:29:14] going to like just leave all the knives
[00:29:16] on the ground and just like the baby
[00:29:19] just crawling around like I'm sure the
[00:29:21] baby will be fine like you wouldn't do
[00:29:23] that you would hire a babysitter to look
[00:29:26] after the baby while you're you're gone
[00:29:28] the higher the babysitter is like this
[00:29:32] ridiculous concept that of course we
[00:29:34] wouldn't do that for a baby because we
[00:29:36] understand that a baby is like fragile
[00:29:38] and precious and the risk and the
[00:29:40] consequence if you were to do that could
[00:29:42] be catastrophic and I think we should
[00:29:45] think about that for our time as
[00:29:48] well time is one of the most precious
[00:29:50] resources that we have and we do often
[00:29:54] very very little to protect our time
[00:29:58] here's an example back in the early days
[00:29:59] I always used to schedule like a like a
[00:30:04] planning prioritization session
[00:30:06] immediately as I got home from school or
[00:30:09] uni I think I probably managed to do it
[00:30:12] 5% of the time because every time I get
[00:30:16] home I just can't be bothered I'm just
[00:30:19] too tired when I enter through that door
[00:30:22] a wave of
[00:30:24] uncontrollable relaxation envelops my
[00:30:27] body and I realized that I don't want to
[00:30:30] be productive uh I want to be a blob and
[00:30:33] so I just don't do anything hire the
[00:30:35] babysitter in this context means that we
[00:30:37] recognize again we're not trusting our
[00:30:39] brain to just follow through on it we
[00:30:42] recognize that there are these risks to
[00:30:46] our time and we deliberately take
[00:30:48] actions and steps to prevent that I call
[00:30:52] this time
[00:30:53] protection so let's say you get home at
[00:30:56] 5:00 p.m. and so between 5:00 to 5:30
[00:30:59] you had scheduled some meditation
[00:31:02] session great but every single time you
[00:31:05] get home you're too tired and you never
[00:31:07] do it all right so how could we protect
[00:31:09] that time well the reason we don't do it
[00:31:12] is because we feel tired so perhaps what
[00:31:15] we can do is immediately when we get
[00:31:17] home instead of trying to do the
[00:31:18] meditation we go for a 5 minute walk a
[00:31:22] stroll around the block that gives us a
[00:31:23] little bit of energy maybe we just do
[00:31:26] five push-ups just enough to give us a
[00:31:29] little bit of energy and by adding that
[00:31:32] additional task which isn't the number
[00:31:35] one
[00:31:36] priority it actually helps us transition
[00:31:39] into the number one priority hiring the
[00:31:41] babysitter for your productivity means
[00:31:44] recognizing that your time is always
[00:31:46] under attack from other people uh that
[00:31:50] want your attention from unforeseen
[00:31:51] events life in general these are things
[00:31:54] that are going to rob that time that you
[00:31:57] have carved out for something that you
[00:31:59] know is important for your life and for
[00:32:00] you to progress towards your goals and
[00:32:03] if it is important to do it's important
[00:32:05] enough to hire the babysitter protect
[00:32:08] against those risks and if you cannot if
[00:32:11] the babysitter is not available at that
[00:32:13] time don't just leave move it to a
[00:32:15] different time if you cannot do anything
[00:32:19] that helps you be more energized if you
[00:32:21] can't do anything that helps you be more
[00:32:22] concentrated to do your meditation or
[00:32:24] whatever it is that you are planning to
[00:32:25] do at 5:00 p.m. don't schedule it for
[00:32:28] 5:00 p.m. because by doing that you are
[00:32:31] saying I recognize the risk it's likely
[00:32:33] to happen and I'm willing to let it
[00:32:35] happen anyway and if it's important
[00:32:37] that's not wise number 11 plan for the
[00:32:40] real not the ideal one of the things
[00:32:43] that Hannah used to do the classmate I
[00:32:46] told you about is that she would have
[00:32:48] these really packed schedules and if she
[00:32:52] was able to do all of the stuff in that
[00:32:53] day should be like achieving her goals
[00:32:56] like that's great but most of the time
[00:32:59] those schedules don't happen as planned
[00:33:02] most of the time she's reaching the end
[00:33:03] of the day feeling like a failure
[00:33:06] because she wasn't able to take off
[00:33:07] everything on that list but her
[00:33:10] rationale for having it on the list was
[00:33:13] well if I don't do it if I don't
[00:33:17] complete these tasks to this schedule
[00:33:20] then I'm never going to be able to reach
[00:33:21] my goal I'm like I'm not it's it's
[00:33:25] already not enough if I start taking
[00:33:28] things off it will definitely not be
[00:33:30] enough so I said Hannah there is no
[00:33:33] point making a fantasy schedule just
[00:33:37] because it's written down in your
[00:33:40] schedule obviously doesn't mean it's
[00:33:43] going to occur and if you know that it's
[00:33:47] not realistic and you have repeatedly
[00:33:50] seen that the schedules you make are
[00:33:52] ones that you're not able to
[00:33:54] consistently
[00:33:55] complete and you keep scheduling in that
[00:33:59] same way you're living in a
[00:34:01] fantasy whether you like it or not
[00:34:04] you're getting less done than you
[00:34:06] planned the only difference now is that
[00:34:09] in one situation you recognize
[00:34:13] realistically how much you're getting
[00:34:15] done and you can now proactively plan
[00:34:18] for how you might mitigate that risk and
[00:34:21] still achieve your goals whereas on the
[00:34:23] other hand you are planning and
[00:34:26] imagining that you're going to have that
[00:34:27] that perfect brain that's able to do
[00:34:30] everything every single day for the next
[00:34:32] 3 months and nothing's going to go wrong
[00:34:36] and anytime something does go wrong now
[00:34:38] you're reacting you're getting a spike
[00:34:40] in cortisol your stress is increasing
[00:34:43] it's decreasing your quality of life
[00:34:45] it's making you more anxious and every
[00:34:47] single day you are hitting yourself with
[00:34:49] the burden of having to replan
[00:34:52] reschedule and rep prioritize and
[00:34:54] constantly feeling like you're falling
[00:34:55] behind but the reason you're fall
[00:34:57] falling behind is because you are
[00:34:59] setting a goal where catching up is not
[00:35:03] realistic and so one of the most
[00:35:05] important First Steps before you start
[00:35:07] scheduling and using time blocking or
[00:35:10] time boxing is to do a Time Track when
[00:35:15] you're first starting out don't create
[00:35:18] like an elaborate schedule just do
[00:35:21] things in your day that you think you
[00:35:23] need to do and
[00:35:25] retrospectively note down how long
[00:35:28] everything took you make your schedule
[00:35:30] in
[00:35:31] retrospect and what this will do is this
[00:35:33] will give you visibility on how much
[00:35:36] you're able to get done on different
[00:35:39] kinds of days like on a bad day this is
[00:35:41] what I get done on an average day this
[00:35:43] is what I get done on a good day this is
[00:35:44] what I get done and then start seeing
[00:35:47] how many good days versus average days
[00:35:50] do you have what a fix that try to have
[00:35:52] more good days but have a realistic
[00:35:55] understanding of how much you're able to
[00:35:56] get done and when you make a plan you
[00:35:59] now have data you know how much you can
[00:36:01] get done on an average day and you know
[00:36:04] that maybe you can schedule in one or
[00:36:06] two good days per week because you know
[00:36:08] you can pull that off and if you do this
[00:36:10] and you realize man if I schedule things
[00:36:12] in this way I'm not going to be able to
[00:36:14] reach my goal you only have two options
[00:36:17] there number one have more good days
[00:36:21] which is by the way really really hard
[00:36:23] to do is really hard to have
[00:36:25] consistently good days every single day
[00:36:27] for an extended period of time so if
[00:36:29] you're like just not going to make it
[00:36:32] maybe that's a viable option but if
[00:36:33] there's a big gap between what you need
[00:36:35] to do and what you've scheduled then
[00:36:36] that's probably not viable the second
[00:36:39] thing is you got to evaluate either your
[00:36:40] goal or your methods and it's a tough
[00:36:43] pill to swallow to say re-evaluate the
[00:36:45] goal to say that hey like based on this
[00:36:48] realistic semi- optimistic schedule that
[00:36:51] you've made you still will not be able
[00:36:53] to reach that goal that may be the
[00:36:56] reality and if you put yourself in that
[00:36:59] position now you can at least plan okay
[00:37:02] this is likely what's going to happen
[00:37:05] I'm going to still try to have more good
[00:37:06] days but I have to expect that this is
[00:37:09] maybe the reality that I won't be able
[00:37:11] to meet this go but again when at first
[00:37:14] I fail re-evaluate ask myself why and
[00:37:18] then try it again differently next time
[00:37:21] what will I do differently how will I
[00:37:23] hit the goal next time and it puts
[00:37:24] yourself in a much more productive
[00:37:26] mindset reality happens whether you like
[00:37:29] it or not so plan for the real not the
[00:37:32] ideal now we're only just over halfway
[00:37:34] through the video and I'm still just
[00:37:37] scratching the surface of the research
[00:37:40] and my experience at becoming more
[00:37:43] productive so if you're enjoying this
[00:37:44] format please let me know in the
[00:37:46] comments so that I know that I can keep
[00:37:48] making these types of videos for you 13
[00:37:52] years is a very long time to spend on
[00:37:55] learning about learning and productivity
[00:37:58] and I've picked up hundreds of these
[00:38:01] tips and pieces of advice that i' would
[00:38:03] love to share with you and your comments
[00:38:05] help me know what to focus on now onto
[00:38:07] the next game changer productivity tip
[00:38:10] number
[00:38:11] 12 or not and one of my uh coaching
[00:38:16] clients recently emailed me asking hey
[00:38:18] Justin I'm really interested in rolling
[00:38:21] in this new German course uh because
[00:38:23] they just want to learn how to speak
[00:38:25] German um and and they're currently
[00:38:28] going through and also doing a course on
[00:38:30] AI and machine learning and so I said
[00:38:35] cool that's that's a great idea what do
[00:38:38] you want to give up to do that and they
[00:38:41] said what do you mean I I just want to
[00:38:43] do the German course I said well look
[00:38:46] you're already running your business
[00:38:48] you're already doing an AI ml course
[00:38:51] you're already taking my program and
[00:38:53] getting coaching from me you have a
[00:38:55] family uh and kids that already feel
[00:38:57] like you don't spend enough time with
[00:38:58] them uh and now you're saying that you
[00:39:01] want to pick up a German course I'm all
[00:39:05] for doing more things that provide
[00:39:07] fulfillment but also I'm all for
[00:39:09] realizing that time is limited and we
[00:39:12] have to spend our time on the things
[00:39:14] that make the most impact and value to
[00:39:16] us remember productivity is not about
[00:39:18] being busy productivity is about doing
[00:39:21] the things that get us towards your goal
[00:39:24] and I know I was talking to him that for
[00:39:26] you your main goal is to provide for
[00:39:29] your
[00:39:29] family how is a German course helping
[00:39:33] with that goal is that productive or not
[00:39:36] what do you want to take away and this
[00:39:37] is the or not and framework instead of
[00:39:40] saying I want to do this and this we
[00:39:44] make a much more strict prioritization
[00:39:46] by saying I want to do this or this we
[00:39:50] Face ourselves with the consequence of
[00:39:53] losing something we already have to
[00:39:56] justify whether we want to do something
[00:39:58] else or do something new and I think
[00:40:00] this is really valuable for people that
[00:40:02] just can't say no right is that like
[00:40:06] great you want to do something else
[00:40:09] awesome you can say yes you just have to
[00:40:11] know that you're saying or not and it's
[00:40:15] not yes you'll do this and all your
[00:40:17] other stuff if you decide to do this
[00:40:20] what will you choose to discard from
[00:40:23] what you're already doing and if you
[00:40:26] can't look at anything you already doing
[00:40:27] and say yes I'm willing to discard that
[00:40:30] then you have to be very very honest
[00:40:32] with yourself do I already have enough
[00:40:34] time for all of that and time for myself
[00:40:39] with not trusting my brain and having
[00:40:41] enough room for
[00:40:43] error if the answer is yes cool maybe
[00:40:46] you can just do it your underc capacity
[00:40:48] feel free just do it it's an and
[00:40:51] situation most of the time especially if
[00:40:53] you feel busy that's not going to be the
[00:40:55] case most of the time you barely have
[00:40:57] enough time for all of this stuff you
[00:40:59] almost never have time for yourself and
[00:41:02] your room for error is Raaz or thin as
[00:41:04] it is you already need to take one of
[00:41:07] those things that you're doing and then
[00:41:08] stop doing them that and is not going to
[00:41:10] happen that's an a situation so or not
[00:41:14] and now you might say okay well I
[00:41:17] understand that I meant to do less and
[00:41:19] focus on more things like more deeply
[00:41:21] but I see all these other people that
[00:41:22] are way more productive than me that get
[00:41:24] way more stuffed done how do I become
[00:41:26] like them well there are a few
[00:41:28] strategies that I've picked up over the
[00:41:30] years that have actually allowed me to
[00:41:32] just literally do more stuff and have a
[00:41:35] greater capacity and these are my
[00:41:37] favorite ones number 13 use the
[00:41:41] two-minute rule the two-minute rule says
[00:41:44] that if you have a list of things that
[00:41:46] you need to do and it takes you 2
[00:41:49] minutes or less to do it don't bother
[00:41:53] scheduling it in or prioritizing it just
[00:41:57] do do it the time it takes for you to
[00:41:59] think about and consider and schedule
[00:42:02] and prioritize and and just having that
[00:42:04] as an item on your schedule that you
[00:42:06] need to like rejig with everything else
[00:42:08] is not worth the effort if you can just
[00:42:09] get it done within 2 minutes or less so
[00:42:11] often this will be things that are like
[00:42:13] emails
[00:42:15] messages taking out the bins um setting
[00:42:19] a la you setting up the laundry like
[00:42:21] household chores little things here and
[00:42:24] there like they take very short amount
[00:42:26] of time it's better to have them off
[00:42:28] your plate and checked off than to even
[00:42:31] spend the time to think about it once
[00:42:32] you've done all of your two-minute tasks
[00:42:35] number 14 book The scan a lot of the
[00:42:39] time I spent as a junior doctor was in
[00:42:41] surgical rotations and in a surgical
[00:42:43] Ward round we're seeing like 100 150
[00:42:47] patients in the morning and then we have
[00:42:49] to rush off into the operating theater
[00:42:51] and so you have very very little time to
[00:42:54] see each patient like literally with
[00:42:56] spinning like 10 to 20 seconds per
[00:42:59] patient we have and during that time we
[00:43:00] have to write up an entire set of notes
[00:43:03] uh figure out what the plan is and as a
[00:43:06] junior you're just like following along
[00:43:08] trying to desperately keep up with with
[00:43:09] what's going on and one of the things
[00:43:12] that we were taught to do is just to
[00:43:14] book the scans right there on the spot
[00:43:18] don't wait until we've seen all the
[00:43:20] patients to then look at your list of
[00:43:21] patients and be like okay so this one
[00:43:23] needs a CT scan this one needs an X-ray
[00:43:25] this one needs whatever and then at that
[00:43:27] point go and make the request for like
[00:43:29] this patient needs a CT scan for this
[00:43:31] thing why why should we not do that and
[00:43:34] why should we book The scan immediately
[00:43:36] on the spot because once you send the
[00:43:40] request to book a scan it takes time for
[00:43:44] that request to be received and then
[00:43:46] approved maybe they've got questions and
[00:43:48] then an orderly will come and collect
[00:43:50] the bed they get taken off and so that
[00:43:52] will takes time by the time we are done
[00:43:55] with our round we need to get into
[00:43:57] operating theater and start operating so
[00:43:59] if patients haven't had their scans yet
[00:44:01] all of these things create delays and so
[00:44:04] that might mean that someone that could
[00:44:06] have been operated on today gets
[00:44:07] operated on tomorrow or next week
[00:44:10] because of a four five 10 20 minute
[00:44:14] delay and requesting a scan in
[00:44:16] productivity there are certain tasks
[00:44:19] that don't take that long for you to do
[00:44:22] but there is a delay in someone else
[00:44:26] having to receive it having to think
[00:44:28] about it asking questions it's being
[00:44:30] sent out to someone else so for you it
[00:44:33] may not be like that important of a task
[00:44:36] for you to do right now and it may not
[00:44:39] be that urgent for you right now but
[00:44:41] it's understanding that by booking the
[00:44:43] scan first sending that message sending
[00:44:46] that email to someone sending that thing
[00:44:48] for them to review now early on you are
[00:44:52] unblocking your future self Because by
[00:44:56] the time you need to do something about
[00:44:58] that it's already come back to you
[00:45:00] because the worst thing is for you to do
[00:45:02] all the stuff that you need to do you're
[00:45:03] like in this really good State and then
[00:45:05] you've got all these things that now
[00:45:06] just waiting for other people and now
[00:45:08] you have nothing it's just like cool
[00:45:09] just twiddle my thumbs now waiting for
[00:45:12] other people to get back to me and then
[00:45:14] if you're in a team environment where
[00:45:16] like other people are depending on your
[00:45:18] work and they're waiting for updates or
[00:45:20] feedback or they're waiting for you to
[00:45:22] send them something then they're blocked
[00:45:24] as well while until you send it to them
[00:45:26] so
[00:45:27] book The scan first send things that
[00:45:30] depend on other people and take time for
[00:45:34] them do that early and then move on to
[00:45:37] your other stuff number 15 batch tasks
[00:45:40] together this might be an obvious one
[00:45:42] for some of you but let's say that
[00:45:44] you've got a bunch of like admin tasks
[00:45:46] that are not very difficult uh but
[00:45:49] there's just lots of little
[00:45:50] miscellaneous things to do take all of
[00:45:53] those things and instead of letting them
[00:45:55] distract you here and there throughout
[00:45:57] the day and then like it's interrupting
[00:45:59] your Flow State for the things you
[00:46:00] really need to focus and concentrate on
[00:46:02] and then you're just building up this
[00:46:03] backlog of stuff that you're kind of
[00:46:05] anxious about schedule a time of day
[00:46:08] like 1 hour where you get all of those
[00:46:10] tasks and you do all of them together
[00:46:12] you're trying to take your relatively
[00:46:15] low effort non-urgent things that aren't
[00:46:18] too important put them all together and
[00:46:20] get them done in One Sweep and we do
[00:46:23] this to keep the rest of our day
[00:46:25] relatively focused and clutter free free
[00:46:27] because number
[00:46:29] 16 eat the
[00:46:31] Frog if I hold up a frog to you and I
[00:46:34] say eat it uh your immediate reaction is
[00:46:38] probably going to be like hm I'd rather
[00:46:40] not eat that living frog you're giving
[00:46:43] me uh and so that's what e the Frog
[00:46:45] means it means look at the thing that
[00:46:47] you don't want to do and do it because
[00:46:51] that thing that you don't want to do the
[00:46:53] frog is probably the task that is the
[00:46:57] biggest the most overwhelming is the
[00:46:59] most complicated and therefore is
[00:47:01] probably the most substantial and most
[00:47:04] meaningful not all of the time but often
[00:47:08] the bigger media tasks are the ones that
[00:47:12] are the most important they're the ones
[00:47:14] we procrastinate on so eat the Frog
[00:47:17] means that becomes task number one you
[00:47:19] do all of your two-minute tasks you book
[00:47:21] your scans you set aside a time for
[00:47:24] doing the batch tasks later and then
[00:47:26] your first main area of concentration
[00:47:28] and flow is the Frog task and the main
[00:47:31] reason that people don't eat the frog is
[00:47:35] because eating the frog is overwhelming
[00:47:38] you need to write an essay that's a lot
[00:47:40] of steps you need to do a big round of
[00:47:42] studying on a massive topic that's going
[00:47:44] to be a lot of work remember you can't
[00:47:46] trust your brain your brain is trying to
[00:47:47] keep you alive and that sounds like a
[00:47:49] lot of energy what if we
[00:47:52] die so we can trick our brain and make
[00:47:55] eating the Frog a a little bit easier
[00:47:58] because we don't have to eat the Frog we
[00:48:00] can just nibble the
[00:48:02] Frog which is number
[00:48:04] 17 leave tasks
[00:48:08] unfinished this is leveraging something
[00:48:10] called the zyonik effect which is named
[00:48:12] after a Russian
[00:48:14] psychologist and the zyonik effect says
[00:48:17] that it is more motivating for us to
[00:48:20] finish a task when it is already left
[00:48:24] unfinished and so this makes it really
[00:48:26] interesting because now to be more
[00:48:29] productive our main goal is not to
[00:48:32] finish a task if we understand the zonic
[00:48:35] effect and we understand that
[00:48:37] overwhelming tasks become easier to
[00:48:39] finish and we're more motivated to
[00:48:41] finish them if we started and left them
[00:48:45] incomplete our goal
[00:48:47] becomes leave tasks
[00:48:50] incomplete nibble the Frog take that
[00:48:53] huge overwhelming task make a start on
[00:48:56] it and with the clear intention that
[00:48:58] you're not going to finish just start
[00:49:01] see where you get to see what you're
[00:49:02] able to do and then just stop it is a
[00:49:05] liberating freeing feeling suddenly your
[00:49:09] productivity goes through the roof
[00:49:11] because you're not procrastinating
[00:49:12] anymore because nothing is overwhelming
[00:49:14] because every frog can just be nibbled
[00:49:17] that's the zonic effect now all of the
[00:49:19] stuff is basically trying to keep you in
[00:49:21] that flow State like I said that deep
[00:49:23] flow is super super important one of the
[00:49:25] things that pulls us out of flow is
[00:49:28] something called decision fatigue so
[00:49:31] number 18 is delete decision fatigue
[00:49:36] with pre-planned choices I want you to
[00:49:38] imagine your productivity is like a bow
[00:49:41] and arrow when you are shooting a bow
[00:49:43] and arrow you're spending the effort and
[00:49:45] energy up front to aim pick the
[00:49:48] trajectory and then fire and when you
[00:49:50] release the arrow that arrow is just
[00:49:52] traveling it's just going it's not
[00:49:54] soaring through the air thinking about
[00:49:56] where it needs to land it's just going
[00:49:57] and landing and when it lands you can
[00:49:59] pick it up aim and then shoot it
[00:50:00] somewhere else but decision fatigue
[00:50:04] happens when we don't do that we don't
[00:50:07] spend the effort up front to figure out
[00:50:09] the trajectory of where we're going to
[00:50:10] shoot towards and we are the arrow
[00:50:13] midair trying to figure out how to fly
[00:50:16] decision fatigue happens when we are
[00:50:18] trying to figure out throughout the day
[00:50:21] what to do next and it's incredibly
[00:50:24] detrimental to staying in flow and using
[00:50:26] your C nitive energy effectively you
[00:50:28] want to do that planning upfront with
[00:50:32] those pre-planned choices you look at
[00:50:34] what you need to do you set aside a
[00:50:36] schedule for the day or for the week you
[00:50:39] prioritize a task you think about what
[00:50:40] the two-minute tasks are you do those
[00:50:42] you think about what the scans are that
[00:50:43] you need to book you do those book The
[00:50:45] scan style tasks you think about your
[00:50:48] focus zones you think about which frogs
[00:50:50] need to be nibbled on or eaten
[00:50:52] throughout that week uh and during the
[00:50:54] day all you're doing is is executing
[00:50:57] you've got a plan you've got a list and
[00:50:58] you're just going to execute all you're
[00:51:01] doing is you're flying through the air
[00:51:04] trying to stay in flow that's the number
[00:51:06] one priority and the most common thing
[00:51:08] that pulls people out from that flow
[00:51:11] that makes it so that you have that
[00:51:14] decision fatigue is when you don't plan
[00:51:16] for the real and you're planning for the
[00:51:18] ideal cuz when you have a fantasy
[00:51:20] schedule where you imagine like you're
[00:51:22] going to get all the stuff done and
[00:51:24] everything's going to go perfectly
[00:51:25] according to plan and you give yourself
[00:51:27] no room for error as soon as one thing
[00:51:30] goes wrong it affects every other event
[00:51:33] for the rest of the day so now you have
[00:51:35] to replan in the middle of your day that
[00:51:38] adds decision fatigue it makes it harder
[00:51:40] to stay in flow it reduces your overall
[00:51:42] productivity if you have a better plan
[00:51:44] at with more room for error and more
[00:51:46] flexibility then if something goes wrong
[00:51:48] it's not a big deal it's like liquid it
[00:51:50] just fills itself you can stay in flow
[00:51:52] and you know what you need to do next
[00:51:54] once you start making pre-planned Cho
[00:51:56] choices to reduce this decision fatigue
[00:51:59] life just gets easier and I think a
[00:52:02] really underrated part of
[00:52:05] selfcare is taking the time to properly
[00:52:10] plan and prioritize your week take the
[00:52:12] time for yourself so that the future
[00:52:15] version of you has a better week number
[00:52:18] 19 stay on the pulse sometimes it's not
[00:52:22] possible to schedule everything in
[00:52:23] advance because you don't know when
[00:52:25] things are happening or you're waiting
[00:52:26] on other information from someone else
[00:52:29] uh so you need to be nimble you need to
[00:52:30] be on your feet and adaptable to
[00:52:32] changing that schedule as it happens
[00:52:34] that's life that's fine this is where
[00:52:36] staying on the pulse helps back when I
[00:52:39] was working in the hospital uh one of my
[00:52:41] first rotations in general surgery I
[00:52:44] remember it was around 1100 a.m. and my
[00:52:48] senior consultant he comes up to me and
[00:52:50] he goes hey Justin have you seen the
[00:52:52] blood test results for this patient you
[00:52:54] can see that this result is abnormal
[00:52:57] and I was like oh yeah I was just going
[00:52:59] to check that like straight after this
[00:53:02] um and he said no you need to stay on
[00:53:04] the
[00:53:04] post when that blood test result comes
[00:53:07] out you need to be immediately on that
[00:53:10] and checking that and you need to tell
[00:53:12] us straight away if there's something
[00:53:13] wrong with it because that patient is
[00:53:15] scheduled for surgery later that day and
[00:53:18] that means that if this patient is
[00:53:20] unwell they're not fit for surgery that
[00:53:22] changes the entire surgical schedule so
[00:53:25] that result
[00:53:26] came out around 10:00 a.m. so for 1 hour
[00:53:31] I hadn't checked it now for most people
[00:53:33] that may not seem like a big deal but in
[00:53:35] the hospital in a surgical environment
[00:53:36] that 1 hour is a big deal and the advice
[00:53:39] that he gave to me that day Shout Out Mr
[00:53:42] T uh sticks with me stay on the pulse
[00:53:46] figure out what is the pulse rate of the
[00:53:49] thing that you're trying to track or
[00:53:50] that you're worried about what the post
[00:53:53] rate means is how quickly are things
[00:53:55] changing in a meaningful enough way for
[00:53:58] it to make a difference for example the
[00:54:00] blood test result it comes out like the
[00:54:03] post rate on that is hourly like 30
[00:54:06] minutely so I need to be checking that
[00:54:09] 30 minutely to make sure that I'm able
[00:54:11] to get that information and then relay
[00:54:14] that information because that is
[00:54:16] important it makes a difference so the
[00:54:18] information has an impact on what I
[00:54:20] might do how I might prioritize my other
[00:54:23] tasks how I might schedule my other task
[00:54:25] how I might execute my other tasks how
[00:54:28] quickly does that tend to
[00:54:31] change that's your post rate and that's
[00:54:33] how often you should be checking or
[00:54:36] adjusting your schedule so if you are in
[00:54:38] a situation where you know that there
[00:54:39] are lots of things that tend to change
[00:54:42] every single day that could impact your
[00:54:45] schedule or the importance of the task
[00:54:48] you need to do but you're making a
[00:54:50] schedule for your entire week you're
[00:54:52] missing the post if that's the daily
[00:54:55] change that you expect you need to be
[00:54:57] making a daily schedule and rep
[00:54:59] prioritizing every single day let's say
[00:55:02] you're trying to learn how to increase
[00:55:04] your focus zones and how to enter into
[00:55:06] deep flow you should be reflecting on
[00:55:09] that every single day maybe twice a day
[00:55:12] because every time you try to enter into
[00:55:15] deep flow you're getting new information
[00:55:16] that changes how you may try to enter
[00:55:18] into deep flow the next time one of the
[00:55:21] things I see all the time with people
[00:55:22] learning to learn is that they'll use a
[00:55:24] bunch of new techniques and they won't
[00:55:26] spend the time to reflect on how those
[00:55:28] techniques are going and make
[00:55:30] adjustments and change their experiment
[00:55:32] for like 1 2 3 weeks and so by the time
[00:55:35] they realize it's not really working
[00:55:37] they've already spent two three weeks
[00:55:40] basically wasting that time just making
[00:55:43] the same mistake over and over and over
[00:55:45] again and so by keeping your situation
[00:55:48] and context in mind that tells you how
[00:55:52] often you should be creating schedules
[00:55:54] and how often you should be reflecting
[00:55:56] and how often you should be reexamining
[00:55:58] your priorities I can remember like
[00:56:00] certain periods of my life where things
[00:56:02] were really really busy like uh a couple
[00:56:05] years ago when I was going through India
[00:56:07] and traveling India I was managing my
[00:56:09] team in Australia full-time while also
[00:56:12] doing workshops and traveling around in
[00:56:14] India fulltime so I was working like 19h
[00:56:17] hour days and things were changing for
[00:56:20] me like every 2 to 3 hours so I would be
[00:56:24] re prioritizing and resched in my day
[00:56:27] like three four times a day because it
[00:56:30] was just a very very hectic month it was
[00:56:32] very challenging definitely not
[00:56:34] sustainable but I was able to stay on
[00:56:36] top of things because I changed my
[00:56:38] frequency of prioritization and
[00:56:40] scheduling based on my post of how
[00:56:43] quickly things are changing number 20
[00:56:46] learn time blocking versus time
[00:56:50] boxing if you go and watch like anyone's
[00:56:54] video on like their top 10 in
[00:56:56] productivity hacks time blocking is
[00:56:58] going to make it onto that list and it
[00:56:59] may even be number one in fact some
[00:57:01] people this is the only productivity
[00:57:03] advice that they have to give is to do
[00:57:05] time blocking I have it very very late
[00:57:07] into this video and that's for a good
[00:57:09] reason time blocking will not work for
[00:57:12] you to make you more productive if you
[00:57:14] don't do all the other things that I've
[00:57:16] already talked about that's not where
[00:57:18] the money is at for most people most
[00:57:20] people who struggle with their
[00:57:22] productivity don't struggle because of a
[00:57:24] lack of time blocking or time boxing but
[00:57:28] if you can do all the other things
[00:57:29] correct then this becomes really
[00:57:32] valuable so what is time boxing and time
[00:57:34] blocking it's very simple time blocking
[00:57:38] is literally taking a schedule putting a
[00:57:41] block of time in your day where you say
[00:57:44] I'm going to do something there that's
[00:57:46] it it could be studying like study block
[00:57:49] boom one p.m. to 300 p.m. studying
[00:57:51] that's my time block that's it it's just
[00:57:53] organizing your day into blocks of time
[00:57:56] when people say make a schedule they're
[00:57:59] basically saying do time
[00:58:02] blocking what's time
[00:58:05] boxing time boxing is almost the exact
[00:58:09] same thing you're still creating these
[00:58:10] blocks of time throughout the day the
[00:58:13] difference is the Box never changes a
[00:58:18] block is
[00:58:20] flexible so if you said I'm going to
[00:58:22] study between 1: to 300 p.m. but you
[00:58:25] just just kind of not finished at 30000
[00:58:27] p.m. and you've got like 20 30 minutes
[00:58:29] more to go it's a good idea if you can
[00:58:32] to just stretch it out to 30 more
[00:58:34] minutes because you can finish it off
[00:58:35] like that task is done like you're
[00:58:36] getting more value out of that so time
[00:58:38] blocking inherently has a level of
[00:58:40] flexibility built into it time boxing
[00:58:43] does not time boxing means 1 to 3 p.m.
[00:58:44] at 3 p.m. you stop so there are certain
[00:58:47] tasks and this is the key where time
[00:58:50] boxing is actually better for than time
[00:58:53] blocking so what kind of time asks would
[00:58:56] it be better for you to just immediately
[00:59:00] stop as soon as a Time runs out even if
[00:59:03] you haven't made as much progress as you
[00:59:05] initially plann to why would you ever
[00:59:07] want to do that number 21 distinguish
[00:59:12] urgent from important again our brain
[00:59:16] sabotages us a little bit because when
[00:59:19] you think of an important task to do
[00:59:22] often what you're thinking of is
[00:59:24] actually an urgent task to do
[00:59:26] so our brain is very very bad at
[00:59:29] assessing importance of anything that's
[00:59:33] long-term and it places a heavy bias of
[00:59:36] importance on things that have
[00:59:38] short-term consequences even if those
[00:59:41] consequences aren't particularly
[00:59:43] substantial uh the bigest example that I
[00:59:45] give to my school students is homework
[00:59:49] homework is due the next day I have to
[00:59:51] do it today it's urgent so when I say
[00:59:53] what's the most important thing for you
[00:59:54] to do today it's like I need to do do my
[00:59:56] homework here's a way to check whether
[00:59:58] it's really important what happens if
[01:00:01] you don't do it now different schools
[01:00:03] different rules but for some students
[01:00:06] it's like if I don't do my homework my
[01:00:09] teacher gets upset at
[01:00:11] me that's it it's
[01:00:14] like you know it seems like there could
[01:00:16] be worse things in life uh it doesn't
[01:00:18] seem like a huge consequence it's like
[01:00:20] but then I'll feel bad it's like but can
[01:00:21] you just deal with that just try to feel
[01:00:24] better like it's not a really big
[01:00:27] problem uh but there are certain things
[01:00:31] where there is no urgency but it could
[01:00:34] be lifechanging important but we
[01:00:37] absolutely cannot feel it emotionally it
[01:00:40] doesn't feel important and actually I've
[01:00:41] got a great story for this so one of my
[01:00:45] students um is a marine biologist and
[01:00:50] she for a very long time was interested
[01:00:52] in learning French because she always
[01:00:54] wanted to do Marine biology work around
[01:00:57] France and she obviously she needs to
[01:00:59] speak French to do that and so she
[01:01:01] started learning French 2 years in
[01:01:04] advance she didn't have any job
[01:01:05] opportunities lined up but she knew that
[01:01:07] that's where she wanted to go and that
[01:01:09] at some point someone's going to ask her
[01:01:12] can you speak French and at that point
[01:01:15] it becomes urgent so if she decides to
[01:01:17] be like uh I can learn how to speak
[01:01:21] French that opportunity is gone so she
[01:01:24] before it was urgent
[01:01:26] decided to make the lifechanging
[01:01:29] decision to spend a little bit of time
[01:01:32] every single day learning French and
[01:01:34] then after two years she developed a
[01:01:36] very high level of fluency and yes she
[01:01:38] did manage to get us a position as a
[01:01:41] marine biologist working in France
[01:01:42] because of that that's a great example
[01:01:45] and there are a lot of these things
[01:01:46] where it's not urgent right now if you
[01:01:49] did this thing it doesn't make a
[01:01:50] difference to you right now but at some
[01:01:53] point it's going to matter at some point
[01:01:55] you're going to need this skill or
[01:01:58] attribute that takes months or years to
[01:02:00] develop and you have either developed it
[01:02:02] or you haven't and if you have an
[01:02:05] opportunity is available to you and if
[01:02:06] you haven't then it's not and that is
[01:02:08] the type of thing that you can't get
[01:02:10] through working an urgency so it's very
[01:02:12] important that we actively learn to
[01:02:15] separate something that is urgent versus
[01:02:17] something that is important because the
[01:02:19] consequences and the impact that has on
[01:02:21] our lives are significant and then the
[01:02:24] ones that are really really like the
[01:02:26] peak of importance which is they're both
[01:02:27] urgent and important if this is sounding
[01:02:30] familiar to you this is from the
[01:02:31] Eisenhower Matrix which uh breaks up
[01:02:34] task into the quadrants of urgent versus
[01:02:36] important you can look up the Eisenhower
[01:02:38] Matrix a little bit more and ironically
[01:02:40] like learning to be more productive in
[01:02:42] this video is one of those things where
[01:02:44] it's going to take you time to learn to
[01:02:46] be more productive and so the time it
[01:02:49] takes for you to learn to be more
[01:02:51] productive is actually taking away from
[01:02:54] your immediate current urgent
[01:02:58] productivity but learning to be more
[01:03:00] productive can be life-changing and that
[01:03:02] is exactly the type of task that you
[01:03:05] want to time box an important but not
[01:03:10] urgent task is perfect for time boxing
[01:03:14] this is where you have on your schedule
[01:03:16] so let's say a Saturday afternoon is a
[01:03:19] good time for you Saturday afternoon 1:
[01:03:23] to 2:30 p.m. you block out an hour and a
[01:03:26] half to work on something that is
[01:03:29] important potentially life-changing but
[01:03:31] not urgent this is going to shift the
[01:03:33] needle for you in the future and you're
[01:03:36] going to just do a little bit of the
[01:03:37] work now every single week you just put
[01:03:39] aside a little bit of time now whether
[01:03:41] you do one hour a week versus 1 and a
[01:03:43] half hours a week does that really
[01:03:45] matter not really the most important
[01:03:48] thing is that the ball is rolling you're
[01:03:50] spending time week after week to work on
[01:03:53] this thing and that's where time boxing
[01:03:54] comes in it's it's not eating away into
[01:03:57] anything that might be urgent that you
[01:03:59] do need to get done or like urgent and
[01:04:01] important but it's also reserving time
[01:04:04] that you can protect for the things that
[01:04:06] you know are going to be life-changing
[01:04:09] like learning to be productive or
[01:04:10] learning to learn and the
[01:04:12] counterintuitive tip here is that when
[01:04:15] you're scheduling your week you should
[01:04:17] actually be scheduling the important
[01:04:19] nonurgent time box first you actually
[01:04:24] protect and block knock out that time
[01:04:27] first on the thing that you know is
[01:04:29] going to be life-changing for you
[01:04:30] eventually before you fill the rest of
[01:04:33] your time with the things that are a
[01:04:34] little bit more urgent because if you do
[01:04:35] it in reverse you'll find you never have
[01:04:37] time for that thing you want to learn
[01:04:39] French you never have time to learn
[01:04:41] French right but if you block it out
[01:04:43] first and you protect it now You' have
[01:04:46] made time and everything else you have
[01:04:48] to make it fit but we realize that this
[01:04:51] is a thing that changes things for us
[01:04:53] massively for a lot of people uh like in
[01:04:55] University or that are studying learning
[01:04:57] to learn is that you block out couple
[01:05:00] hours a week learning to learn but you
[01:05:03] might say I'm so busy with studying I
[01:05:05] don't have time for that if you're so
[01:05:08] busy with studying that you don't have 2
[01:05:10] hours a week you need to spend 2 hours a
[01:05:13] week to learn to study more efficiently
[01:05:16] which brings me to point number
[01:05:18] 22 sharpen the axe often here's how the
[01:05:23] old saying goes you've got two people
[01:05:25] cutting down trees one person cuts down
[01:05:27] trees for 10 hours they make a pile of
[01:05:29] logs the second person cuts down trees
[01:05:32] for 6 hours and makes a pile of logs
[01:05:35] bigger than the first person the first
[01:05:37] person is shocked they say hey what did
[01:05:39] you do in those 4 hours where you
[01:05:42] weren't cutting down trees to be able to
[01:05:44] cut down more than I did and the second
[01:05:47] person says sharpening the Axe by
[01:05:50] sharpening the axe it means you get more
[01:05:52] done and less here's the tricky part
[01:05:55] when do you know that you need to
[01:05:58] sharpen the axe and what axe do you need
[01:06:03] to sharpen because there's so many
[01:06:04] things that you can work on well you got
[01:06:06] to look for where you're spending the
[01:06:09] most amount of time to get the least
[01:06:12] predictable least consistent returns if
[01:06:16] you're using a blunt ax what can you
[01:06:19] expect you're going to be swinging for
[01:06:21] hours and hours at a tree making
[01:06:24] incremental tiny progress calluses on
[01:06:27] your hands bleeding everywhere thumbs
[01:06:31] broken you know like shoulder dislocated
[01:06:35] you know your Blood Sweat and Tears into
[01:06:37] this thing for medium returns for a lot
[01:06:41] of people that thing is studying hours
[01:06:43] and hours and hours every single day
[01:06:45] studying just to fall behind even more
[01:06:49] these are the things where it's an
[01:06:51] indicator like it's telling you like you
[01:06:53] can see I am doing a lot for not very
[01:06:55] very much that's the ax that needs to be
[01:06:58] sharpened that's where the money is
[01:07:00] going to be at that's su's law so if you
[01:07:03] want to dive a little deeper into some
[01:07:05] of the more nuanced productivity tips
[01:07:08] then I do have a free Weekly Newsletter
[01:07:11] that you can sign up to the links in the
[01:07:13] description I'll send you a email every
[01:07:15] single week into your inbox with more of
[01:07:19] this quite practical advice on the other
[01:07:21] hand if you really serious about
[01:07:23] leveling up your productivity and
[01:07:25] learning skills without the years of
[01:07:28] trial and error that it took me then you
[01:07:31] might want to check out my learning
[01:07:33] program at I can study.com and unlike on
[01:07:35] YouTube where every video kind of sits
[01:07:38] by itself on my program I'm able to
[01:07:41] really go deep and create a stepbystep
[01:07:44] framework for building a entire learning
[01:07:47] and productivity system so all of those

=== How To Be So Productive That It Feels ILLEGAL ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FXScrmYKQ0

[00:00:00] in this video I'm going to show you how
[00:00:01] you can be so productive and get so much
[00:00:04] done in a single day that it feels
[00:00:06] illegal I'll do this by sharing three
[00:00:09] powerful productivity principles that
[00:00:11] helped me to unlock this illegal level
[00:00:14] of productivity in my time in mid school
[00:00:16] as well as helping me rank first for my
[00:00:18] postgrad studies now these principles
[00:00:20] have worked not only for me but for
[00:00:22] thousands of Learners that I've taught
[00:00:24] this to from around the world so they
[00:00:27] will work for you too these three
[00:00:29] principles are number one the parto
[00:00:34] principal number two the Zar niik effect
[00:00:39] and number three the
[00:00:42] championship mentality and as a bonus
[00:00:45] I'll also teach you a way to supercharge
[00:00:47] each of these three principles and use
[00:00:50] them in a way that I have never heard
[00:00:53] anyone else on YouTube talk about so
[00:00:55] let's start with number one the Paro
[00:00:57] principle in my first year of University
[00:00:59] when I was trying to enter into mid
[00:01:00] school I was studying 15 to 20 hours
[00:01:04] every single day and a lot of that time
[00:01:06] was spent on doing my flash cards I had
[00:01:09] by the end of the year over 4,000 flash
[00:01:11] cards for my papers and I would be
[00:01:14] spending five six hours every single day
[00:01:17] either preparing my flashcards or doing
[00:01:20] my flash cards I had this Google sheet
[00:01:21] that had all the questions on it and I
[00:01:23] would track how difficult I found it and
[00:01:26] then how many times I got it wrong and
[00:01:27] what priority it was and I had this sort
[00:01:29] of a elaborate system that I'd created
[00:01:31] for managing my flash cards but at the
[00:01:32] end of the day I found that my results
[00:01:35] were still not that consistent I was
[00:01:37] still having to study a lot of hours
[00:01:39] just to get the grades that I got and
[00:01:41] when I actually entered into medical
[00:01:43] school that system was just completely
[00:01:45] unsustainable because the workload was 2
[00:01:47] three four times what it was before and
[00:01:51] the moral of the story here is that at
[00:01:52] the end of the day it still wasn't
[00:01:56] enough and the reason is because what I
[00:01:58] was focusing in spending my time on
[00:02:01] which was just optimizing my flash cards
[00:02:03] wasn't the thing that was going to make
[00:02:05] the biggest difference and this is
[00:02:06] really what the PTO principle is about
[00:02:09] sometimes it's called the 8020
[00:02:13] Rule and the idea is that
[00:02:16] 80% of the benefit or the impact of
[00:02:20] something can come from 20% of the time
[00:02:25] or effort or work and when you focus
[00:02:27] your time and attention on the other
[00:02:30] side the 80% of things that produce 20%
[00:02:33] of the impact it leads to a lot of waste
[00:02:35] of time a lot of frustration it's very
[00:02:38] annoying and it's very stressful and
[00:02:40] that's really how I felt during those
[00:02:42] first couple of years and I think a
[00:02:44] great example to illustrate the par
[00:02:46] principle is if you think about your
[00:02:47] health there are so many things that you
[00:02:49] can do to optimize your health like the
[00:02:52] amount that you sleep uh what you're
[00:02:55] drinking how often you're drinking what
[00:02:57] foods you're eating the specific micro
[00:02:59] macronutrients balance you have the type
[00:03:01] of exercise the frequency of your
[00:03:03] exercise you know the way that you
[00:03:04] support yourself in recovery after the
[00:03:06] exercise uh you know you can take
[00:03:08] additional like supplements and you can
[00:03:09] do meditation this list is so exhaustive
[00:03:12] like that's the entire industry right
[00:03:15] but really if you just get 20% of those
[00:03:20] things right like if you have good sleep
[00:03:22] you're drinking and you're eating
[00:03:24] reasonably well and maybe you're doing
[00:03:26] some kind of light exercise it doesn't
[00:03:28] matter the frequency exactly what you're
[00:03:29] doing just do something sometimes you're
[00:03:32] 80% going to be there to being pretty
[00:03:36] healthy and and feeling really good
[00:03:37] about yourself and when you focus on the
[00:03:41] other 80% of the things like you can
[00:03:42] take every supplement there is off the
[00:03:45] shelf but if you're not getting that 20%
[00:03:47] right and your sleep is not good and
[00:03:49] you're not you're not you're not
[00:03:50] drinking regularly then you're going to
[00:03:53] suffer like it doesn't matter what the
[00:03:55] other 80% is and so this is really
[00:03:57] important when it comes to productivity
[00:03:58] because productivity is all about how
[00:04:01] you manage limited resources the number
[00:04:02] one resource that's limited being your
[00:04:04] time you have the same number of hours
[00:04:08] in a day as Leonardo da Vinci and
[00:04:10] Michelangelo did and so figuring out
[00:04:13] what's worth doing and what's not worth
[00:04:16] doing is really the key and I think a
[00:04:19] powerful way of thinking about the spro
[00:04:20] principle is not that 20% of the things
[00:04:23] you do contribute to 80% of the results
[00:04:25] but it's an understanding if you have a
[00:04:27] list of 10 things that you need to get
[00:04:30] done what it means is that eight of
[00:04:34] those 10 things are essentially going to
[00:04:37] be a waste of time compared to figuring
[00:04:40] out what the two that really make the
[00:04:43] most impact are and then spending your
[00:04:45] time absolutely crushing those and I
[00:04:47] think of the Paro Principle as the
[00:04:49] fundamental pillar of all productivity
[00:04:52] because the impact that the Paro
[00:04:54] principle has is it allows you to stack
[00:04:57] your gains so I want you to imagine that
[00:05:00] this circle represents you and then this
[00:05:03] uh cross represents the goal that you
[00:05:05] want to
[00:05:06] achieve when we just do everything and
[00:05:10] we don't strictly prioritize exactly
[00:05:13] where we want to spend our time and
[00:05:14] what's going to help us get 80% of the
[00:05:16] way to our goal we end up doing
[00:05:19] this we spend a lot of time doing lots
[00:05:22] of things moving in many different
[00:05:25] directions and at the end of the day
[00:05:27] despite being very busy we're still not
[00:05:29] very close to our
[00:05:31] goal once we use the pral principle what
[00:05:35] happens is that we figure out what the
[00:05:38] things are that take us towards the goal
[00:05:41] and it means in the same amount of time
[00:05:43] or effort or even less we're able to
[00:05:46] achieve our goal now when you look at
[00:05:49] someone that's using the Paro principle
[00:05:51] day in day out in their life and you see
[00:05:53] someone living like this this is the
[00:05:56] type of person you look at and you think
[00:05:58] man this person is focused
[00:06:00] this person has Clarity this person
[00:06:02] knows the direction they're going
[00:06:04] everything for them feels like it's all
[00:06:05] laid out you can see that they're moving
[00:06:07] purposefully towards your goal and you
[00:06:09] wonder how it is that they make it look
[00:06:11] so easy to get so much done and be so
[00:06:14] productive while you are just
[00:06:16] squandering and when you look at the
[00:06:18] person that is doing this they're not
[00:06:20] using the Proto principle they're
[00:06:21] spending their time across the entire
[00:06:24] 100% then they're very very busy they
[00:06:27] are floundering their person just
[00:06:29] treading water you can see they are
[00:06:31] flustered they're not you know
[00:06:33] potentially they're falling behind and
[00:06:35] despite being so busy they are wondering
[00:06:38] why they don't seem to be getting any
[00:06:40] closer to the goal so here's the key
[00:06:41] takeaway for using the parto principle
[00:06:44] the first thing is to actually spend
[00:06:46] time planning and prioritizing upfront
[00:06:50] if you're really busy and you feel like
[00:06:52] you don't have enough time to plan and
[00:06:54] prioritize or use the Paro principle and
[00:06:56] figure out what is that 20% that
[00:06:58] produces the impact
[00:07:00] then let me tell you this if planning is
[00:07:03] costly not planning is more costly
[00:07:06] nothing is going to kill your
[00:07:07] productivity more than spending time on
[00:07:10] things that are a waste of time but you
[00:07:13] have to spend the time upfront to figure
[00:07:16] out what is or is not a waste of time
[00:07:19] and this is the second takeaway is that
[00:07:22] good
[00:07:26] prioritization
[00:07:27] feels bad
[00:07:30] here's a part that most people Overlook
[00:07:32] if you've got a list of things to do the
[00:07:35] items that make it onto your Todo list
[00:07:38] are already fairly important if someone
[00:07:41] says hey have you ever thought about
[00:07:43] learning how you can juggle flaming
[00:07:46] swords riding a unicycle while making an
[00:07:50] origami crane using your tongue then you
[00:07:53] might say no I've never thought about
[00:07:56] doing that and I'm probably never going
[00:07:58] to think about doing that
[00:08:00] and unless your future career path is
[00:08:03] that of a very Niche circus performer
[00:08:06] that item is never going to be important
[00:08:08] enough to be on your to-do list
[00:08:11] everything that's on our to-do list has
[00:08:12] already been filtered and shortlisted
[00:08:14] out and we have made the decision this
[00:08:16] is important enough for me to do so what
[00:08:19] that means is that when you go through
[00:08:20] and figure out the 80% of the things
[00:08:22] that are not really getting you towards
[00:08:25] your goal that are making the biggest
[00:08:27] impact out of all the other things that
[00:08:29] you could be doing it's going to feel
[00:08:31] bad to take them off your list because
[00:08:34] you are acutely aware of what you are
[00:08:37] losing by not doing this I am losing out
[00:08:41] on this and that feels bad and so I want
[00:08:44] to normalize and let you know that when
[00:08:47] you're prioritizing well it should feel
[00:08:50] bad because that means you're making the
[00:08:52] difficult decisions about what you're
[00:08:54] willing to lose strategically that helps
[00:08:57] you spend the time in the way that gets
[00:08:59] you you to your goal and my final point
[00:09:01] is to think
[00:09:03] holistically productivity is not just
[00:09:06] about doing work or studying or planning
[00:09:10] prioritization is about everything you
[00:09:12] spend your time on and that means taking
[00:09:15] a break spending time with loved ones
[00:09:19] engaging in your hobbies getting good
[00:09:20] sleep these are all things that help
[00:09:23] sustain and rejuvenate you productivity
[00:09:26] is anything that helps you get towards
[00:09:29] your goal and if you're 3 weeks into to
[00:09:33] a Sprint of not having had any breaks
[00:09:36] and you've just been studying and
[00:09:38] working the entire time and you're
[00:09:40] feeling like you're burning out then the
[00:09:42] thing that is going to get in the way of
[00:09:43] you achieving your goal is the fact that
[00:09:46] you're burning out or that you're too
[00:09:47] tired and so choosing to ignore
[00:09:51] self-care and Recovery is an incredibly
[00:09:54] unproductive decision and again making
[00:09:57] that decision can feel bad because it's
[00:09:59] not clearing my backlog of work and
[00:10:02] study that I need to do I'm just sitting
[00:10:04] there resting wasting time but you have
[00:10:08] to recognize it's not a waste of time
[00:10:09] it's actually very productive and so if
[00:10:11] you just use this principle just the
[00:10:13] parto Principle as I've told you and
[00:10:16] nothing else already for a lot of you
[00:10:19] this is going to two to 3x your
[00:10:21] productivity pretty much immediately but
[00:10:24] now I'll tell you how you can
[00:10:25] supercharge this in a way that no one
[00:10:28] really talks about and just to be clear
[00:10:32] it's the supercharging of this that
[00:10:34] makes this feel illegal we can turn the
[00:10:37] Paro principle into the
[00:10:40] parto squared
[00:10:43] principle what this means is that you
[00:10:45] can actually apply the Paro principle to
[00:10:48] itself so let's say that of this list of
[00:10:51] 10 items here we figured out the two
[00:10:54] that get us towards our goal in the in
[00:10:57] the highest possible impact well if we
[00:10:59] were to take those two and we were to
[00:11:02] break them up we' find that these two
[00:11:04] tasks have components to it so let's
[00:11:08] just say that each of these tasks have
[00:11:10] five
[00:11:11] components well of these five components
[00:11:14] or subtasks that make up the two major
[00:11:19] tasks 20% of these will contribute 80%
[00:11:22] of the impact so let me say for example
[00:11:25] writing an essay is the major task well
[00:11:29] if we break up this process of writing
[00:11:31] an essay we might find that first we
[00:11:33] need to think of a plan uh we need to be
[00:11:36] clear on the objectives of the essay we
[00:11:39] need to write the main points we need to
[00:11:41] then draft them and then we need to
[00:11:43] refine it let's say that that's your
[00:11:46] process for writing an essay well of
[00:11:49] this your initial first step the
[00:11:52] planning is the thing that's going to
[00:11:54] make your essay the best whatever you
[00:11:56] plan affects what you write and how you
[00:11:58] draft it and so if there's areas in your
[00:12:00] planning those areas get carried forward
[00:12:01] or a common one is if there's a big
[00:12:03] decision that you need to make well one
[00:12:06] of the things that helps you make a
[00:12:08] really good decision is just having more
[00:12:10] information to make a good decision so
[00:12:12] just the first step of collecting more
[00:12:14] information or even writing down the
[00:12:17] things you need more information about
[00:12:20] that would help you make a better
[00:12:21] decision that is the 20% that helps you
[00:12:24] with the remaining 80% and so by using
[00:12:27] not just the Paro principle but the
[00:12:29] protos squared principle the additional
[00:12:32] benefits this gives is that first of all
[00:12:34] this actually reduces your
[00:12:37] procrastination because the task that
[00:12:39] you're focusing on is no longer this
[00:12:41] huge big overwhelming task you're
[00:12:43] focusing on this tiny first initial step
[00:12:46] and number two because you're
[00:12:48] prioritizing it so strictly it also
[00:12:51] increases your success
[00:12:53] rate by focusing on the most important
[00:12:57] part of a task it ures that you're doing
[00:13:00] the most important part to a high
[00:13:02] quality and once you do this part the
[00:13:05] rest of it becomes much easier which
[00:13:07] again reduces procrastination even more
[00:13:10] and so the takeaway for the predo
[00:13:12] squared principle is to spend even more
[00:13:16] time by figuring out the 20% of the 20%
[00:13:19] to identify your most most important
[00:13:22] task and by the way for those of you
[00:13:24] that are interested if you do the maths
[00:13:26] on the PTO squid principle what that
[00:13:27] works out to is 4% of your time being
[00:13:31] used to create
[00:13:34] 64% of the total impact towards your
[00:13:36] goal and if you compare someone that's
[00:13:38] not using these principles which is this
[00:13:41] this guy here and you compare yourself
[00:13:43] to this person who's using all of their
[00:13:46] time doing all of their tasks what this
[00:13:49] person is able to achieve in two 2 and 1
[00:13:52] half months you can do by the end of the
[00:13:55] week that is what the PTO squ principle
[00:13:58] unlocks by the way if your goal is to be
[00:14:00] more productive then one of the highest
[00:14:02] priority tasks one of the 4% of things
[00:14:05] that produce the Major Impact is to
[00:14:08] create a learning system learning is the
[00:14:11] Mega skill it's the tide that lifts all
[00:14:13] boats it's the it's the wish for more
[00:14:16] wishes when you become a better learner
[00:14:19] every skill becomes easier to learn and
[00:14:21] you become more productive and to help
[00:14:23] you become a better learner I've created
[00:14:25] a free learning system assessment for
[00:14:27] you this quiz evaluates your current
[00:14:29] learning system and it gives you a score
[00:14:31] out of 100 based on its Effectiveness
[00:14:34] more importantly you also get a
[00:14:35] personalized report that tells you which
[00:14:37] parts of your learning system are
[00:14:39] holding you back it basically tells you
[00:14:42] exactly what is the 20% in your learning
[00:14:46] that if you were to improve gives you
[00:14:48] 80% of the results I highly recommend
[00:14:50] giving it a go and it is free I'll leave
[00:14:52] a link to it in the description below so
[00:14:55] the first thing was the Paro principle
[00:14:57] and that helps you to prioritize your
[00:14:58] task s but once you've got your 20% or
[00:15:01] your 4% the other issue we run into is
[00:15:05] procrastination there's no point
[00:15:07] prioritizing the 4% if you never
[00:15:08] actually do it fortunately this is where
[00:15:12] the second pillar comes in and this is
[00:15:14] called the zaric effect and I probably
[00:15:17] use the zaric effect every single day
[00:15:20] after my fifth year of medical school I
[00:15:22] decided to take a year of doing honors
[00:15:24] research and so this was my first time
[00:15:27] doing my own research and the first part
[00:15:30] of doing research is what's called a
[00:15:31] literature review which is where you're
[00:15:33] reading through all the research within
[00:15:35] a field and then you're writing this big
[00:15:37] report based on it and I was starting
[00:15:41] this in the summer holidays I started
[00:15:43] off really enthusiastic and really
[00:15:45] really Keen but because I'd never really
[00:15:48] written such a lengthy literature review
[00:15:51] before and it was a topic that I
[00:15:53] honestly wasn't that interested in I
[00:15:56] found myself putting it off and
[00:15:57] procrastinating on it for weeks in fact
[00:15:59] it got so bad that after the first month
[00:16:03] where I hadn't done anything my
[00:16:05] supervisor actually emailed me to say
[00:16:07] like hey Justin are you still keen on
[00:16:10] this project because you seemed really
[00:16:12] enthusiastic but you actually haven't
[00:16:14] shown me anything and so I was like oh
[00:16:17] crap I need to produce something to show
[00:16:19] my supervisor and so for the next 3 days
[00:16:23] I really quickly got some stuff together
[00:16:27] that just makes it look like I've been
[00:16:30] working on things and then I sent it to
[00:16:33] her and what I found was that even
[00:16:37] though I wasn't doing the literature
[00:16:39] review properly and I was just creating
[00:16:42] something to send to my supervisor the
[00:16:44] very fact that I started on this process
[00:16:48] made me feel more motivated to keep
[00:16:51] going with it and so the next day I did
[00:16:53] more and more and more and more and more
[00:16:55] until eventually I'd actually just done
[00:16:57] the entire literature review and so it
[00:16:59] was just that first step as we all know
[00:17:02] that helps to break procrastination and
[00:17:04] this is what the zga neck effect is
[00:17:06] about the zga neck effect says that a
[00:17:10] task is easier to complete when it is
[00:17:14] left incomplete the idea is that when
[00:17:16] there's this incomplete task we want to
[00:17:19] finish it off it stays in our head it
[00:17:21] occupies that space we know we've got
[00:17:23] the ball rolling we want to finish it
[00:17:25] that completionist tendency of us comes
[00:17:27] out and so if we deliberate
[00:17:29] start a task not intending to complete
[00:17:32] it and rather we want to start it and
[00:17:36] leave it in an incomplete State then
[00:17:39] this actually improves our
[00:17:42] motivation it reduces the amount of
[00:17:45] friction that we feel with starting the
[00:17:47] task because we know we don't have to
[00:17:48] finish it we just need to get started
[00:17:50] and you know getting started is frankly
[00:17:53] very easy if you don't care about
[00:17:54] finishing it and therefore the reduced
[00:17:57] friction reduces our procrastination
[00:17:59] and so the takeaway to using the zga
[00:18:01] Nick effect is to understand the wi
[00:18:04] condition for curing
[00:18:07] procrastination the win condition is not
[00:18:09] finishing the task your win condition is
[00:18:13] getting the task to a state where it's
[00:18:16] incomplete we should never think about a
[00:18:18] task as completing the task we should
[00:18:21] think about tasks as leaving them
[00:18:24] unfinished and if you're using the PTO
[00:18:26] principle or the PTO squar principle
[00:18:28] then we already took the time upfront to
[00:18:31] identify what is that task or subtask
[00:18:35] that if we were to focus on produces 80%
[00:18:39] of the result and that item becomes a
[00:18:42] thing that we just get started on and
[00:18:44] use the zga Nick effect for now pero
[00:18:47] Square principle plus zga Nick effect
[00:18:50] your productivity is already at this
[00:18:52] point through the roof but sky's the
[00:18:54] limit hey so here's how you can
[00:18:57] supercharge the zga effect to make it
[00:19:00] feel like it should be illegal and this
[00:19:02] is what I call the zonic squared
[00:19:09] effect just like we did with the Paro
[00:19:12] principle you can use the zonic effect
[00:19:14] on itself and this is by recognizing
[00:19:17] that the idea of getting started on a
[00:19:20] task actually has many substeps to it
[00:19:24] for example if the task I want to get
[00:19:25] started on is sitting down to study or
[00:19:29] plan my essay then before that I need to
[00:19:32] be at my desk and I need to have all my
[00:19:35] books and my resources out available to
[00:19:37] me and I need to have uh let's say an
[00:19:41] organized space and I need to have do
[00:19:44] not disturb activated on my phone and so
[00:19:48] you can actually get started on getting
[00:19:52] started with organizing your space
[00:19:54] getting your books and everything ready
[00:19:56] laying them out on your desk so that the
[00:19:58] only thing left to properly get started
[00:20:03] is to just sit down and start and here's
[00:20:05] a bonus tip if you really struggle with
[00:20:07] procrastination with something you can
[00:20:09] actually use a reverse zonic squared
[00:20:13] effect you can make it really hard to
[00:20:16] get started on something that you would
[00:20:19] normally get procrastinated with so I
[00:20:21] used to be a big gamer and one of the
[00:20:24] things that I changed is I went from
[00:20:26] having this big gaming PC
[00:20:29] uh to a
[00:20:30] Macbook and I only had one monitor at
[00:20:33] the time and so I would plug my monitor
[00:20:37] into my MacBook which didn't have any
[00:20:39] games on it I just used it for work and
[00:20:41] so my computer would end up being
[00:20:44] unplugged for my monitor I went from
[00:20:47] gaming like hours and hours and hours
[00:20:50] like a day to gaming like couple hours a
[00:20:54] week because I just couldn't be bothered
[00:20:57] unplugging my monitor from my MacBook
[00:21:00] crawling under my desk opening up the
[00:21:03] panel in the back of my PC and like
[00:21:05] fiddling around to connect my HDMI cable
[00:21:08] and turning my PC on like I just I was
[00:21:10] so lazy and I couldn't be bothered it
[00:21:12] was so hard to get started with the
[00:21:15] distraction that I just didn't and the
[00:21:17] awesome thing is now with AI and other
[00:21:20] types of like automations and Technology
[00:21:22] we can make the aonic effect even easier
[00:21:25] by automating some of these things so
[00:21:27] for example let's say that when we're
[00:21:29] trying to plan an essay we want to get
[00:21:31] some initial first points down we want
[00:21:34] to think about some possible structures
[00:21:36] we want to check some of the resources
[00:21:38] well we can use something like chbt to
[00:21:41] just generate some points and some
[00:21:42] structures for us to start with it's
[00:21:44] like being given a running start on the
[00:21:46] task for free you can also set up
[00:21:49] calendar reminders to remind you to set
[00:21:52] up your books and set up your desk or uh
[00:21:54] you can set up automatic do not disturb
[00:21:56] Focus periods on your phone so that
[00:21:58] automatically when you know you're meant
[00:22:00] to be studying you have your phone flick
[00:22:02] into a do not disturb mode and so what
[00:22:04] we're doing now is we're not just
[00:22:05] getting started with getting started but
[00:22:08] we are enabling our environment and our
[00:22:11] technology to get us started for us so
[00:22:16] the key takeaway for using the zga neck
[00:22:18] squared effect is to just keep breaking
[00:22:22] it down and make it easy now the third
[00:22:25] productivity pillar amplifies the impact
[00:22:27] of the first two the third one is the
[00:22:30] championship mentality and this can be
[00:22:32] summarized with a statement lose the
[00:22:35] game to win the championship and a great
[00:22:38] example of this is Toyota yeah like the
[00:22:40] car company now in the modern day Toyota
[00:22:43] is known for having really reliable cars
[00:22:46] but this was not always the case in the
[00:22:48] 50s and 60s Toyota used to produce very
[00:22:52] shy vehicles and so to fix this they
[00:22:55] actually slowed down their production
[00:22:58] proc they deliberately sacrificed their
[00:23:01] revenue and their profit they lost
[00:23:03] market share they sacrificed their
[00:23:05] volume in order to learn more about
[00:23:08] their production process they went into
[00:23:10] meticulous detail to figure out how they
[00:23:12] can improve and optimize their process
[00:23:15] before ramping Up the Volume again and
[00:23:17] the way Toyota improved their processes
[00:23:20] is actually like a business case that's
[00:23:22] taught in a lot of schools now and so
[00:23:24] the idea here is that again if if we are
[00:23:26] this circle and we're trying to reach
[00:23:28] this goal a lot of the time we don't
[00:23:30] actually know how to exactly achieve it
[00:23:35] it's difficult sometimes to figure out
[00:23:37] what is that 20% that produces the 80%
[00:23:40] impact because we don't know what our
[00:23:42] goal really truly requires of us and so
[00:23:45] what a lot of people will do is either
[00:23:47] just do a lot of stuff and just hope
[00:23:50] that it gets them towards their goal and
[00:23:52] that would be like just you
[00:23:54] know being really busy but not really
[00:23:57] being very productive again or they just
[00:24:00] do what's common and what other people
[00:24:01] say that they should do but this can be
[00:24:03] risky because what if they're wrong and
[00:24:06] so what the championship mindset tells
[00:24:08] us is that in order to achieve our
[00:24:12] ultimate goal we don't necessarily have
[00:24:15] to achieve every goal along the way and
[00:24:18] in fact it can be a better idea to not
[00:24:22] worry about beating and winning the next
[00:24:25] game in order for us to have a great
[00:24:28] chance at winning the championship so
[00:24:30] how does losing a game help us win a
[00:24:33] championship the answer is that by
[00:24:35] losing the game we are able to get
[00:24:38] valuable data and information that turns
[00:24:41] these unknowns into knowns and by doing
[00:24:44] that we're able to create a much better
[00:24:46] plan and prioritize and use the Paro
[00:24:49] principle more effectively I see this a
[00:24:52] lot when it comes to studying people
[00:24:55] might want to enter into a certain
[00:24:56] University degree or have this kind of
[00:24:59] long-term goal in place and they've got
[00:25:01] an exam coming up in one or two months
[00:25:04] they want to nail this exam so that they
[00:25:07] can achieve this ultimate goal but their
[00:25:10] study skills are a mess they have no
[00:25:12] idea what they're doing with their
[00:25:14] studying they have no real
[00:25:15] self-awareness or Insight they're not in
[00:25:17] a position where they can really succeed
[00:25:20] and so the best thing for this person to
[00:25:22] do would be to spend the next one or two
[00:25:25] months on really learning about learning
[00:25:28] understanding how to learn and how to
[00:25:29] study what their habits are what their
[00:25:31] Tendencies are experimenting with things
[00:25:33] and then building a learning system that
[00:25:35] really works that's going to be enough
[00:25:38] for them to win the
[00:25:39] championship but that might mean that
[00:25:43] you spend so much time on just improving
[00:25:46] your skills and learning about yourself
[00:25:48] that you actually fall behind on your
[00:25:50] actual studying in that short period of
[00:25:53] time so you might not do very well for
[00:25:55] that immediate exam now you'll end up
[00:25:58] crushing it in the next exam and the one
[00:26:00] after that and one after that and one
[00:26:01] after that but if you're so focused on
[00:26:04] just winning every individual game and
[00:26:06] what it's costing you is valuable
[00:26:09] learning and understanding and figuring
[00:26:12] out these uncertainties that help you to
[00:26:15] win the championship then you're
[00:26:17] actually setting yourself up for failure
[00:26:18] because at some point you're not going
[00:26:20] to be able to win that short-term game
[00:26:22] and now you're left with two problems
[00:26:24] number one you don't have the skills to
[00:26:27] win the champ chionship and number two
[00:26:30] because you've left it for so long you
[00:26:31] don't have enough time left to figure it
[00:26:34] out either now I'm not saying go and
[00:26:36] lose every single game and fail every
[00:26:37] single examp what I am saying is that
[00:26:39] sometimes to win the long game you need
[00:26:41] to be ready to lose the short one so
[00:26:44] here's my takeaway for you to use the
[00:26:46] championship mentality number one figure
[00:26:49] out what does a championship mean to you
[00:26:52] is it really the next test or exam or
[00:26:55] promotion coming up or is it something
[00:26:57] further than that and then number two
[00:26:59] figure out what is the consequence of
[00:27:02] losing the
[00:27:04] game what do losing this game really
[00:27:08] mean to you what's the consequence of it
[00:27:11] versus what are you giving up what's the
[00:27:13] opportunity cost what are you losing out
[00:27:15] on the opportunity for in order to just
[00:27:18] win this upcoming game have these two
[00:27:21] things really clear in your mind and
[00:27:23] revisit them once every month or so now
[00:27:26] here's the way that we can crack the
[00:27:28] Championship mentality to make it feel
[00:27:31] illegal so think about this the reason
[00:27:34] we are willing to accept the loss in the
[00:27:37] game short term is because that provides
[00:27:39] valuable information to figure out how
[00:27:41] to win
[00:27:43] longterm so if we think about the amount
[00:27:45] of certainty we have at being able to
[00:27:48] win here on the y- AIS this is our level
[00:27:51] of certainty in the beginning we start
[00:27:54] off with a very low level of certainty
[00:27:57] because we also have a very low level of
[00:28:01] information and then what happens is
[00:28:03] that as time passes we learn more about
[00:28:07] what it takes to achieve our goal we
[00:28:09] learn more about our Tendencies and our
[00:28:11] habits and our processes and we find a
[00:28:13] way to make it match but that takes time
[00:28:16] and so as time goes on our level of
[00:28:18] information starts going up and so too
[00:28:21] does our level of certainty about how we
[00:28:24] can succeed and how we can win so let's
[00:28:26] say that this blue line represent
[00:28:28] presents the point at which we have
[00:28:29] enough certainty to know how to win this
[00:28:32] is the line of
[00:28:34] winning but let's say that this uh
[00:28:36] dotted white line here this is when it
[00:28:43] matters what we don't want is we don't
[00:28:46] want this period of learning and gaining
[00:28:48] certainty to take so long that we
[00:28:51] actually missed the boat we already
[00:28:52] failed all of these goals and we look
[00:28:54] back and think ah I regret not doing
[00:28:56] things differently back then then that's
[00:28:58] the thing I should have done differently
[00:29:00] that's what we want to avoid and the way
[00:29:02] we supercharge this Championship
[00:29:04] mentality is realizing that this is
[00:29:08] wrong there's this great saying time
[00:29:11] changes nothing it's what you do in the
[00:29:14] time that matters sometimes I'll be
[00:29:16] talking to a student about the way that
[00:29:18] they're studying and I'll say okay you
[00:29:19] need to make these changes and this this
[00:29:21] Improvement that's what you really need
[00:29:22] to do to help you achieve this goal and
[00:29:25] they say okay that sounds interesting
[00:29:26] I'm just going to think about that for a
[00:29:28] little bit give me like a week to just
[00:29:29] think about what you've said and my
[00:29:31] question there is what's going to happen
[00:29:34] in that week are you are you spending
[00:29:36] this week to go onto a meditative
[00:29:38] Retreat light some incense over a fire
[00:29:41] look at the stars and tell you what you
[00:29:43] should be doing like there's this
[00:29:46] assumption that by sleeping on it and
[00:29:48] just time passing somehow it changes the
[00:29:51] decision that you're going to make but
[00:29:53] it doesn't at the end of the day what's
[00:29:55] going to happen is that a week is going
[00:29:56] to pass you're going to realize oh crap
[00:29:58] I need to meet up with Justin again
[00:30:00] tomorrow and you're going to do all the
[00:30:01] thinking the night before and you could
[00:30:03] just do that thinking immediately on the
[00:30:06] spot and when we realize that our
[00:30:10] ability to gain certainty and gain
[00:30:13] information or something doesn't depend
[00:30:15] on our time but depends on our
[00:30:18] actions this is where we change the game
[00:30:21] and we supercharge this and so while
[00:30:23] everyone else is waiting to figure out
[00:30:25] how they can succeed and what they need
[00:30:27] to do what the stry is for them to win
[00:30:29] just by letting time pass and sort of
[00:30:31] passively learning about what to do you
[00:30:33] can realize action is the thing that
[00:30:35] makes a difference and in the same
[00:30:37] amount of time you can take more
[00:30:40] actions the same number of actions the
[00:30:42] same amount of learning that someone
[00:30:43] would have originally gained across this
[00:30:46] period of time you can do it in this
[00:30:48] period of time which means that you able
[00:30:50] to get to a winning strategy much
[00:30:52] earlier than everyone else and again if
[00:30:54] I look at studying people make this
[00:30:56] mistake constantly where they'll say hey
[00:30:59] I'm going to do my best for this exam if
[00:31:01] it doesn't go well okay I'll learn from
[00:31:03] that what are you actually learning from
[00:31:06] that what was the experiment that you
[00:31:08] ran what is the data that you're getting
[00:31:10] from that mistake that really helps you
[00:31:12] and did you really need to wait 2 months
[00:31:15] studying a certain way sitting an exam
[00:31:17] failing that exam to realize that
[00:31:20] mistake could you instead have tried an
[00:31:23] experiment today tested yourself on that
[00:31:26] tomorrow to see the effect effect that
[00:31:28] it has and then iterated and
[00:31:30] experimented on a daily basis to get
[00:31:33] that same information or even more it's
[00:31:35] ironic because one of the most common
[00:31:38] pieces of feedback that I get from
[00:31:40] students on my program is they say if
[00:31:43] they're older they say I wish I learned
[00:31:45] this back when I was in school I wish I
[00:31:46] knew this 10 years ago it would have
[00:31:48] changed my life and then the most common
[00:31:50] thing I hear from people that are 10
[00:31:52] years ago that are in school in that
[00:31:55] place where they are currently actively
[00:31:57] making those mistakes is I'll try it
[00:32:00] later I don't really have time right now
[00:32:02] I'm too busy struggling right now to
[00:32:06] figure out how to do well but let me
[00:32:09] tell you if you don't make time to learn
[00:32:13] how to succeed that time will be made
[00:32:16] for you later through failure so
[00:32:19] takeaway is don't be passive don't just
[00:32:22] assume that the problems you have now
[00:32:24] will solve themselves if you're serious
[00:32:26] about gaining certain and achieving your
[00:32:29] goals and giving yourself the best
[00:32:30] chance of success take action do the
[00:32:34] things and make the time that other
[00:32:36] people are not making so that you can
[00:32:37] learn what other people are not learning
[00:32:39] so these are the three pillars of
[00:32:42] productivity that are going to help you
[00:32:44] get much more done and help you achieve
[00:32:46] your goal and here's another video that
[00:32:47] will help you to refine your learning
[00:32:49] system so that you can level up your
[00:32:51] productivity even more


=== How To Study And Learn (Full Masterclass) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNu-pEHvZd4

[00:00:00] I'm Dr Justin Sun I'm a former medical
[00:00:02] doctor and I've been a learning coach
[00:00:03] for the past 13 years I run a learning
[00:00:06] program called I can study which has
[00:00:08] helped tens of thousands of people from
[00:00:10] around the world learn to learn more
[00:00:12] efficiently and achieve their dream
[00:00:14] results and today we're discussing how
[00:00:17] to remember everything you read and
[00:00:20] learn so in this video I'll tell you
[00:00:21] what the scientific research says is the
[00:00:24] best way to learn but I'll also cover it
[00:00:26] from a more practical perspective and
[00:00:29] tell you what that research means for
[00:00:31] you my goal is that by the end of this
[00:00:33] video I want you to be able to
[00:00:35] understand the research on learning not
[00:00:36] like a researcher but in a way that
[00:00:39] allows you to understand how you learn
[00:00:42] and more importantly how you can improve
[00:00:44] to be a more confident and effective
[00:00:46] learner so today's discussion should be
[00:00:48] extremely helpful if you're in school at
[00:00:52] any stage of school or even if you're
[00:00:54] not in any formal education whether it's
[00:00:56] applying knowledge and learning for work
[00:00:59] or passion project s or something on the
[00:01:00] side any area of your life where you
[00:01:03] need to learn and apply new knowledge
[00:01:05] now before I dive into the research
[00:01:08] there are a couple of things that will
[00:01:10] probably surprise you about today's
[00:01:12] discussion first of all you'll realize
[00:01:15] pretty soon that most of what you know
[00:01:18] and think about learning is probably
[00:01:21] wrong or at least incomplete regardless
[00:01:24] of your level of achievement even if
[00:01:25] you're a top learner and what that means
[00:01:27] is that your idea of how to become a
[00:01:29] better learner and what that involves is
[00:01:33] probably not accurate and trust me I was
[00:01:36] in the same boat I was generally a
[00:01:39] pretty decent okay learner not the best
[00:01:44] but certainly not the worst when I
[00:01:46] entered into University I realized that
[00:01:49] the world is a big place and there are a
[00:01:51] lot of people that are much smarter than
[00:01:53] me I had to work really really hard I
[00:01:56] studied a lot and I ended up getting
[00:01:58] really really good grades and so when I
[00:02:01] entered into medical school and I was
[00:02:02] going through medical school trying to
[00:02:04] cover that enormous workload while
[00:02:08] working full-time at the same time
[00:02:09] learning about learning
[00:02:11] science I thought I would have a pretty
[00:02:15] good head start on most people I had
[00:02:18] good grades I thought about my learning
[00:02:20] I'd certainly experimented more with my
[00:02:22] learning than most people but as soon as
[00:02:24] I really dove into it boy was I wrong
[00:02:28] but it's the realiz you were wrong and
[00:02:31] realizing what is actually the truth
[00:02:34] that creates those breakthrough moments
[00:02:37] that means that you can create those big
[00:02:39] changes in your learning efficiency and
[00:02:41] in your overall ability to learn and
[00:02:42] I've been now doing this for over 13
[00:02:45] years and still every year there's new
[00:02:48] research that comes out there's new
[00:02:50] observations that I'll make in my own
[00:02:51] practice that teach me more about what
[00:02:53] it means to really become a great
[00:02:56] learner and one thing I really want to
[00:02:57] emphasize is that if you're new to this
[00:03:00] Journey on learning to learn or whether
[00:03:01] you have been following my channel and
[00:03:03] my work for a long time or maybe you're
[00:03:05] already even on my program you'll
[00:03:07] probably going to learn some new things
[00:03:10] in this video and don't beat yourself up
[00:03:12] over the fact that you didn't know this
[00:03:14] stuff even if you're a great learner
[00:03:16] don't think that it's an insult to your
[00:03:19] capability your or your ability to learn
[00:03:22] it's not your fault most of the stuff is
[00:03:24] not taught in any mainstream education
[00:03:27] now part of that is because there is a
[00:03:29] lot of research that's very insightful
[00:03:31] that's only come out recently and hasn't
[00:03:33] trickled down into the mainstream but
[00:03:36] even when it is taught I have seen many
[00:03:39] times that it is taught incorrectly
[00:03:42] usually even if they are saying it is
[00:03:44] evidence-based they haven't spent an
[00:03:47] extensive amount of time really looking
[00:03:49] through the research to understand it
[00:03:52] and I find that a lot of the common
[00:03:54] advice and recommendations and talk of
[00:03:56] learning research is just a rehash of
[00:03:59] the same things that everyone is saying
[00:04:02] I've even seen formal recommendations
[00:04:04] and advice given by universities on how
[00:04:07] to study and and how to learn that is
[00:04:10] outdated or inaccurate in fact there's
[00:04:12] even some research on this that shows
[00:04:15] that up to 98% of teacher training
[00:04:19] curriculums globally have scientifically
[00:04:23] outdated or inaccurate information and
[00:04:25] the stuff that does get talked about
[00:04:26] tends to focus on a very very narrow
[00:04:30] scope of the research and what that
[00:04:33] means the danger of that and why that
[00:04:35] matters to you is that it means that the
[00:04:38] way that we are used to thinking about
[00:04:39] learning and how to learn effectively
[00:04:41] and the advice that is so accessible to
[00:04:43] us makes us focus in a very narrow
[00:04:45] Direction and in my experience when you
[00:04:47] only focus in a narrow direction and you
[00:04:49] are ignoring all these other factors
[00:04:51] that actually influence your success
[00:04:54] it's a lot of misguided time and effort
[00:04:57] and it creates a lot of frustration and
[00:04:59] demotivation in fact I would actually
[00:05:00] say that when you focus too narrowly and
[00:05:02] you're not thinking about all these
[00:05:03] other factors that are very rarely
[00:05:05] talked about I would say that
[00:05:07] statistically for most people it becomes
[00:05:09] almost impossible to actually become a
[00:05:11] better learner so prepare to learn a few
[00:05:14] new interesting things in this video
[00:05:17] that will change your perspective on how
[00:05:19] to become a better learner and that's a
[00:05:20] good thing now the second thing you'll
[00:05:22] realize is that a lot of the research
[00:05:25] isn't really geared to actually help you
[00:05:27] be a better learner and that's because
[00:05:30] the purpose of research isn't always to
[00:05:32] help the Learner in fact a lot of it is
[00:05:35] just exploring how learning work some of
[00:05:38] it is just research for research's sake
[00:05:41] um a lot of it is focused on teachers
[00:05:43] like how teachers can teach in a way
[00:05:45] that makes learning more effective and
[00:05:47] so if you look at the entire body of
[00:05:49] like learning science a a very small
[00:05:53] fraction of it is actually about what
[00:05:55] Learners can do to make their learning
[00:05:57] more effective I say it's probably what
[00:05:59] I'd call a new or emerging field and so
[00:06:01] I think for this video one of the most
[00:06:02] valuable things that I can actually do
[00:06:03] for you is to package that research in a
[00:06:05] way that's personally meaningful and
[00:06:07] relevant for you and I think I'm able to
[00:06:11] have a very unique position in doing
[00:06:12] this because you have these researchers
[00:06:14] that are amazing at research and you
[00:06:15] have got these Educators that are
[00:06:16] amazing at educating and you've got
[00:06:18] Learners that can you know have great
[00:06:20] achievement but there's virtually no one
[00:06:22] that actually sits in between them to
[00:06:24] look at the research and to guide
[00:06:25] Educators and to guide Learners in in
[00:06:27] translating all of that and that's what
[00:06:29] I've solely focused on for for years now
[00:06:31] and so what I'm really excited to share
[00:06:33] with you is some of these very
[00:06:35] interesting nuanced observations where
[00:06:38] if you apply this in one way it can just
[00:06:40] be a complete
[00:06:41] GameChanger but if you apply it the
[00:06:43] wrong way then it could become
[00:06:45] completely useless and a waste of time
[00:06:48] so that's what I'm going to try to do in
[00:06:49] this video and without any further Ado
[00:06:51] here is my ultimate guide on remembering
[00:06:54] everything you read and learn based on
[00:06:57] the research now the first major
[00:06:59] question that we can start off with is
[00:07:01] just by asking what is the best way to
[00:07:03] learn something and it's really
[00:07:06] important to recognize that if that's
[00:07:09] the primary question we're trying to
[00:07:10] answer and that's what we're looking at
[00:07:12] the research for you're not really going
[00:07:15] to be able to improve that's
[00:07:17] surprisingly a terrible question to ask
[00:07:20] if you actually want to become better
[00:07:22] and the reason is because learning is a
[00:07:24] massive very complicated process and so
[00:07:28] asking what's the best way to learn is
[00:07:31] kind of like saying what's the best tool
[00:07:34] for building a house it completely
[00:07:38] misunderstands how to use methods for
[00:07:42] different purposes and what it really
[00:07:44] means to become a proficient learner and
[00:07:47] so the real question we need to ask
[00:07:49] ourselves is how does learning and
[00:07:52] memory even work in the first place if
[00:07:55] we can understand what learning actually
[00:07:58] is at a at a cognitive or neurological
[00:08:01] level and we understand what are the
[00:08:04] conditions that if we meet that creates
[00:08:06] the perfect recipe for high quality
[00:08:09] memory and high quality knowledge then
[00:08:11] we can actually reverse engineer that we
[00:08:13] can work backwards and create techniques
[00:08:15] that we know are going to trigger those
[00:08:18] things and so for over the last 100
[00:08:21] years at least there's been a lot of
[00:08:23] research that has come out around how
[00:08:26] learning actually works and how memory
[00:08:28] works and it's a lot to go over all of
[00:08:32] those things so what I'll do is instead
[00:08:34] of just talking about a a single study
[00:08:36] or a single piece of research I'm going
[00:08:38] to synthesize it for you and tell you
[00:08:41] what are some of the most key findings
[00:08:44] that have come up consistently that we
[00:08:46] generally at this current point in time
[00:08:49] understand based on all of that research
[00:08:53] this is some of the core principles of
[00:08:55] how learning works and I want to frame
[00:08:56] it to you in terms of the impact that it
[00:08:59] actually has so let's say that if this
[00:09:02] trophy here
[00:09:04] represents the goal that we're trying to
[00:09:06] achieve right let's let's say that this
[00:09:08] is a first in our class for some kind of
[00:09:11] exam or getting some kind of job
[00:09:12] promotion whatever it is this is why
[00:09:14] we're learning this is the prize that
[00:09:16] we've got our eyes on and in order to do
[00:09:17] that we have to learn new information
[00:09:19] and we don't have to just learn new
[00:09:21] information we have to learn new
[00:09:22] information and have a high level of
[00:09:24] retention retention meaning how long
[00:09:27] we're able to hold things in in our
[00:09:28] memory often we talk about long-term
[00:09:30] memory here but also not just retention
[00:09:32] but our ability to use that information
[00:09:35] in a deep meaningful way there's no
[00:09:38] point having a really high retention on
[00:09:40] 300 different facts what's necessary is
[00:09:42] to actually be able to use that
[00:09:44] information in a way that's contextually
[00:09:46] appropriate so you're not just a fact
[00:09:49] regurgitation machine like just vomiting
[00:09:51] out fact after fact you're able to do
[00:09:54] what's called evaluation you can judge
[00:09:56] the importance of information and you
[00:09:58] can use that to solve problems so this
[00:10:01] is in one word something that is often
[00:10:04] called
[00:10:05] Mastery uh or or
[00:10:08] levels of knowledge and this terminology
[00:10:11] comes from uh research like what Bloom's
[00:10:16] revised taxonomy or solo taxonomies
[00:10:19] which are uh strands of research that
[00:10:22] have tried to categorize different
[00:10:24] levels of knowledge quality and while
[00:10:27] there's a little bit of debate in terms
[00:10:28] of exactly what the different levels are
[00:10:31] the most important thing is to recognize
[00:10:33] that there are different levels of
[00:10:34] knowledge and towards the bottom of this
[00:10:37] level of knowledge which is in a way the
[00:10:40] most useless kind of knowledge is uh
[00:10:43] very
[00:10:44] isolated
[00:10:46] memorization and then above isolated
[00:10:48] memorization which is just regurgitation
[00:10:50] you then have isolated
[00:10:53] understanding now here's a question to
[00:10:55] you how many of you have heard the
[00:10:56] statement memorization is not real
[00:10:59] learning understanding is real
[00:11:03] learning but that is not actually true
[00:11:06] because understanding can still be
[00:11:08] isolated so the key heror is in this
[00:11:10] term isolated this is where the problem
[00:11:13] with this lower level of knowledge or
[00:11:15] the lower level of Mastery lies is that
[00:11:17] anytime information is isolated it
[00:11:19] exists in The Silo and there are very
[00:11:22] few times where we need to use that
[00:11:24] knowledge in a silo so if you imagine
[00:11:27] trying to solve a complicated problem
[00:11:29] the reason it's complicated is because
[00:11:32] it involves multiple Concepts that come
[00:11:34] together in a certain way and then you
[00:11:36] have to apply them in a certain sequence
[00:11:38] you have to get the order correct you
[00:11:40] have to get the relationship and
[00:11:41] interaction between the concepts correct
[00:11:43] you have to understand that accurately
[00:11:44] and so none of that is isolated even
[00:11:47] something as simple as knowing right the
[00:11:50] right question like high quality
[00:11:52] questions to ask this requires you to
[00:11:55] not be thinking in isolation to
[00:11:57] understand the right question to ask you
[00:11:59] have you have to understand where the
[00:12:00] gaps are in your knowledge and those
[00:12:02] gaps are usually going to be in terms of
[00:12:04] how one thing relates to influences uh
[00:12:08] or compares to another thing and so
[00:12:11] anytime we're doing any kind of learning
[00:12:14] that is very isolated very
[00:12:16] compartmentalized very siloed where
[00:12:18] we're just focused on memorizing this
[00:12:20] thing or understanding this thing being
[00:12:23] able to explain just this
[00:12:25] thing we are already working in a low
[00:12:29] lower level of knowledge Mastery and
[00:12:32] this becomes very problematic for some
[00:12:34] other reasons that I'll share later in
[00:12:36] the video so what's the alternative to
[00:12:37] isolated well the alternative to
[00:12:38] isolated is something that I often call
[00:12:40] Integrated and so integrated learning is
[00:12:42] really where we want to be and
[00:12:44] integration essentially means all those
[00:12:46] things that I said before that you're
[00:12:48] not doing an isolation you are
[00:12:50] deliberately comparing and contrasting
[00:12:53] finding similarities and differences
[00:12:55] trying to explore which concept is more
[00:12:57] important than another concept how you
[00:12:59] apply them in different contexts this is
[00:13:02] integrated thinking and what we know is
[00:13:04] that this is the level of Mastery or
[00:13:06] level of knowledge we probably need for
[00:13:08] most reasonably competitive high level
[00:13:12] goals so we've got the retention and the
[00:13:16] Mastery we have to have a deep level of
[00:13:18] understanding that's integrated while
[00:13:20] also being able to hold on to that in
[00:13:21] our memory for long enough that we need
[00:13:24] to use it and it's when we have these
[00:13:26] two things and we're able to achieve the
[00:13:29] these two things in a time that is
[00:13:33] viable for the real world pressures uh
[00:13:36] and constraints that we have that is
[00:13:38] what we would say creates an efficient
[00:13:42] effective learner so instead of now
[00:13:44] asking what's the best method for
[00:13:46] learning we can actually refine and
[00:13:48] focus down that question a lot more we
[00:13:51] can ask the question what creates high
[00:13:53] levels of retention what promotes high
[00:13:57] levels of mastery and deep uh
[00:14:01] understanding of of integrated knowledge
[00:14:03] and what allows us to do that in a fast
[00:14:07] efficient time scale and luckily for us
[00:14:11] a lot of these things can be achieved by
[00:14:15] understanding that memory and your
[00:14:18] retention and your Mastery and your
[00:14:20] level of understanding are actually
[00:14:22] related to each other when you develop a
[00:14:25] high level of Mastery and a deep
[00:14:27] understanding of knowledge it also
[00:14:29] promotes a higher level of retention and
[00:14:33] this is now coming back to strands of
[00:14:35] research that uh we often call cognitive
[00:14:40] architecture or human cognitive
[00:14:43] architecture uh it's also related to a
[00:14:45] strain of research that's called schema
[00:14:49] Theory and again you'll notice that
[00:14:51] right now I'm not pulling up a specific
[00:14:53] study that shows this thing or or
[00:14:55] another thing and actually that is one
[00:14:57] of my kind of pet PE when people often
[00:14:59] talk about research because that's not
[00:15:01] really how research works just because
[00:15:03] one study says something doesn't mean
[00:15:05] that it's true in order to really
[00:15:07] understand a topic you have to be
[00:15:09] reading dozens if not hundreds of
[00:15:12] studies about a certain topic that's
[00:15:14] been conducted across different types of
[00:15:16] people different types of pressures
[00:15:17] different types of challenges to
[00:15:19] understand the full scope of it and I
[00:15:20] actually believe that one of the major
[00:15:23] reasons why there is so much
[00:15:25] misinformation about learning floating
[00:15:27] around is that people don't go through
[00:15:28] that
[00:15:29] process they they find a single article
[00:15:31] that says hey doing this is going to be
[00:15:34] effective and therefore they just kind
[00:15:35] of promote it widespread without
[00:15:37] realizing no what that paper said is
[00:15:40] that for this group of people in this
[00:15:44] set of conditions with this particular
[00:15:46] method for this particular subject when
[00:15:49] tested at this particular time scale it
[00:15:52] was effective but I do understand some
[00:15:54] of you really want to read through the
[00:15:55] primary research so I will actually link
[00:15:57] to what I think are some of the most
[00:16:00] useful high yield articles to get you
[00:16:02] started on this learning research
[00:16:05] Journey if you want I'll leave that in
[00:16:06] the description but I'm going to keep
[00:16:08] the discussion centered around things
[00:16:10] that I think are just more practically
[00:16:11] meaningful for you where I've
[00:16:12] synthesized a lot of This research so
[00:16:14] that you don't have to so coming back to
[00:16:17] cognitive architecture and schema Theory
[00:16:20] just as a recap these are two strands of
[00:16:23] research that explore what creates high
[00:16:27] retention and what creates a high level
[00:16:29] of Mastery and so what the research in
[00:16:32] these strands showed is that when you
[00:16:36] have a high level of Mastery you tend to
[00:16:38] have a higher level of retention as well
[00:16:41] and the reason for that is because the
[00:16:44] brain seems to organize information in
[00:16:47] networks or schemas and the trend is
[00:16:51] that anytime new information comes into
[00:16:54] our brain and is put into a schema a
[00:16:58] network it's connected with other things
[00:17:01] there's a pattern that's forming and
[00:17:02] it's
[00:17:03] integrated then it tends to be something
[00:17:06] that's stickier our brain sees this as
[00:17:08] something that's more relevant it's more
[00:17:10] worth holding on to and therefore it's
[00:17:12] less likely to forget and this is the
[00:17:14] important part the process we use when
[00:17:17] we are
[00:17:18] studying
[00:17:20] significantly affects the quality of the
[00:17:23] schema that we're forming which
[00:17:25] therefore significantly influences our
[00:17:28] attention and our Mastery and so this
[00:17:32] now sort of flies in the face of the
[00:17:34] belief that an effective learner is
[00:17:36] someone who's just born with it they're
[00:17:38] just built different they're just a
[00:17:39] genius they just have a good memory
[00:17:41] while I have a bad memory but I can tell
[00:17:44] you I I don't think I have a good memory
[00:17:50] you know you ask all my friends I'm
[00:17:53] honestly uh embarrassingly forgetful for
[00:17:56] a lot of things uh you know people ask
[00:17:57] me hey remember when you went on that
[00:17:59] trip somewhere you know and then I'll
[00:18:01] think hm did we go there are you sure we
[00:18:03] went there and they'll show me a photo
[00:18:05] of like me at that place I'll be like oh
[00:18:07] yeah that that's a thing that happened
[00:18:09] but when I'm studying and when I'm
[00:18:11] deliberately applying certain processes
[00:18:13] I'm able to confidently learn a massive
[00:18:15] volume of material and have an extremely
[00:18:17] high retention on that and that's
[00:18:19] something that I I have confidence to
[00:18:20] say and so the key concept here is
[00:18:22] understanding that the learning process
[00:18:25] that you use whenever you're learning
[00:18:26] anything when you're reading something
[00:18:28] or you're studying something something
[00:18:29] whether it's for school or for work or
[00:18:30] for anything else in life there is a
[00:18:32] process that's happening there there's a
[00:18:34] physical process of how you're studying
[00:18:36] and and what you're doing and then
[00:18:37] there's a cognitive process of what's
[00:18:39] going on inside your brain and the
[00:18:41] effect of using the right process in our
[00:18:45] brain is high quality learning now I
[00:18:47] don't want to oversimplify it sort of
[00:18:49] natural intelligence or IQ what you're
[00:18:52] born with genetics this does have an
[00:18:54] influence but the important thing is to
[00:18:57] recognize that you can probably increase
[00:19:00] your learning
[00:19:02] ability much more than you think you can
[00:19:05] and even if your genetic potential
[00:19:09] whatever that means is 50% less than
[00:19:12] someone
[00:19:12] else's most people and this is very true
[00:19:16] in my experience working with so many so
[00:19:17] many students most people are only
[00:19:19] really operating at like 10% of what
[00:19:23] their potential really is so whether
[00:19:26] someone's potential is you know 50%
[00:19:28] versus 70% or
[00:19:30] 100% it it it's such a small difference
[00:19:32] compared to actually using more of that
[00:19:36] potential and I think probably most
[00:19:38] people will go their entire lives
[00:19:41] without ever reaching anywhere close to
[00:19:44] where their genetic potential for
[00:19:46] learning actually is so let me give you
[00:19:49] a a key takeaway here to summarize some
[00:19:51] of the things that we've been saying is
[00:19:53] first of all understanding that the
[00:19:56] process of learning significantly
[00:19:59] influences the outcomes of our learning
[00:20:02] and the outcomes of our learning we've
[00:20:04] been talking about as having good memory
[00:20:07] retention and deep levels of knowledge
[00:20:10] AKA Mastery and what that good effective
[00:20:14] process and that good effective outcome
[00:20:16] actually looks like is when we're
[00:20:17] forming these schemas the second thing
[00:20:20] we talked about is the idea of your
[00:20:22] potential but what I want to add to this
[00:20:24] is that when we commit to the process of
[00:20:28] improving the way that we learn using
[00:20:30] better mental cognitive processes for
[00:20:33] learning trying to create those schemas
[00:20:36] it actually trains and rewires our brain
[00:20:39] to be better at those things and so in a
[00:20:41] way our potential for learning can even
[00:20:46] grow and expand and this is something
[00:20:48] that's been demonstrated to us through a
[00:20:50] strand of research uh investigating
[00:20:52] something that's known as
[00:20:55] neuroplasticity which is in summary your
[00:20:58] brain's ability to evolve and grow and
[00:21:03] mold it's called plasticity because it's
[00:21:05] kind of like a PL plastic if you imagine
[00:21:07] molding plastic or melting plastic and
[00:21:10] then reshaping plastic is referring to
[00:21:12] the ability for our brain to rewire
[00:21:15] itself and restructure its connections
[00:21:18] now the research on neuroplasticity is
[00:21:20] actually very complicated but there are
[00:21:22] a few things about how neuroplasticity
[00:21:24] works that become really important if we
[00:21:26] want to actually train ourselves to
[00:21:28] become a better learner one of those
[00:21:30] things is that there is a level of
[00:21:32] intensity and duration of pressure
[00:21:35] that's required to retrain your brain
[00:21:38] and often when I'm coaching I refer to
[00:21:40] this as the pressure for neuroplastic
[00:21:43] change which sounds like a mouthful but
[00:21:46] it's a very simple concept if you
[00:21:48] imagine yourself going to the gym to to
[00:21:51] get stronger and your lifting weights
[00:21:53] that weight is applying a resistance
[00:21:55] it's applying a load to your muscles and
[00:21:57] it's the fact that your muscle is having
[00:21:59] to fight against that resistance that it
[00:22:02] grows and it gets stronger it's a very
[00:22:05] similar thing with changing the way that
[00:22:07] our brain thinks if I teach you a great
[00:22:11] technique that makes you think in a
[00:22:13] certain way and that way of thinking is
[00:22:16] is different and it's it's a good
[00:22:18] process that leads to a high quality
[00:22:19] schema and all of that stuff it tis all
[00:22:21] the boxes but it's different to what
[00:22:23] you're used to then we now have this tug
[00:22:26] of war there is in an existing set of
[00:22:29] habits of learning that you already have
[00:22:31] that you have picked up over the years
[00:22:33] of experience that you have with
[00:22:34] learning and now I'm telling you to do
[00:22:37] things differently and so we're going to
[00:22:40] have a difference between what you're
[00:22:41] comfortable with doing and the habits of
[00:22:44] thinking and processing information
[00:22:46] which may or may not be Optimum and then
[00:22:48] there's this new process that is not yet
[00:22:51] a
[00:22:52] habit so if you try this new method for
[00:22:56] one study session and then 2 hours later
[00:22:58] you look at it and you think you know
[00:22:59] what I don't think that really helped me
[00:23:01] I don't think it improved my retention I
[00:23:03] don't think it improved my Mastery all I
[00:23:05] felt was that it was really really
[00:23:07] difficult the counterintuitive thing
[00:23:09] here is to recognize that that doesn't
[00:23:11] actually mean that that was not
[00:23:13] effective it could just be that you need
[00:23:15] more practice it needs to become
[00:23:17] something that you're more comfortable
[00:23:18] with there's time that's necessary for
[00:23:21] that old Habit to be phased out and for
[00:23:23] you to gain competence and accuracy and
[00:23:26] fluency with this new process and and to
[00:23:29] turn that into a habit and so while I
[00:23:32] will talk about what are some of the
[00:23:35] processes and the things that we can be
[00:23:36] doing and what we should be focusing on
[00:23:38] to improve our process of learning and
[00:23:40] become a better learner what's more
[00:23:42] important to address out right is that
[00:23:46] even if you know everything that you
[00:23:48] need to do every method that's going to
[00:23:51] be the best method of learning for you
[00:23:54] you may actually stop yourself from
[00:23:56] learning and improving on any of these
[00:23:59] things because we
[00:24:01] mistake difficulty for ineffectiveness
[00:24:05] and so this is actually the next major
[00:24:06] concept and strand of research that I
[00:24:08] want to introduce to you which is the
[00:24:11] idea of
[00:24:14] misinterpreted effort
[00:24:17] hypothesis and there are actually many
[00:24:19] strains of research that relate to this
[00:24:21] illusion of fluency illusion of
[00:24:23] competence Q utilization Frameworks
[00:24:26] monitoring judgments all of these are
[00:24:27] terms of if you search for you will find
[00:24:29] related research but it is all talking
[00:24:32] really about this General principle here
[00:24:35] and what this research on the
[00:24:36] misinterpreted effort hypothesis uh has
[00:24:39] shown is that most people even
[00:24:43] incredibly intelligent people mistake
[00:24:46] learning that is difficult or different
[00:24:50] from being ineffective they are
[00:24:53] misinterpreting the effort they're
[00:24:55] saying High effort must mean it's not
[00:24:58] working but actually any learning method
[00:25:02] that is effective that produces a
[00:25:04] highquality schema that improves our
[00:25:07] attention and improves our Mastery and
[00:25:08] makes us a better more efficient learner
[00:25:11] involves mental effort and this is
[00:25:14] actually I think ironically a
[00:25:17] mindblowing concept for a lot of people
[00:25:19] even though when I explain it it's going
[00:25:21] to sound very obvious learning happens
[00:25:24] in the brain which means that if our
[00:25:27] brain is not actively working it means
[00:25:30] it's probably not actively learning it
[00:25:34] is when the brain uses energy and effort
[00:25:39] and turns that energy and effort into
[00:25:41] valuable useful meaningful processes and
[00:25:45] patterns of thinking that take this new
[00:25:47] information that you are reading or
[00:25:49] consuming through any other form and
[00:25:51] then creates these schemas it's building
[00:25:54] that knowledge and that process of
[00:25:56] building knowledge
[00:25:58] takes effort always takes effort and
[00:26:00] always takes energy this is what in the
[00:26:03] research broadly speaking is often
[00:26:05] referred to as active learning it is any
[00:26:08] method of learning that actively
[00:26:10] involves our brain it's an incredibly
[00:26:11] broad term and we can make sort of
[00:26:14] blanket statements that Active Learning
[00:26:17] is always more effective than passive
[00:26:20] learning where our brain is not really
[00:26:22] doing anything and by the way later in
[00:26:24] the video I will provide some practical
[00:26:26] advice and techniques on how you can do
[00:26:28] that Active Learning but I can't
[00:26:31] possibly cover every single technique
[00:26:34] that there is to know others this video
[00:26:36] would be 10 hours long but I still want
[00:26:39] to be able to help you with a little bit
[00:26:41] more of that detailed information and
[00:26:43] give you some additional support so I
[00:26:44] have created a free Weekly Newsletter
[00:26:48] that takes 3 to 5 minutes to read but
[00:26:51] the techniques and the principles in
[00:26:54] that can save you 3 to 10 hours per week
[00:26:57] and these emails are basically basically
[00:26:58] Tred to distill what I think are the
[00:27:00] major lessons and realizations that I
[00:27:02] had in my experience of upgrading the
[00:27:05] way that I learned and just pack those
[00:27:08] into these emails as I said it's
[00:27:09] completely free I'll leave a link in the
[00:27:11] description if you'd like to join and
[00:27:13] we'll get back to our discussion on the
[00:27:15] misinterpreted effort hypothesis and so
[00:27:17] far what I've explained may seem very
[00:27:19] obvious to you but I can tell you for a
[00:27:22] fact this is not as obvious and
[00:27:24] intuitive when we are making our own
[00:27:26] decisions about how to become a better a
[00:27:28] learner because imagine I gave you a
[00:27:30] technique and then you're trying it and
[00:27:31] while you're using this technique you're
[00:27:33] just thinking man this is really hard to
[00:27:34] use this is really difficult then it is
[00:27:37] very natural you can imagine that you'd
[00:27:39] come to that conclusion that I'm not
[00:27:41] going to try this anymore and actually
[00:27:43] what's even worse is when we take that
[00:27:45] to another level where we're saying that
[00:27:48] even our existing habits of learning
[00:27:50] take too much time and too much effort
[00:27:52] and we're going to make it even easier
[00:27:55] we are going to take our brain out of
[00:27:56] the equation even more so it takes less
[00:28:00] effort we have misinterpreted the effort
[00:28:03] so much that we believe that the lower
[00:28:06] the amount of effort the easier learning
[00:28:08] is the more effective it becomes and if
[00:28:11] you don't believe me think about this
[00:28:13] example how many of you have thought
[00:28:15] about know someone or personally do use
[00:28:19] AI use a bunch of apps that will do this
[00:28:23] learning process for you it creates
[00:28:25] summaries for you it will create uh
[00:28:27] notes for you it will you know there's
[00:28:30] even entire there's an entire industry
[00:28:32] of people just selling notes from
[00:28:35] previous year students that did really
[00:28:38] well as if the magic is in the notes
[00:28:40] that they made as opposed to the
[00:28:42] knowledge they built in their head I've
[00:28:44] worked with so many people who have
[00:28:46] these extremely elaborate note taking
[00:28:48] setups and stacks of different apps that
[00:28:51] communicate with each other so that they
[00:28:53] can do as little input and effort as
[00:28:56] possible to get to a of notes that's
[00:28:58] like beautifully collated but the
[00:29:01] question is what's the point there
[00:29:04] wasn't any actual learning that happened
[00:29:07] as part of that
[00:29:08] process and I think what a lot of people
[00:29:10] are surprised about is that for me I
[00:29:12] went from that person I was the one who
[00:29:15] had those very elaborate um sheets and
[00:29:21] note-taking apps and stacks and over the
[00:29:24] years I've begun to use less and less
[00:29:28] and less to the point where now it's
[00:29:30] extremely simple I don't use most apps
[00:29:34] software automations things like that
[00:29:37] what I've realized is that the most
[00:29:40] important thing to Be an Effective
[00:29:41] learner is just to be able to do the
[00:29:43] core thinking process effectively and if
[00:29:46] you're good at that thinking process you
[00:29:48] don't need all this other stuff in fact
[00:29:52] it actually just becomes a
[00:29:54] distraction I often compare it to going
[00:29:57] to the gym to try to get stronger but
[00:30:00] thinking lifting weights is tiring and
[00:30:04] too timec consuming so you just get
[00:30:06] someone to lift it for you and because
[00:30:09] the weight is moving up and down and
[00:30:11] you're seeing the weight move up and
[00:30:13] down you assume that that means you're
[00:30:16] getting the benefit of it and that
[00:30:17] sounds ridiculous but that's the way
[00:30:20] that a lot of us myself included used to
[00:30:23] make this kind of decision about how to
[00:30:25] be a better learner and as long as
[00:30:28] you're misinterpreting that effort and
[00:30:29] you're avoiding that active aspect of
[00:30:32] learning and thinking that effective
[00:30:37] learning means easy learning you will
[00:30:40] probably never be able to truly improve
[00:30:42] and I say that to you not to call you
[00:30:43] out but so that if that is you and you
[00:30:46] resonate with that to recognize that
[00:30:48] this is going to be a major barrier and
[00:30:50] that this is important for you to focus
[00:30:51] on so we've discussed the idea of active
[00:30:55] learning and we've Loosely defined Act
[00:30:58] of learning as your brain using
[00:31:00] processes that take effort in order to
[00:31:03] form these high quality schemas that
[00:31:05] produce better memory and better Mastery
[00:31:07] and that this process of active learning
[00:31:09] is active so now let's finally get to
[00:31:13] that big question so what are the things
[00:31:16] that I should be doing what are the
[00:31:18] methods that I should be using that are
[00:31:20] going to be great Active Learning
[00:31:22] methods that take all of these boxes
[00:31:25] well that's a great question in the
[00:31:27] first place I want to talk talk about is
[00:31:29] the idea of understanding your learning
[00:31:31] style now learning styles is this idea
[00:31:35] that came around in the 7s early 80s is
[00:31:40] where it really gained
[00:31:41] popularity and it was the idea that we
[00:31:44] each have a unique learning style often
[00:31:48] the one that's talked about is varc
[00:31:50] visual auditory read and write
[00:31:52] kinesthetic but there are other sort of
[00:31:54] acronyms that talk about you know
[00:31:56] different ways of categorizing it even
[00:31:58] Bloom uh from Bloom's taxonomy which I
[00:32:00] talk about all the time bloom had his
[00:32:01] own uh Bloom's learning inventories
[00:32:05] which is basically his version of
[00:32:06] learning styles and so learning styles
[00:32:10] is one of the most heavily researched
[00:32:14] things within learning and every month
[00:32:19] there are articles that will come out
[00:32:21] and explore how do we help students
[00:32:24] figure out their ideal learning style
[00:32:26] how do we apply different learning
[00:32:28] styles for teaching how can we uh help
[00:32:33] someone become B at their ideal learning
[00:32:36] style and understanding learning styles
[00:32:40] is an incredibly important piece of
[00:32:43] research because learning styles is not
[00:32:47] a real thing and in fact while I said
[00:32:50] that there's all this research that
[00:32:52] comes out to this day that says we need
[00:32:56] to find ways of of of helping people
[00:33:00] discover their learning
[00:33:01] styles there's another strand of
[00:33:03] research that is exploring why do people
[00:33:07] keep researching about learning styles
[00:33:11] because we have now at least two solid
[00:33:15] Decades of research that has shown that
[00:33:19] people do not have a learning style and
[00:33:24] if you hear me say that and intuitively
[00:33:27] you disagree with that let me explain
[00:33:30] why you probably actually do agree with
[00:33:33] me but there's a special Nuance here
[00:33:37] people certainly do have learning
[00:33:40] preferences and they certainly have
[00:33:42] learning habits but the idea of a
[00:33:45] learning style suggests that there is
[00:33:47] something neuroanatomically or
[00:33:50] genetically that means that a certain
[00:33:53] type or style of learning is favorable
[00:33:56] to one person whereas another sty type
[00:33:59] is favorable to
[00:34:00] another and my favorite analogy for
[00:34:04] talking about why this is not actually
[00:34:05] the case is to talk about
[00:34:08] bananas I remember reading this thing
[00:34:11] and this is not something I've looked at
[00:34:12] the original research on but I remember
[00:34:14] reading this thing that says that a
[00:34:16] banana is 50% genetically identical to a
[00:34:19] human being now look I don't know if
[00:34:20] that's true but I I I think that's
[00:34:21] something that's being thrown around a
[00:34:22] lot human beings are diverse and the the
[00:34:27] human brain is incredibly complicated
[00:34:29] and what works for one person in
[00:34:32] learning certainly doesn't always work
[00:34:34] for another person in learning that's
[00:34:36] incredibly important to to recognize
[00:34:38] that if you just copy someone who's a
[00:34:40] great learner you're not necessarily
[00:34:42] going to get the same results because
[00:34:43] your brain is not the same and you don't
[00:34:45] operate in the same way you don't have
[00:34:47] the same habits that the other person
[00:34:50] has but that's the key is that it's the
[00:34:53] habits and those habits are things that
[00:34:56] were're formed and if we actually you
[00:34:57] think about the human brain the human
[00:34:59] brain of every single human is
[00:35:04] 99.9% exactly the same and that unique
[00:35:08] individual variation and personalization
[00:35:10] while it is important is really an end
[00:35:13] stage of becoming an efficient learner
[00:35:16] that's only when you have certain basic
[00:35:18] good principles down pat and those
[00:35:20] principles of effective learning are
[00:35:23] basically universally the same for every
[00:35:25] single human being I often it to walking
[00:35:29] the human body is very effective at
[00:35:33] walking on our legs and so if you have
[00:35:37] this for whatever reason habit of
[00:35:39] walking on your hands purely in a
[00:35:42] handstand there is probably no level of
[00:35:45] practice or training that you can do
[00:35:48] that gets you to the point where your
[00:35:49] hand walking is going to be better than
[00:35:51] your foot walking unless you have some
[00:35:53] kind of disability and the same thing
[00:35:54] for learning there are certain ways of
[00:35:57] thinking that the human brain is just
[00:36:00] good at it's adapted to be able to do
[00:36:02] this kind of thinking very effectively
[00:36:05] while it struggles to do another type of
[00:36:07] thinking and so when we look at this
[00:36:09] research we know that most people are
[00:36:14] visual Learners and they gain a lot of
[00:36:16] learning from visual media and this is
[00:36:18] because we know that the human brain
[00:36:20] processes visual information tens of
[00:36:23] thousands of times faster than written
[00:36:26] information we also know that reading
[00:36:30] and writing tends to be the second most
[00:36:32] common learning preference SL learning
[00:36:35] habit and a lot of that is because our
[00:36:37] education system is designed around
[00:36:39] reading and writing and so while there
[00:36:41] are individual variances and different
[00:36:43] habits here's what we can say as a
[00:36:45] blanket statement what the research
[00:36:47] tells us is that most
[00:36:50] people will be able to learn through any
[00:36:55] style or modality
[00:36:57] if they're taught how to and they have
[00:36:59] time to practice and build that into a
[00:37:02] habit and basically everyone will
[00:37:05] benefit from learning in more than just
[00:37:08] one style or
[00:37:10] modality and there is a benefit to
[00:37:13] learning to be able to do that because
[00:37:16] again from a practical
[00:37:17] perspective being restricted to needing
[00:37:20] to learn through one style or modality
[00:37:24] is incredibly restrictive and in the
[00:37:26] research a lot of the the scholars
[00:37:28] comment on the the negative part of
[00:37:31] learning styles being that it's not just
[00:37:34] saying that it doesn't work it actually
[00:37:36] creates a fixed mindset and pigeon ho
[00:37:38] holding of what you are and are not
[00:37:41] capable of as a learner and this is the
[00:37:44] reason I said understanding learning
[00:37:47] styles was incredibly important because
[00:37:49] you have to realize that your brain is
[00:37:53] is capable of a
[00:37:55] lot yes even even even even your brain
[00:37:58] you know I I know you're probably
[00:37:59] sitting there you're shaking your head
[00:38:01] and you're thinking are you sure about
[00:38:02] that you don't know my brain but trust
[00:38:03] me your brain is capable of learning and
[00:38:06] adapting to a lot of things it is very
[00:38:09] very good at learning and if you want to
[00:38:12] become a better learner and you want to
[00:38:13] make learning easier for yourself it is
[00:38:16] always in your best interest to learn
[00:38:18] how to learn through multiple modalities
[00:38:20] and styles it makes you more flexible it
[00:38:22] makes you more adaptable it makes you a
[00:38:24] more powerful learner and it is simply
[00:38:27] just about training processes and
[00:38:29] building new habits so the main point
[00:38:31] that I want to make with this learning
[00:38:33] styles thing is not that you should
[00:38:34] worry about the learning styles it is
[00:38:37] that there are not learning styles and
[00:38:40] we need to shift our perspective from
[00:38:43] what is the method of learning that is
[00:38:46] right for me and what is the box I need
[00:38:51] to trap myself within and instead think
[00:38:54] what are my current habits what are my
[00:38:57] current
[00:38:58] preferences when does it work for me
[00:39:01] when does it not work for me and how can
[00:39:05] I change and optimize those methods and
[00:39:08] those habits so that it works for me
[00:39:11] better and more often that's the
[00:39:13] perspective that you need to have to
[00:39:15] become a better learner and so I'll
[00:39:16] summarize that by saying that learning
[00:39:19] is not something that is fixed but
[00:39:21] rather we should be thinking about it
[00:39:22] with a growth mindset of what can I do
[00:39:26] how can I grow to meet my learning needs
[00:39:30] now I want to make something clear I've
[00:39:33] just talked about why learning styles
[00:39:35] don't exist but some of you will know
[00:39:38] that I do talk about learner types which
[00:39:42] do exist your learner type unlike your
[00:39:46] learning style is a reflection of your
[00:39:49] current processes and habits that you
[00:39:52] use for Learning and what I've noticed
[00:39:53] is that people tend to have fairly
[00:39:56] predictable sets of habits and processes
[00:39:59] and different combinations and that
[00:40:01] creates your learner type so why is a
[00:40:03] learner type important because when you
[00:40:04] understand your learner type it allows
[00:40:06] you to see where your biggest learning
[00:40:08] strengths and weaknesses really are
[00:40:11] sometimes I feel like and this is really
[00:40:14] the case in my early years of
[00:40:16] experimenting I spent so much time trial
[00:40:19] and error on trying to figure out how to
[00:40:21] learn better without actually realizing
[00:40:23] what was holding me back in the first
[00:40:25] place and what I should lean into more
[00:40:27] it was very confusing and so one of the
[00:40:29] major goals for me when I started
[00:40:31] coaching was I needed to help other
[00:40:33] people figure that out for themselves
[00:40:36] how can they avoid that unnecessary
[00:40:39] trial and error that I went through and
[00:40:42] now how I've created it is through a
[00:40:45] quiz so there is a free quiz that I
[00:40:47] created that will ask you a series of
[00:40:49] questions on the most common processes
[00:40:52] and habits and it's not everything but
[00:40:54] they are the ones that I think are the
[00:40:55] most defining of type and it will then
[00:40:59] actually score you and rate you and then
[00:41:01] tell you what your learner type is with
[00:41:03] a report that says hey this is probably
[00:41:06] your learning strength lean into that
[00:41:08] more and then these are the things that
[00:41:10] are holding you back you really want to
[00:41:12] place a lot of priority on that and a
[00:41:14] lot of the times it may not be what
[00:41:16] you're expecting which is a good thing
[00:41:18] to save you time on Improvement given
[00:41:20] that you've watched this far into the
[00:41:22] video it probably means that you're
[00:41:24] pretty serious about learning so for you
[00:41:27] as a gift uh I'll leave a link to that
[00:41:29] quiz in the description as well now the
[00:41:31] unfortunate news is that I basically
[00:41:33] took this entire piece of research
[00:41:36] around learning styles and I just said
[00:41:38] that's not where you should spend your
[00:41:39] attention on so then where should you
[00:41:41] spend your attention on what is the
[00:41:43] method of learning that you should be
[00:41:44] focusing on that's going to help you to
[00:41:46] become a better learner and have better
[00:41:48] memory and better Mastery and achieve
[00:41:49] all these great things that I've been
[00:41:51] telling you you can achieve this entire
[00:41:52] time well no discussion about learning
[00:41:56] science or or research or methods of
[00:41:58] learning would be complete without
[00:42:00] talking about one of the most
[00:42:03] well-studied and legitimately incredibly
[00:42:06] valuable methods and techniques that you
[00:42:09] should apply within your learning system
[00:42:11] which is spacing and if you already know
[00:42:15] what spacing is or you've heard of the
[00:42:18] term space repetition or space
[00:42:20] retrieval then make sure to pay
[00:42:23] attention to this one because there's a
[00:42:26] way of thinking about this that most
[00:42:28] people that are familiar with this
[00:42:29] concept completely Miss for those of you
[00:42:32] that aren't familiar here's the quick
[00:42:33] recap back in the late 19th century uh
[00:42:39] 1885 this researcher very early
[00:42:43] influential researcher called irman
[00:42:45] ebbing House created this study um and
[00:42:50] from the study produced something that
[00:42:52] was known as the ebbing house forgetting
[00:42:55] curve and this is probably one of the
[00:42:57] most important principles to understand
[00:42:59] to really have a good foundation of how
[00:43:01] learning in memory Works The eing
[00:43:04] house's forgetting curve looks something
[00:43:06] like this we have time on the x- axis
[00:43:10] and we have our memory or you could call
[00:43:13] it retention on the y- AIS and the
[00:43:18] experiment went something like this he
[00:43:20] would teach his participants a
[00:43:23] particular new piece of information and
[00:43:26] then he would get get them to try to
[00:43:27] recall that information after a period
[00:43:30] of time and what he found was that after
[00:43:33] a period of time let's say one day that
[00:43:37] retention would drop precipitously I
[00:43:41] mean we you know we' go from uh you know
[00:43:44] let's say a 90% retention after a few
[00:43:47] seconds down to 10% retention after one
[00:43:52] day and importantly and this is where
[00:43:54] the spacing part comes in he found that
[00:43:57] when you take that same piece of
[00:43:58] information and you teach this person
[00:44:01] again after a period of time let's say a
[00:44:04] day later and then you test them on it
[00:44:07] again
[00:44:09] that um memory Fades a little bit more
[00:44:13] slowly and when you do it again and you
[00:44:16] space it again that memory Fades even
[00:44:19] slower still and so this process of
[00:44:21] memory fading and that retention
[00:44:24] dropping with time which we are all
[00:44:25] viscerally familiar with
[00:44:27] uh this is something that's called
[00:44:29] knowledge Decay it's a common term
[00:44:32] you'll see thrown around in the research
[00:44:34] and knowledge Decay obviously is not a
[00:44:36] good thing if we basically didn't have
[00:44:39] knowledge Decay we would just be able to
[00:44:41] learn something and just remember it
[00:44:42] completely for forever but everything
[00:44:45] has a knowledge Decay All Information
[00:44:48] experiences knowledge Decay it doesn't
[00:44:50] matter how well you learn it it doesn't
[00:44:51] matter what it means to you you give it
[00:44:53] enough time and everything will
[00:44:56] experience the knowledge Decay now some
[00:44:57] of sometimes that decay occurs over
[00:45:00] years and years and years and years and
[00:45:02] years and years and sometimes there are
[00:45:04] certain things that stick into our
[00:45:06] memory so strongly that it creates such
[00:45:09] a core memory that that knowledge Decay
[00:45:13] happens so slowly that we're not
[00:45:16] actually going to forget it for the rest
[00:45:17] of our lives uh but
[00:45:20] technically based on how the brain works
[00:45:22] if we were to live forever we would
[00:45:25] eventually come to a point where one day
[00:45:26] we get it to and so the reason eping
[00:45:29] house is fting curve is so influential
[00:45:31] and everyone talks about this is because
[00:45:35] what it shows is that spacing is an
[00:45:38] effective way of making knowledge Decay
[00:45:41] slower and based on this we have very
[00:45:44] popular techniques now for example
[00:45:46] flashcards using uh popular flash card
[00:45:50] apps the big ones obviously if you know
[00:45:51] about it is anky but using flash card
[00:45:54] apps that use a combination of act
[00:45:58] recall and spaced
[00:46:03] retrieval and I'll talk about what
[00:46:05] active recall means uh in a little bit
[00:46:07] and so therefore if you take new
[00:46:08] information and you load it up into
[00:46:10] something like flash cards and you set
[00:46:12] it on a timer and modern apps like Anki
[00:46:15] have extremely Advanced spacing
[00:46:18] algorithms that are substantially more
[00:46:20] sophisticated than back in the late
[00:46:23] 1800s when eing house was doing his
[00:46:25] experiments um and it will it will tell
[00:46:27] you when you're likely to forget a piece
[00:46:30] of information and therefore when you
[00:46:31] need to just hit it again with another
[00:46:33] pulse to keep that knowledge Decay uh
[00:46:37] from getting too Steep and these are
[00:46:39] very very effective tools and I used
[00:46:43] flash cards extremely extensively
[00:46:47] through medical school um thousands and
[00:46:50] thousands of flash cards a great
[00:46:53] proportion of my life on Earth spent
[00:46:56] making doing flash cards and if you're
[00:46:58] particularly interested on why this
[00:47:00] works then you may be interested in
[00:47:02] learning about the spacing effect uh
[00:47:04] which is the branch of research within
[00:47:07] cognitive load Theory which tries to
[00:47:10] explain why spacing works but again uh I
[00:47:13] I don't think that it's particularly
[00:47:15] important for you to understand why
[00:47:16] spacing works as much as understanding
[00:47:20] when spacing doesn't work so well and
[00:47:24] what the alternatives are so so if you
[00:47:28] go down this path which many people do
[00:47:30] and I went down super deep down this
[00:47:33] path then you will end up with a vast
[00:47:38] amount of knowledge on flash cards that
[00:47:41] you just need to repeat and here is an
[00:47:44] area where only research recently is
[00:47:48] coming out to express what the
[00:47:50] limitations are is that it's very easy
[00:47:53] to enter into a flash card overwhelm if
[00:47:57] you think about it like this what we're
[00:47:59] saying is that for each new piece of
[00:48:00] information that we learn let's say that
[00:48:02] that's this Square new info when we
[00:48:06] place it into a flash card we are saying
[00:48:08] that we're utilizing the spacing effect
[00:48:10] to help consolidate that information and
[00:48:12] keep it into our memory we're using that
[00:48:14] as the vehicle to achieve high levels of
[00:48:18] retention so that means that to achieve
[00:48:22] the benefit of the spacing effect we
[00:48:24] have to do the repetitions you can't
[00:48:26] just make a flash card and then
[00:48:27] automatically have that retention higher
[00:48:29] you have to then do the flash card you
[00:48:31] have to do the space retrieval and
[00:48:33] recall it again to get the benefit of it
[00:48:36] and so there's time spent in creating
[00:48:39] this first flash card but then obviously
[00:48:42] we have to then spend time to do that
[00:48:44] flash card again when it's due and
[00:48:46] usually for most pieces of information
[00:48:48] we have to repeat this process around 3
[00:48:51] to seven times for us to reach a level
[00:48:55] of retention that that's suitable for
[00:48:58] for our goals you know let's say we're
[00:48:59] trying to reach a 90% plus retention on
[00:49:02] this it takes somewhere between three to
[00:49:03] seven
[00:49:05] repetitions for that knowledge Decay to
[00:49:07] be slow enough that we're not
[00:49:12] realistically going to forget it anytime
[00:49:13] soon and what this means is and here's
[00:49:16] the danger that for each new one piece
[00:49:21] of information we're trying to learn we
[00:49:23] are committing to 3 to seven times of
[00:49:27] repetition in the future and this is
[00:49:30] something that I call creating learning
[00:49:34] debt learning debt is something that
[00:49:37] I've observed which is when you do
[00:49:41] something for that prepares you for your
[00:49:44] learning but it's your future self that
[00:49:48] has to do something with it to actually
[00:49:50] get the benefit of the learning the
[00:49:52] great example other than flash cards and
[00:49:54] just making a ton of flash cards which
[00:49:56] your future yourself somehow needs to
[00:49:57] find the time to finish all of them is
[00:50:00] just writing a lot of copious notes the
[00:50:04] process of actually writing notes is not
[00:50:07] something that automatically creates
[00:50:09] high efficiency learning there is a
[00:50:12] right way of writing notes that can be
[00:50:14] very effective and there is a way of
[00:50:17] writing notes that is actually
[00:50:19] detrimental it's like it would have been
[00:50:21] better to not have written the notes in
[00:50:23] the first place at all and uh there is a
[00:50:26] Great Piece of research uh a review of
[00:50:29] research done by Jansen who is a
[00:50:32] prominent uh scientist in the cognitive
[00:50:35] science space which looks at what seem
[00:50:39] to be the trends of effective versus not
[00:50:42] effective note taking when we think
[00:50:44] about it in terms of what process the
[00:50:45] brain actually uses and without going
[00:50:47] into too much depth in it and it is um
[00:50:49] quite detailed if you're interested I'll
[00:50:50] make sure to link that in the
[00:50:51] description as well um it comes back to
[00:50:53] what I was talking about before and that
[00:50:55] methods of notetaking that are active
[00:50:57] that use our brain to actively connect
[00:51:00] information together form a big picture
[00:51:02] relate ideas and form a schema in a way
[00:51:04] that's integrated tend to produce better
[00:51:06] impacts on our retention and better
[00:51:09] impacts on our level of knowledge and
[00:51:11] Mastery when we don't write notes in a
[00:51:13] way that does all of that when we
[00:51:15] writing notes very passively and you're
[00:51:17] just kind of like just typing things out
[00:51:19] as the lecturer is talking to you or
[00:51:21] something like that this creates
[00:51:23] learning debt because in order to
[00:51:24] extract the benefit of the time you
[00:51:25] spent on writing those notes you have to
[00:51:27] spend time later to review and
[00:51:29] consolidate those notes and when it
[00:51:30] comes to flash cards boy does learning
[00:51:34] debt build up quickly if you're anything
[00:51:37] like me for a single lecture a 1- hour
[00:51:41] lecture I may end up with between 30 to
[00:51:44] 50 new flash cards which means that
[00:51:48] sometime in the future I need to do
[00:51:51] something like 150 flashcards and that
[00:51:54] is per lecture and I would have three
[00:51:57] sometimes four lectures a day which
[00:51:59] means that every single day I'm making
[00:52:00] something like 150 to up to 200 new
[00:52:04] flash cards that the future me needs to
[00:52:07] cover three to seven times each which
[00:52:10] means at some point next week I'm going
[00:52:12] to need to fit in the time for like 500
[00:52:15] to 1,000
[00:52:17] repetitions of flash cards and next week
[00:52:21] guess what happens there's a whole new
[00:52:23] set of flash cards that I'm creating and
[00:52:26] the the unfortunate thing is this
[00:52:28] strategy would work perfectly
[00:52:32] fine if we were able to get to a
[00:52:35] knowledge Decay that is slow and gradual
[00:52:41] within that week if within that week I
[00:52:43] can make these flash cards and do the
[00:52:45] repetitions and by repeating it a few
[00:52:47] times in that week alone I'm able to
[00:52:51] just basically lock down that knowledge
[00:52:53] and I don't really have to worry about
[00:52:55] repeating them again the week after or
[00:52:57] the week after that this would actually
[00:52:59] be a strategy that works fine for
[00:53:02] retention but unfortunately it doesn't
[00:53:05] work that way and actually what we find
[00:53:07] and the research is actually incredibly
[00:53:09] varied in terms of how long it takes it
[00:53:13] it depends on what you're learning your
[00:53:14] prior level of knowledge the type of
[00:53:16] flash card that you're making how how
[00:53:18] frequently you're doing it how
[00:53:20] complicated the the the concept itself
[00:53:22] is it depends on many many many factors
[00:53:24] but generally speaking it takes weeks of
[00:53:27] this constant spacing to get to that
[00:53:29] level that we want to get to which means
[00:53:31] that you're actually accumulating and
[00:53:33] stockpiling this debt almost endlessly
[00:53:37] and so a very common phenomenon that I
[00:53:39] observe in University students
[00:53:41] especially very proactive University
[00:53:43] students who are really motivated to
[00:53:46] learn effectively they will
[00:53:49] spend hours making flash cards within
[00:53:52] their first week and by the second week
[00:53:54] of the semester they're already starting
[00:53:55] to get over won't they're already on the
[00:53:58] back foot and so there's actually a key
[00:54:00] limitation with any method of learning
[00:54:05] that relies heavily on just the spacing
[00:54:08] effect alone and that limitation is that
[00:54:11] it can become unsustainable it just the
[00:54:15] the numbers do not work out it doesn't
[00:54:18] scale but there is actually another
[00:54:20] limitation with uh this particular
[00:54:22] strategy that I've mentioned in terms of
[00:54:25] using flash cards and is that it doesn't
[00:54:27] address the Mastery aspect of it and
[00:54:29] this is a double-edged sort because now
[00:54:32] we are using all of our time on Just for
[00:54:35] example covering flash cards heavily
[00:54:37] relying on the spacing effect which is
[00:54:39] already unsustainable which means that
[00:54:41] the time we're spending on this just get
[00:54:42] gross with time but also even though
[00:54:46] we're spending all of that time we're
[00:54:49] going to struggle to reach those higher
[00:54:51] levels of Mastery why because if we
[00:54:53] think about the process mentally that is
[00:54:56] an involved and just answering these
[00:54:58] flash cards it is usually still very
[00:55:01] isolated we're testing on our ability to
[00:55:03] recall discret answers to single
[00:55:05] questions or regurgitating specific
[00:55:07] facts and because we're still working in
[00:55:09] that isolated way we're not training our
[00:55:11] knowledge and building our knowledge to
[00:55:13] be able to use it in that integrated way
[00:55:15] so anytime we come across a complex
[00:55:17] problem or have to apply it in a certain
[00:55:18] way this method is not well suited to
[00:55:22] achieve that goal and so the limitation
[00:55:24] here number two is that that there is a
[00:55:28] Mastery
[00:55:32] limit now you might say well Justin
[00:55:36] can't you just make flash cards that ask
[00:55:39] on multiple different concepts like
[00:55:41] instead of saying hey explain this
[00:55:43] process or Define this term you say how
[00:55:46] does this concept compare with this
[00:55:48] concept now technically you could but
[00:55:53] there are so many combinations and per
[00:55:56] ation of relationships between these
[00:55:58] different concepts that that just adds
[00:56:00] to the unsustainable problem all over
[00:56:02] again and trust me again I made the
[00:56:05] mistakes for you I experimented a lot
[00:56:07] with trying to get to a point with
[00:56:10] having these
[00:56:11] multi-relational integrated flash cards
[00:56:14] and it's it's it's either too timec
[00:56:17] consuming to even just make them in the
[00:56:18] first place or like there's so many
[00:56:22] questions that I come up with that I'm
[00:56:23] never doing them I'm I'm already
[00:56:24] struggling getting through just my
[00:56:26] simple regurge questions as is now
[00:56:28] here's the kicker this technique of just
[00:56:31] loading up flash cards or just writing
[00:56:33] notes and then just just regurgitating
[00:56:35] notes and then going and rereading notes
[00:56:37] later these are very very very common
[00:56:40] study techniques you probably already
[00:56:41] know this and so this begs the question
[00:56:44] why is it so common well for one a lot
[00:56:48] of people will encounter this as the
[00:56:50] first technique that they're using and
[00:56:51] they're going from a state of complete
[00:56:53] passive learning to Now using something
[00:56:56] like flash cards which tests you and
[00:56:59] invokes this thing that I said before uh
[00:57:01] which is the active recall which I'll
[00:57:03] talk a little bit more about later and
[00:57:05] so the active part of this active recall
[00:57:08] is the fact that it's having to use our
[00:57:09] brain with we're recalling on that
[00:57:11] knowledge and we're drawing from our
[00:57:14] memory to try to answer this question
[00:57:15] and so that's a more involved process
[00:57:17] and as it's a more involved process our
[00:57:19] brain is doing more to build that
[00:57:20] knowledge so therefore it's often one of
[00:57:23] the first kind of effective learning
[00:57:26] strategies that someone will use and
[00:57:29] they won't really appreciate the
[00:57:32] limitations of this until a little bit
[00:57:34] later but the other thing is because
[00:57:38] this is a technique which sits on a very
[00:57:41] small list of techniques that are very
[00:57:46] easy to use and therefore it's much less
[00:57:50] likely to trigger what we talked about
[00:57:52] before which is this misinterpreted
[00:57:54] effort hypothesis because the proced
[00:57:56] effort is not very high it doesn't take
[00:57:59] a lot of effort to build out a bunch of
[00:58:02] flash cards it doesn't take much effort
[00:58:04] to scroll through your app and answer
[00:58:06] them it's just asking you the question
[00:58:08] all you got to do is answer them and so
[00:58:10] this technique is actually fairly
[00:58:14] effective and it's very easy to use and
[00:58:17] so what I'm saying is not don't use it
[00:58:20] this is the devil stop doing it what I'm
[00:58:22] saying is understand the limitations of
[00:58:25] this technique so that you don't run
[00:58:27] into the Trap of being overwhelmed by it
[00:58:31] I'm a huge fan of using flash cards and
[00:58:34] any type of active recall space
[00:58:37] retrieval technique but only when it's
[00:58:39] aligned with our goals and what we're
[00:58:41] trying to achieve and if we're finding
[00:58:42] issues with the limitations it's it's
[00:58:45] unsustainable we're feeling overwhelmed
[00:58:47] or we're spending all of this time doing
[00:58:49] the cards but we're still not able to
[00:58:51] reach that level of Mastery that we want
[00:58:53] then that indicates that there's a
[00:58:54] problem there's a gap in the Learning
[00:58:55] System that we need to fill through
[00:58:57] another method and that method may be a
[00:59:02] little bit more effortful than doing
[00:59:05] flash cards and we have to accept that
[00:59:07] so what else can we do on top of this to
[00:59:10] supplement our flash cards to solve some
[00:59:11] of this problem achieve that high level
[00:59:13] of retention and achieve a higher level
[00:59:16] of Mastery you know what's the what's
[00:59:18] the golden technique here here's a hot
[00:59:21] tip from my years of coaching is that
[00:59:24] any technique that is based around
[00:59:27] retrieval which is the act of calling
[00:59:30] information from your memory and then
[00:59:32] using that this is as opposed to often
[00:59:35] what we call encoding which is new
[00:59:39] information coming in and then putting
[00:59:41] that into our memory for the first time
[00:59:43] retrieval is when we are taking that
[00:59:45] memory out you know encoding is like
[00:59:47] putting it in the Box retrieval is like
[00:59:49] taking it out of the box and I'm really
[00:59:51] oversimplifying it but retrieval when I
[00:59:54] say retrieval I'm talking about taking
[00:59:56] Knowledge from outside of your
[00:59:58] memory any method that's based around
[01:00:03] retrieval tends to be easier and more
[01:00:06] bang for buck if you're a beginner
[01:00:09] learner than any method that increases
[01:00:13] that quality of knowledge and the
[01:00:14] encoding in the first place the
[01:00:17] difficulty to gain really good high
[01:00:20] quality encoding skills which means that
[01:00:24] that knowledge comes into your brain
[01:00:26] and the knowledge Decay curve instead of
[01:00:28] you falling off having 90% drop in
[01:00:33] knowledge after you know by the end of
[01:00:35] the week if we can change that so that
[01:00:38] by the end of the week you have 90% of
[01:00:40] the knowledge remaining your retention
[01:00:42] is 90% that actually fundamentally
[01:00:45] solves a lot of different problems I
[01:00:48] mean just imagine if you remembered 90%
[01:00:51] of everything that you learned after
[01:00:53] learning it just one
[01:00:54] time that that is what it means to
[01:00:57] develop our ability to encode and that's
[01:01:00] an incredibly powerful and worthwhile
[01:01:02] thing for most people to pursue but it
[01:01:04] takes
[01:01:06] time it is a much more complicated
[01:01:08] process and in my experience with you
[01:01:11] know this is what we do with at with
[01:01:13] with my program at I can study we are
[01:01:15] teaching people these retrieval and
[01:01:18] encoding skills and we always always
[01:01:21] always start off by teaching the
[01:01:23] retrieval skills because retrieval
[01:01:24] skills you can learn them very quickly
[01:01:28] you can do it correctly very quickly
[01:01:31] like the learning curve is very very low
[01:01:34] and it's a effective technique that
[01:01:39] produces noticeable short-term changes
[01:01:42] to your uh retention and your knowledge
[01:01:46] Mastery and it's something that provides
[01:01:48] that kind of like immediate Improvement
[01:01:51] and so if you're just starting out and
[01:01:53] thinking well where do I start with
[01:01:55] improving the way that I'm learning I
[01:01:57] would say start with your retrieval
[01:01:58] techniques think about your retrieval
[01:02:00] techniques and I'm going to give you a
[01:02:01] few that you know hit hit the um right
[01:02:05] cognitive principles so that you can
[01:02:07] start with those ones and once you're
[01:02:10] pretty comfortable with reasonable
[01:02:13] retrieval techniques then you can start
[01:02:15] working on improving your encoding
[01:02:18] strategies and as you improve your
[01:02:20] encoding strategies then life kind of
[01:02:23] just gets easier overall because it's
[01:02:25] just less stuff that you're forgetting
[01:02:27] that's when you're really going to start
[01:02:28] feeling like that pressure is lifting
[01:02:30] off uh and that you're you're you know
[01:02:33] reaching a level of performance and
[01:02:35] learning efficiency that just feels
[01:02:37] completely unreal but that Improvement
[01:02:41] takes weeks slash months whereas getting
[01:02:45] the benefit from retrieval is something
[01:02:47] that can take hours days a couple weeks
[01:02:52] so let's talk a little bit about what
[01:02:54] are some of the retrieval strategies
[01:02:57] that are
[01:02:58] active that help us to form a good
[01:03:02] schema and therefore will help us with
[01:03:05] producing High retention and high
[01:03:07] Mastery now there are really many
[01:03:09] techniques that can
[01:03:12] work and it's more useful to think about
[01:03:14] it as the criteria that if this
[01:03:17] technique hits it it's probably going to
[01:03:20] be effective and I'll give you some
[01:03:21] examples of techniques that just hit it
[01:03:23] off the bat as well the first thing is
[01:03:25] that we want it to be helping us create
[01:03:28] a schema so what does that mean again
[01:03:30] creating a schema means that it's
[01:03:32] testing our knowledge in a way that is
[01:03:34] relatively integrated number two we
[01:03:38] wanted to use active
[01:03:41] recall so as promised what is active
[01:03:44] recall active recall is really anytime
[01:03:48] you are retrieving Knowledge from your
[01:03:51] memory and often the word that I've
[01:03:55] already described retrieval and active
[01:03:58] recall mean the same thing now in the
[01:04:01] research strictly there are some Nuance
[01:04:04] differences depending on how it's being
[01:04:06] used in context but anytime you're
[01:04:08] taking information from your memory can
[01:04:10] be considered active recall but what's
[01:04:12] important is to define the different
[01:04:15] types of active recoil because not all
[01:04:18] forms of active recall are actually
[01:04:21] effective there are three commonly
[01:04:23] talked about forms of active recall and
[01:04:27] some people argue that these are not all
[01:04:30] active but it really depends on what
[01:04:32] their definition of active recall is and
[01:04:33] I haven't seen anyone come to a
[01:04:34] consensus on it but the three different
[01:04:37] methods uh that are often talked about
[01:04:39] are free
[01:04:40] recall cued recall and then
[01:04:45] recognition free recall is when you're
[01:04:47] retrieving knowledge without any kind of
[01:04:50] prompt for example if you just memorize
[01:04:54] the list of 10 words and then you try to
[01:04:57] recall that list of 10 words that's free
[01:05:00] recall cued recall is when there's a
[01:05:03] prompt so for example you memorize a
[01:05:05] list of 10 words and then there's a
[01:05:06] question what is the list of 10 words or
[01:05:09] what is the fourth word on that list
[01:05:12] it's a
[01:05:13] q recognition or recognition based
[01:05:16] recall is when you're simply recognizing
[01:05:19] it so let's say that there's a list of
[01:05:21] 10 things we then show you a list of the
[01:05:24] 10 things and then you make a decision
[01:05:26] ah yeah yes I leared that I recognize
[01:05:29] that for most learning uh for most
[01:05:32] instances except for a few rare
[01:05:33] exceptions recognition-based recall is
[01:05:36] not very useful but it's also
[01:05:38] dangerously common and a very very
[01:05:41] common example of people using
[01:05:43] recognition based recall and I
[01:05:44] distinctly remember doing this not
[01:05:46] realizing how detrimental it was for my
[01:05:48] study hours of time that I wasted if I
[01:05:51] if I'd only known this when I was in
[01:05:53] high school I remember doing loads and
[01:05:55] loads of practice exams and I couldn't
[01:05:59] be bothered writing out the answers to
[01:06:01] the exams and so what I would do is
[01:06:03] initially I would just answer it in my
[01:06:05] head and then check the
[01:06:06] answers and eventually because I just
[01:06:09] wanted to get through more practice
[01:06:10] questions I went through reading the
[01:06:12] question maybe thinking about it for
[01:06:13] like 3 4 seconds to just generally feel
[01:06:17] whether I'd be able to answer it and
[01:06:18] then I check the answer and then see if
[01:06:20] it made sense to me and if it made sense
[01:06:22] to me I'd be like oh yeah yep I know
[01:06:24] that and that is dangerous SL useless
[01:06:30] because our ability to recognize
[01:06:32] something is
[01:06:34] extremely high compared to our ability
[01:06:37] to recall and generate that Knowledge
[01:06:40] from memory it's kind of like if you
[01:06:43] were to take a a a coin like a like a
[01:06:46] money a monetary coin of whatever
[01:06:48] country you're living in you've probably
[01:06:50] seen that coin you know hundreds of
[01:06:53] times and if I showed you that coin
[01:06:54] you'd look at it and you'd say yeah I
[01:06:56] that that's a coin like that's that's my
[01:06:57] country's coin if I showed you a
[01:06:58] different country's coin you'd look at
[01:06:59] it and be like hm yeah that's not my
[01:07:02] country's coin you know there's some
[01:07:03] subtle differences that I'm recognizing
[01:07:06] but for most people if I said to draw
[01:07:10] that coin from memory I doubt there are
[01:07:13] many people who would be able to
[01:07:15] accurately draw it and this is the thing
[01:07:16] is that when you are testing yourself
[01:07:20] and you're using recognition based on
[01:07:22] the answer or an answer sheet and your
[01:07:24] assessment of whether you know that or
[01:07:28] not is whether you understand the answer
[01:07:31] and it makes sense to you then you're
[01:07:33] falling into this recognition trap just
[01:07:36] because you recognize and the answer
[01:07:38] makes sense to you does not in any way
[01:07:42] mean you would be able to generate that
[01:07:45] answer without having had the answer
[01:07:48] provided to you so recognition is a huge
[01:07:51] trap but what about free recall or cued
[01:07:54] recall free recall and cued recall cued
[01:07:59] recall to a lesser extent are both much
[01:08:01] more effective methods the reason that
[01:08:05] cued recall can be dangerous sometimes
[01:08:08] is when we expose ourselves to the Q too
[01:08:11] much and too frequently and so we get
[01:08:13] this I often talk about it as like a q
[01:08:15] saturation and that we're now not
[01:08:18] actually retrieving the knowledge in a
[01:08:20] contextually appropriate way we're just
[01:08:22] testing our ability to recognize the Q
[01:08:25] and this what happened to me uh when I
[01:08:27] was doing heavy heavy flash cards and
[01:08:29] there are these flash cards that I would
[01:08:31] have repeated like 10 times across the
[01:08:35] course of you know let's say a couple of
[01:08:36] months and I can read the first three or
[01:08:40] four words of that flash card question
[01:08:43] and I can tell you what the answer is
[01:08:45] and so you got to ask yourself if I'm
[01:08:48] not even fully reading the question
[01:08:50] sometimes sometimes I'm reading just L
[01:08:53] like literally the words that I'm
[01:08:54] reading is like tell me what the and I'm
[01:08:57] like oh yeah tell me what the I know
[01:08:58] which flash cut that is because I only
[01:09:00] have one flash cut that's worded in that
[01:09:01] specific way that's no longer testing
[01:09:04] your ability to retrieve that knowledge
[01:09:05] in any way that's meaningful anymore and
[01:09:08] so what we're doing is we're falling
[01:09:10] into this illusion and so I would sit
[01:09:12] these tests and there would be this
[01:09:15] question that asks about that exact same
[01:09:17] fact or the exact same concept and it
[01:09:20] just doesn't come to me I get a blank or
[01:09:22] I only think about it after the exam or
[01:09:24] I know know that I've studied it but I
[01:09:26] just cannot summon that knowledge and
[01:09:28] use it in the way that I need to and
[01:09:29] it's incredibly frustrating experience
[01:09:31] which you probably felt before that
[01:09:33] happens when we rely a little bit too
[01:09:34] much on the cues and so I often say that
[01:09:36] if you're using um a method of queued
[01:09:40] recall you should always be switching up
[01:09:41] those cues always be switching up those
[01:09:43] prompts so that you're authentically
[01:09:45] testing your knowledge now the benefit
[01:09:48] of free recall that often isn't there in
[01:09:50] cued recall is that free recall allows
[01:09:53] you to do more elaborate
[01:09:55] types of recall you're able to use your
[01:09:58] knowledge in a more integrated way
[01:10:00] because the scope of it is much wider
[01:10:03] for example a great example of a free
[01:10:07] recall active recall strategy that
[01:10:11] creates an integrated schema is teaching
[01:10:14] to a
[01:10:15] 10-year-old you know often uh people
[01:10:17] call this the Fineman method even though
[01:10:20] Fineman technically I I'm pretty sure
[01:10:22] fan didn't actually describe this method
[01:10:24] but anyway everyone understands there a
[01:10:26] fan method which is taking a topic and
[01:10:28] then being able to teach it to a
[01:10:29] 10-year-old and the reason that this
[01:10:30] works is because when you teach a topic
[01:10:33] you're having to freely recall it there
[01:10:36] isn't it's not a set structure that's
[01:10:38] given to you you have to create that
[01:10:40] structure and that means you have to
[01:10:41] compare and contrast ideas and concepts
[01:10:43] with each other and that helps promote
[01:10:45] that schema formation you're making a
[01:10:47] judgment at an integrated level but also
[01:10:49] by adding the two at 10-year-old you're
[01:10:51] having to simplify that information so
[01:10:54] you're having to crit evaluate it even
[01:10:56] more you're having to make a judgment
[01:10:57] about what is or is not important this
[01:11:00] is the difference between something like
[01:11:01] teaching to a 10-year-old versus a brain
[01:11:04] dump a brain dump is simply just tell me
[01:11:08] everything that you know about this
[01:11:09] topic it's a free recall exercise and it
[01:11:12] can be very effective however it doesn't
[01:11:15] Force us to evaluate that knowledge to a
[01:11:17] deeper extent it's very possible to do a
[01:11:20] isolated brain dump just here's every
[01:11:23] single fact that I can think of just
[01:11:25] laid out there whereas when we're
[01:11:28] teaching and especially teaching in a
[01:11:30] simplified way we have to piece it
[01:11:33] together we have to create a big picture
[01:11:35] we have to think about analogies we have
[01:11:37] to think about the order in which we're
[01:11:38] going to introduce ideas to see what
[01:11:41] makes sense and to know what makes sense
[01:11:44] we having to make these decisions about
[01:11:45] what is more important than another how
[01:11:48] does this concept relate to this later
[01:11:49] concept and therefore this becomes a
[01:11:52] really effective strategy to use if
[01:11:53] you're not already using it now the
[01:11:55] final thing about picking a retrieval
[01:11:57] strategy is I often say that you need to
[01:12:01] practice how you
[01:12:03] play so imagine you are using a teaching
[01:12:06] strategy teaching it to a 10-year-old
[01:12:08] that's great you're going to be able to
[01:12:11] reinforce your knowledge your knowledge
[01:12:12] is going to get deeper your attention is
[01:12:14] going to get stronger however let's say
[01:12:17] that the way you need to use this
[01:12:18] knowledge in your exam or at work the
[01:12:22] way you need to apply it is through
[01:12:25] coding a certain app if that's the way
[01:12:28] you need to use the knowledge then
[01:12:30] teaching about how you would code the
[01:12:33] app still creates a gap between the
[01:12:36] level of knowledge you need to get to
[01:12:38] and the level of knowledge you're
[01:12:39] testing and reinforcing at and this is
[01:12:42] because there is a differentiation of
[01:12:45] knowledge which often is differentiated
[01:12:48] as
[01:12:49] procedural knowledge versus
[01:12:52] declarative knowledge versus conditional
[01:12:56] knowledge and in simple terms this means
[01:12:59] that not only do we need to know what
[01:13:02] which is the
[01:13:03] declarative we also need to know how to
[01:13:07] apply it or use it and to to execute on
[01:13:10] it which is the procedural and we need
[01:13:12] to know when and why which is the
[01:13:17] conditional knowledge so if we use
[01:13:19] coding because coding is a great example
[01:13:22] there is a declarative knowledge
[01:13:24] component which is understanding the
[01:13:26] language learning about the language
[01:13:28] learning about the syntax understanding
[01:13:30] how to build certain functions for what
[01:13:32] purpose and how those different
[01:13:34] functions come together if you don't
[01:13:36] have this declarative knowledge you're
[01:13:38] going to struggle to create a strategy
[01:13:40] create a plan for an app that you want
[01:13:42] to build if you don't have the
[01:13:45] procedural knowledge though the
[01:13:47] procedural knowledge is your ability to
[01:13:49] actually create that bug free code and
[01:13:52] build the app you may know the approach
[01:13:54] you may know how it all comes together
[01:13:56] but when it comes to actually writing
[01:13:57] the code you can't quite remember
[01:14:00] exactly how it's meant to fit together
[01:14:03] and your you know your code is full of
[01:14:05] errors and all sorts of things the
[01:14:06] procedural knowledge also has to be
[01:14:09] there to supplement the declarative
[01:14:10] knowledge and the conditional knowledge
[01:14:12] is about having almost you can think of
[01:14:13] it as almost wisdom knowing that there
[01:14:16] are many different types of approaches
[01:14:18] and ways that you can tackle something
[01:14:19] but when and why one approach or one
[01:14:23] feature or one
[01:14:25] uh function is more appropriate than
[01:14:28] another another example would be in
[01:14:31] mathematics or physics there is a
[01:14:33] declarative component which often in
[01:14:36] mathematics is very very very
[01:14:39] underemphasized and most people do not
[01:14:41] learn the declarative part very well
[01:14:44] which tells you why the equations and
[01:14:47] different concepts that you learning
[01:14:49] about in math do what they do how to use
[01:14:52] those equations and how to transform
[01:14:54] your
[01:14:55] problem into something that you can
[01:14:56] actually solve this means that when you
[01:14:58] look at a math problem you know how to
[01:15:01] approach it and what sequence you need
[01:15:03] to use to unpack it and get to a
[01:15:06] solution the procedural part is being
[01:15:08] able to actually solve the equations
[01:15:10] accurately and so you can see that if
[01:15:12] you don't have the declarative and the
[01:15:14] procedural you're not going to be able
[01:15:16] to actually use the knowledge in the way
[01:15:18] that you need to and so what we need to
[01:15:20] do is we need to think about how will I
[01:15:22] need to use my knowledge and therefore
[01:15:24] how can I make sure that I'm practicing
[01:15:26] how I play if I know I need to code an
[01:15:29] app I should be trying to code apps as
[01:15:32] part of my retrieval practice strategies
[01:15:36] if I know I need to solve math problems
[01:15:37] I should be solving problems at varying
[01:15:40] levels of complexity to match the type
[01:15:42] of challenge that I know I'm going to
[01:15:44] face if I'm learning a language same
[01:15:46] thing if I'm playing an instrument
[01:15:47] whatever it is that you're learning you
[01:15:48] should be matching the practice with how
[01:15:51] you play a really common area where I
[01:15:53] see people almost never do this is when
[01:15:55] it comes to writing essays they think
[01:15:57] about writing essays as almost entirely
[01:16:00] this procedural activity and all they do
[01:16:02] is just practice just writing things
[01:16:04] down without actually thinking about how
[01:16:06] they're organizing their ideas and their
[01:16:09] themes and stringing together a
[01:16:10] narrative which is actually the thing
[01:16:12] that makes the essay and the contents of
[01:16:14] it good it doesn't matter how good the
[01:16:16] procedural part is it's still going to
[01:16:18] not read very well and make a lot of
[01:16:20] sense and it's going to lack a lot of
[01:16:21] that depth if you don't have the
[01:16:22] declarative knowledge to back it up and
[01:16:25] in almost everything you will ever learn
[01:16:28] there is usually a combination for most
[01:16:32] procedurally heavy subjects there is
[01:16:34] often a declarative component and that
[01:16:36] declarative component is often a high
[01:16:38] yield area that if you were to focus on
[01:16:41] will probably make more of a difference
[01:16:42] to your results and your performance
[01:16:44] than the procedural part so here's a
[01:16:46] couple of different retrieval strategies
[01:16:48] and let's see how they stack up to this
[01:16:50] criteria let's say that we are doing
[01:16:52] practice papers practice exams great so
[01:16:56] is it a good technique does it help us
[01:16:59] create an integrated schema of knowledge
[01:17:02] well it depends on the questions that
[01:17:04] we're being asked so that actually
[01:17:06] depends you can look at the types of
[01:17:07] questions you're asking and make that
[01:17:09] assessment for yourself especially if
[01:17:11] you're creating questions using
[01:17:13] something like AI which is a great
[01:17:16] strategy to use if you don't have just
[01:17:18] like a bunch of practice material
[01:17:19] available to you make sure that you're
[01:17:22] prompting it to create questions for you
[01:17:24] that are integrator that are testing you
[01:17:26] at higher levels a great prompt that you
[01:17:28] can just use is to say create questions
[01:17:31] for me along the spectrum of Bloom's
[01:17:34] taxonomy levels 2 to 5 and it will know
[01:17:40] what that means what about the next
[01:17:41] criteria active recall especially making
[01:17:44] it free or diverse cued recall again it
[01:17:49] depends it depends on how we're
[01:17:51] answering it if you're answering it like
[01:17:52] how I was answering practice questions
[01:17:54] back in high school where I'm just
[01:17:55] checking the answer straight away then
[01:17:58] that's a lot less effective or if you're
[01:18:00] really trying to do it in test
[01:18:02] conditions making sure that you're
[01:18:03] really generating and testing your
[01:18:05] ability to retrieve that knowledge down
[01:18:07] to the detail and really forcing
[01:18:09] yourself to create that knowledge and
[01:18:13] actually write it down or speak it then
[01:18:16] yes that's going to be a lot better and
[01:18:18] the third criteria does it help you to
[01:18:20] practice how you play so again if those
[01:18:23] questions are geared in a way that's
[01:18:25] very similar to how you need to use that
[01:18:27] knowledge in the actual exam then yes
[01:18:30] that's fine if you're learning it for
[01:18:31] work or something that's not an
[01:18:33] examination again think how will I need
[01:18:35] to use this knowledge and therefore what
[01:18:37] type of tests can I give myself so
[01:18:40] practice questions is it a good strategy
[01:18:44] to
[01:18:46] use it depends it can be great but it
[01:18:50] can also be a surprising waste of time
[01:18:54] okay now let's look at a another type of
[01:18:56] retrieval strategy which is rereading or
[01:19:00] rewriting notes or maybe let's take it a
[01:19:03] step higher and say that we're not just
[01:19:04] rewriting them but we're trying to
[01:19:06] summarize those notes as well as we
[01:19:08] rewrite them is it helping us form an
[01:19:10] integrated
[01:19:12] schema not much it's the summarization
[01:19:16] aspect of it probably helps us to think
[01:19:18] about it at a big picture level a little
[01:19:21] bit more we are still operating in a
[01:19:24] relatively isolated way unless your
[01:19:27] summary is like radically different from
[01:19:31] the isolated version of that information
[01:19:33] like what you're creating is not even a
[01:19:34] summary it's almost just like a
[01:19:37] synthesized uh review of the topic that
[01:19:39] you have sort of like pieced together
[01:19:41] and like completely rearranged which
[01:19:43] most people are not doing then most of
[01:19:45] the time creating summary notes is not
[01:19:47] going to be overtly very effective
[01:19:49] compared to what else you could be
[01:19:51] spending that time doing what about
[01:19:52] active recall so again it depends are
[01:19:55] you creating the summary notes based on
[01:19:57] your memory or are you just looking at
[01:19:59] your existing notes and just summarizing
[01:20:01] it and then just writing it down
[01:20:02] straight away so again depending on
[01:20:04] whether it's purely from your memory
[01:20:06] depending on how open you are with with
[01:20:08] restructuring and summarizing it um and
[01:20:11] versus how just paragraph by paragraph
[01:20:14] you're going through it which is much
[01:20:16] more isolated the level of Effectiveness
[01:20:18] here really varies but again most of the
[01:20:21] time it's not going to be extreme High
[01:20:24] levels of free recall that's allowing
[01:20:26] you to do lots of elaboration and a lot
[01:20:28] of the time you're referring to your
[01:20:29] notes that's right next to you as well
[01:20:32] so you're not even really doing a lot of
[01:20:35] active recall from your memory and is it
[01:20:38] helping you practice how you play unless
[01:20:41] the way that you need to use the
[01:20:43] information is to take existing
[01:20:45] information and to just provide a
[01:20:47] summary of it not really so a technique
[01:20:52] like summary notes
[01:20:55] notes is I would give that
[01:20:58] overall probably not worth the time
[01:21:01] compared to the Alternatives now if
[01:21:04] you've been using sumary nodes and
[01:21:05] you're saying Justin I disagree with you
[01:21:08] wholeheartedly I'm I'm ready to to start
[01:21:10] a war with you based on that statement
[01:21:12] summary War summary notes are amazing
[01:21:14] for me well then here's what I'm saying
[01:21:16] is that if you think summary notes are
[01:21:18] great for you then using some of these
[01:21:20] other strategies that do hit all of
[01:21:22] these boxes then you're going to have
[01:21:24] your mind mind blown because the benefit
[01:21:26] you're feeling from the summary notes
[01:21:29] probably just comes from those brief
[01:21:31] Parts where it is helping you to have a
[01:21:33] more integrated schema where you are
[01:21:35] using slightly more active recall or
[01:21:38] free recall or where it does happen to
[01:21:41] align a little bit more with practicing
[01:21:43] how you play but if you create a
[01:21:45] technique and modify that so that it is
[01:21:48] fully aligned with these criteria it's
[01:21:51] going to be even more effective and so
[01:21:53] again what I'm saying is not that if
[01:21:55] you're doing summary notes you know you
[01:21:57] should be banished to um you know
[01:21:59] inefficiency prison uh but it's just to
[01:22:02] call out that there are things that you
[01:22:05] can always optimize about techniques and
[01:22:07] if a technique is working for you it's
[01:22:09] important to understand why it's working
[01:22:11] for you and how you can make it better
[01:22:13] and which parts of the techniques that
[01:22:15] you're using are probably holding you
[01:22:17] back and wasting time which you can
[01:22:19] remove and it's this process of constant
[01:22:22] iteration evaluation and back and forth
[01:22:25] that produces a effective learner so
[01:22:28] we've talked about a lot of stuff let's
[01:22:29] quickly recap we've talked about the
[01:22:32] fact that in order to achieve our goals
[01:22:34] we need to have a high retention and we
[01:22:36] need to have a high level of Mastery
[01:22:39] what that means is that we need to form
[01:22:41] integrated schemas of knowledge that
[01:22:44] process to form integrated schema of
[01:22:46] knowledge this is what allows us to
[01:22:48] achieve that high level of retention and
[01:22:49] high level of Mastery we've talked about
[01:22:52] the fact that it's possible for us to to
[01:22:54] improve our ability to do this type of
[01:22:58] thinking and to learn more effectively
[01:22:59] because of
[01:23:01] neuroplasticity and that when we make
[01:23:03] that a new habit it becomes faster and
[01:23:07] by the way that's the thing that helps
[01:23:08] us with the time being able to do those
[01:23:10] processes faster as they become habits
[01:23:13] but in order to turn those into habits
[01:23:16] it requires a level of pressure that has
[01:23:18] to be sustained at a level of duration
[01:23:20] and intensity to create that change in
[01:23:23] our brain and a lot of the time most
[01:23:27] Learners misinterpret that pressure of
[01:23:30] effective learning or of new habits
[01:23:33] forming with ineffective and they say
[01:23:36] because it's difficult it's hard to use
[01:23:38] I'm not used to it therefore it's not
[01:23:41] working for me and then they will leave
[01:23:44] the improvements at the door and they
[01:23:46] won't pursue down that path to really
[01:23:48] get the benefit of it we then talked
[01:23:50] about what is the right way to learn
[01:23:54] what are the processes that when we use
[01:23:56] create that schema we talked about
[01:23:58] Active Learning being that process of
[01:24:00] using our brain and it has to be
[01:24:02] involved in that process and anything
[01:24:03] that creates the passive learning is not
[01:24:06] going to help us and that our ability to
[01:24:09] learn is not fixed rather it is
[01:24:12] something that we can train and that we
[01:24:14] can grow across multiple different
[01:24:17] modalities and it's about evaluating and
[01:24:19] assessing that that produces a better
[01:24:22] learner and then we focus specifically
[01:24:25] on the idea of retrieval practice as one
[01:24:28] strategy that is going to be a very
[01:24:31] useful starting point for you to improve
[01:24:34] your learning abilities and remember
[01:24:35] more of what you read and learn
[01:24:38] specifically we talked about the ideas
[01:24:40] of making sure that the retrieval
[01:24:42] strategy we use has a level of spacing
[01:24:45] in it but we're also creating integrated
[01:24:49] schemas we're using active recall and
[01:24:52] we're practicing how you play I know
[01:24:54] that this will be a comment what is the
[01:24:57] best spacing interval a rule of thumb
[01:24:59] that I generally say is review
[01:25:01] everything you
[01:25:02] learn
[01:25:04] after one day and then one week and then
[01:25:08] one month but this varies a lot
[01:25:11] depending on your time management and
[01:25:12] and what else you've go got going on
[01:25:15] like if you wanted to review it 3 hours
[01:25:17] later instead of a whole day later I'd
[01:25:19] say yeah okay that's that that's fine if
[01:25:21] instead of one week later you said two
[01:25:23] weeks later I'd say okay yeah that that
[01:25:25] can work and in instead of one month you
[01:25:26] said okay what about every 3 weeks or
[01:25:28] what about every six weeks I'd say yeah
[01:25:30] that's probably fine as well I mean it's
[01:25:32] really just about having the consistency
[01:25:34] of the spacing uh more than just really
[01:25:36] getting that spacing algorithm super
[01:25:38] super tight the research does not
[01:25:40] clearly show that that makes that big of
[01:25:43] a difference uh what makes vastly more
[01:25:46] of a difference is what you're doing
[01:25:47] during those spacing
[01:25:50] sessions um and making sure that that
[01:25:51] retrieval strategy that you're using
[01:25:53] abides by these
[01:25:55] principles so if you have a method of
[01:25:58] study right now that has the spacing and
[01:26:01] it abides by these principles of a
[01:26:03] schema active recoil and practicing how
[01:26:05] you play then what else would be left
[01:26:06] for you well as I mentioned before there
[01:26:09] is the other side of the coin which is
[01:26:11] how we do our encoding now I'm not going
[01:26:14] to talk at length about the research on
[01:26:17] how to do effective
[01:26:19] encoding uh as a quick reminder encoding
[01:26:22] refers to the process we use when we
[01:26:24] first learn information and this heavily
[01:26:27] affects our knowledge Decay when we
[01:26:29] encode information very effectively to
[01:26:32] begin with it means that we forget less
[01:26:34] there's less stuff we need to repeat and
[01:26:35] retrieve on in the first place and
[01:26:37] ultimately it makes our lives easier
[01:26:39] because we just retain more naturally
[01:26:42] but the reason even though this is
[01:26:44] really incredibly powerful and I think
[01:26:46] this is one of the most impactful things
[01:26:48] that um we we teach in in my program at
[01:26:50] I can
[01:26:51] study the reason I'm not going into this
[01:26:53] one in in a lot of depth is because the
[01:26:56] research on what is or is not effective
[01:26:58] en coding is extremely complicated and
[01:27:02] so what I'm going to leave you with is a
[01:27:04] summary of the principles that we know
[01:27:09] you can safely say if you're trying to
[01:27:11] do this with your encoding it's going to
[01:27:13] be a it's going to be a good bit so
[01:27:17] here's the first thing is number one and
[01:27:20] this is probably the most unifying
[01:27:23] principle that you need to make make
[01:27:24] sure that you're hitting is always
[01:27:26] relate information to the big picture
[01:27:30] ask yourself what is the purpose of
[01:27:32] learning this where does this fit in the
[01:27:35] big picture of this topic it fits
[01:27:37] somewhere where does it fit in relation
[01:27:39] to everything else that I'm learning
[01:27:42] number two try to
[01:27:44] simplify what you learn and these two
[01:27:46] things work together you learn new
[01:27:49] information at the time that you learn
[01:27:51] that information aim to simplify it to
[01:27:54] the point where you can simply see how
[01:27:56] it fits into a simple big picture look
[01:28:00] for the simpler Concepts look for the
[01:28:03] simpler ideas build that big picture in
[01:28:06] the simplest way in the fastest way
[01:28:09] first what this does is that increases
[01:28:12] that overall Network the overall schema
[01:28:16] this is referred to as
[01:28:18] scaffolding it's this idea that the end
[01:28:21] goal of the level of detail that you may
[01:28:23] want to have is is very very high but
[01:28:26] right now we need to scaffold our way up
[01:28:30] to that level of detail we're not ready
[01:28:32] to learn every single detail and for
[01:28:35] that to stick into our brain it's not
[01:28:36] realistic because our brain is going to
[01:28:38] forget it if we go all the way back to
[01:28:40] what we talked about before human
[01:28:42] cognitive architecture and this idea of
[01:28:44] schema Theory we know that the brain is
[01:28:46] very efficient at learning but it is way
[01:28:49] more efficient at forgetting and as soon
[01:28:52] as you take information that's
[01:28:54] irrelevant you're fighting a losing
[01:28:56] battle you're never going to beat your
[01:28:58] brain forgetting information if it
[01:29:00] doesn't think it's relevant because
[01:29:03] learning is an incredibly energy
[01:29:04] consuming thing for your brain's
[01:29:06] perspective it's trying to conserve
[01:29:07] energy it's trying to keep you alive it
[01:29:09] doesn't care about your exam it cares
[01:29:10] about keeping you alive so it's not
[01:29:13] going to hold on to information if it's
[01:29:14] not relevant and so therefore what we
[01:29:15] need to do is we need to say hey this is
[01:29:18] relevant and unfortunately we can't just
[01:29:20] say this is going to come up in my exam
[01:29:22] please remember it I need to know it
[01:29:24] it's relevant that doesn't work
[01:29:26] unfortunately otherwise learning will be
[01:29:28] very very easy in order for our brain to
[01:29:31] be convinced that this new piece of
[01:29:34] information is relevant it needs to fit
[01:29:36] somewhere it needs to see that it's
[01:29:38] connected to something else it needs to
[01:29:40] see that this information has an
[01:29:41] influence on other pieces of information
[01:29:44] and that means that when we are studying
[01:29:46] we need to take the time and the effort
[01:29:48] to deliberately look for those
[01:29:50] connections to build that to understand
[01:29:53] that big picture and once we have a
[01:29:55] simple understanding then we can number
[01:29:58] three learn in layers we add on another
[01:30:02] layer on top of the scaffold of extra
[01:30:05] detail and then we see how that detail
[01:30:07] fits into the big picture and then we
[01:30:08] add on on another layer of extra detail
[01:30:11] and again see how that fits into the big
[01:30:13] picture something like mind maps which
[01:30:16] you those of you have been following me
[01:30:17] for while know that I teach uh very
[01:30:19] extensively mind maps are a great tool
[01:30:22] for doing this but my Ms are a
[01:30:24] absolutely useless tool if you're not
[01:30:27] using them in this way if you're trying
[01:30:30] to just study you know writing notes in
[01:30:33] just like a passive way if your brain is
[01:30:34] not really actively involved in the
[01:30:36] process of figuring out the big picture
[01:30:38] simplifying it creating relationships
[01:30:40] forming a schema adding on layers if
[01:30:42] that's not what your brain is trying to
[01:30:44] do then it doesn't matter what your hand
[01:30:46] is doing whether it's creating a my map
[01:30:48] or typing out notes it's all going to be
[01:30:52] much less effective and this is the part
[01:30:54] where teaching about an encoding
[01:30:57] strategy isn't as romantic as easy
[01:31:01] sometimes as a retrieval strategy
[01:31:02] because I can't just say hey teach it to
[01:31:04] a 10-year-old that's a technique that
[01:31:06] you can use because the majority of what
[01:31:09] produces the benefit of proper encoding
[01:31:11] is actually just how you think you can
[01:31:14] use an extremely rudimentary technique
[01:31:19] like literally just reading a book and
[01:31:22] if you think in this way as you reading
[01:31:26] the quality of your knowledge will be
[01:31:28] incomparable to someone that's reading
[01:31:30] it passively so you can take literally
[01:31:32] any technique any study technique that
[01:31:35] exists and if you think about it in this
[01:31:38] way it becomes more efficient and it
[01:31:41] becomes more effective the knowledge
[01:31:42] quality is much higher and this is the
[01:31:44] reason why you can't just copy
[01:31:46] successful students because a lot of
[01:31:48] successful students they are doing this
[01:31:50] encoding process at a much higher level
[01:31:52] because of their uh their existing
[01:31:54] habits of learning and again some of it
[01:31:57] is genetic as well we call this deep
[01:31:59] processing and when this deep processing
[01:32:02] is is is already at a high level you can
[01:32:05] use any technique and you can do very
[01:32:08] very well because your brain is just
[01:32:11] building that knowledge effectively and
[01:32:13] you don't need necessarily all these
[01:32:15] other techniques now if you have great
[01:32:16] de processing and then you use a
[01:32:18] technique that
[01:32:20] facilitates this all of this great
[01:32:22] encoding and Fa facilitates those
[01:32:24] natural processes then you're going to
[01:32:26] be unstoppable but most top Achievers
[01:32:30] just out there in the wild they don't
[01:32:33] have great techniques they actually have
[01:32:34] very mediocre techniques but they've got
[01:32:36] excellent deep processing and they're
[01:32:37] able to do this encoding very very well
[01:32:40] but again you can learn it you can learn
[01:32:42] it and you can train yourself to do it
[01:32:44] and when you train yourself to do that
[01:32:46] you can achieve those results that
[01:32:48] usually only those Geniuses uh are able
[01:32:52] to achieve but it does take time and
[01:32:54] actually this is the final point that I
[01:32:57] want to talk about which is how long
[01:33:00] does it take if you're just starting
[01:33:02] this journey to get to a point where
[01:33:04] you're able to do all of this stuff you
[01:33:06] have gr encoding you've trained and
[01:33:08] reprogrammed your brain on how to think
[01:33:09] about things you have a great Learning
[01:33:11] System with good retrieval practices
[01:33:14] that's in there how long can you expect
[01:33:17] it will take for you to basically Master
[01:33:18] this the first question is that if you
[01:33:22] want to master this it's going to take
[01:33:24] you several years even with constant
[01:33:28] diligent effort but the good news is
[01:33:30] that you don't need to master
[01:33:34] this so this is where there's not a
[01:33:37] whole lot of research the idea of
[01:33:40] actually training these skills and
[01:33:41] Learners is
[01:33:43] extremely
[01:33:44] extremely novel um and training it at
[01:33:48] this like systematically in the way that
[01:33:51] it you know I've kind of talked about it
[01:33:52] now where it's a IC picture uh the
[01:33:55] program that I run I can study is the
[01:33:57] first program to ever try to actually do
[01:33:59] that at a cognitive level and so what
[01:34:01] I'll talk about now is a little bit of
[01:34:02] the data that I've observed to give you
[01:34:05] an expectation about how long some of
[01:34:08] these things might take and kind of the
[01:34:10] interesting things about what seems to
[01:34:12] make the biggest difference in people
[01:34:14] that are able to learn and retrain
[01:34:16] themselves very quickly versus people
[01:34:17] that take like years and barely improve
[01:34:19] at all I would probably generally say
[01:34:21] that if you're not actively pursuing
[01:34:24] improving your learning skills you're
[01:34:26] not actively trying to retrain yourself
[01:34:28] on how you're thinking it's not a
[01:34:30] priority for you if it's just something
[01:34:31] that you sort of dabble with here and
[01:34:34] there you may never really see a
[01:34:36] noticeable Improvement um or the
[01:34:39] Improvement that you'll see is fairly
[01:34:41] small and will take you like potentially
[01:34:44] decades in fact that's actually really
[01:34:45] common is that a lot of the Learners
[01:34:47] that we come that come into the program
[01:34:49] that have that are like 40 50 60 years
[01:34:51] old they will say that they a lot of the
[01:34:54] things that they figured out across the
[01:34:56] last 30 years of them trying to figure
[01:34:58] out how to learn these are things that
[01:35:00] we teach them in like the first five
[01:35:02] lessons and that's because just that
[01:35:05] rate of neuroplastic change that
[01:35:07] pressure if you're not maintaining that
[01:35:09] if it's not at a certain level and
[01:35:11] you're not really really actively
[01:35:12] monitoring it the just the rate that you
[01:35:15] grow at is so so so so slow and so
[01:35:19] that's the first thing is that most
[01:35:21] people never really learn how to
[01:35:25] remember more of what they read or learn
[01:35:27] because they never give themselves the
[01:35:29] opportunity opportunity to and they're
[01:35:31] not in the in that Journey for long
[01:35:33] enough so let's assume that you are then
[01:35:36] how long does it take we normally see
[01:35:38] that after the first month there are
[01:35:42] noticeable changes in your ability to
[01:35:46] remember and have that retention or have
[01:35:49] that depth of Mastery or at least just
[01:35:52] understanding what's holding you back
[01:35:53] from that and so even if your retention
[01:35:55] and Mastery hasn't already improved you
[01:35:59] know why it hasn't improved and you're
[01:36:01] actually taking steps to like
[01:36:03] systematically unlock that we'd normally
[01:36:06] expect that within about the first 3 to
[01:36:09] five weeks for for the vast majority of
[01:36:12] students and if that's not the case it
[01:36:14] probably means that there's uh an issue
[01:36:16] somewhere and I'm going to talk about
[01:36:17] what the biggest issue is in just a
[01:36:19] moment getting to a point where you have
[01:36:23] increase your learning efficiency and
[01:36:26] your retention and your Mastery is about
[01:36:28] 30 to 50% higher than it was before and
[01:36:31] the time it takes for you to reach that
[01:36:34] um level is about 30 to 50% less than it
[01:36:36] used to be we' normally expect that that
[01:36:38] can happen within the first 1 to 3
[01:36:42] months the biggest thing that makes a
[01:36:45] difference to how quickly someone
[01:36:46] improves the range is massive someone
[01:36:49] that improves by let's say 30% and it
[01:36:52] takes them one month to get there versus
[01:36:56] another person who learns the same
[01:36:59] methods it could realistically take them
[01:37:02] 3 years to achieve the exact same level
[01:37:05] of result and without data from over
[01:37:08] 10,000 Learners that we've evaluated and
[01:37:11] done surveys and and and um assessments
[01:37:13] on what that data has shown is that the
[01:37:16] variable that seems to make the biggest
[01:37:18] difference on how quickly someone
[01:37:19] improves is actually how willing they
[01:37:23] are
[01:37:24] to make mistakes and what we found is
[01:37:27] that the students who go into this
[01:37:30] wanting to just learn the best technique
[01:37:33] learn it in a single go and basically
[01:37:35] this misinterpreted effort thing that I
[01:37:37] talked about they are not appreciating
[01:37:39] the fact that this is a skill that takes
[01:37:40] trial and error to learn they put off
[01:37:43] making these mistakes and they they try
[01:37:46] it like once a week whereas the people
[01:37:48] that are just like I'm committed to just
[01:37:50] learning this and figuring it out and
[01:37:52] learning from those mistakes they're
[01:37:53] making a mistake every 1 or two hours
[01:37:56] they're just like trying it seeing it
[01:37:57] trying it seeing it and so they're
[01:37:59] learning like 10 20 times faster and
[01:38:02] developing that skill 10 to 20 times
[01:38:03] faster than the people that are really
[01:38:06] resistant to trying it and and actually
[01:38:09] giving it a go and making those mistakes
[01:38:11] that's the reason why deliberately
[01:38:13] teaching Frameworks for how to change
[01:38:15] that mindset became an integral part of
[01:38:18] the early part of our program um because
[01:38:21] we found that that was actually like it
[01:38:22] wasn't the learning skills it wasn't a
[01:38:24] time management it wasn't task
[01:38:25] management it wasn't the prioritization
[01:38:27] like it wasn't any of that it was just
[01:38:29] the fact that people didn't understand
[01:38:31] how to turn mistakes into learning and
[01:38:35] therefore have the confidence to be able
[01:38:36] to make the mistake because they know
[01:38:38] that that's going to help them improve
[01:38:39] their result so if that's you and you're
[01:38:41] thinking yeah that's the thing that's
[01:38:42] probably going to hold me back like you
[01:38:43] don't need to wait for anything else
[01:38:45] like I don't need to tell it to you
[01:38:46] again if you know that something that
[01:38:48] you need to work on take the stuff that
[01:38:50] you've learned from this video watch
[01:38:51] some of my other videos join the program
[01:38:53] PR if you like take the techniques give
[01:38:56] them a go make some mistakes learn from
[01:38:58] those mistakes and then accelerate your
[01:39:00] growth that way so that's the overall
[01:39:04] guide and even though I went through a
[01:39:06] lot of stuff this is only like honestly
[01:39:11] it's like less than 1% of the scope of
[01:39:14] the research there are so many other
[01:39:16] things that are important to to talk
[01:39:20] about and to understand about learning
[01:39:21] it's a very complicated process like I
[01:39:23] mention and I've spent the last 13 years
[01:39:27] going through like volumes of research
[01:39:29] papers trying to figure this out and
[01:39:31] turn it into something actionable for
[01:39:33] you so for those of you that are
[01:39:36] interested in diving a little bit deeper
[01:39:37] into the research I'll leave the links
[01:39:39] to the articles that I think are really
[01:39:41] great starting points for you and if
[01:39:42] there's anything that I talked about
[01:39:43] here or anything that you know about or
[01:39:44] seen in the research that you want me to
[01:39:46] talk about in more depth let me know in
[01:39:47] the comments happy to do that in another
[01:39:49] video and if you are focused on just
[01:39:52] trying to become a bit Lear
[01:39:53] and you want to not necessarily read
[01:39:56] through research for days and try to
[01:39:58] figure this out and you want to just
[01:40:00] learn the package and the system that I
[01:40:02] already figured out just present it to
[01:40:05] you in a guided program for you to
[01:40:07] follow as I mentioned iin study.com
[01:40:10] that's the best place to learn it it's
[01:40:12] where I spend a lot of my time like
[01:40:14] outside of this YouTube thing just
[01:40:17] helping students answering the questions
[01:40:19] doing demonstrations designing programs
[01:40:21] and lessons if you want to join the
[01:40:23] program is ii.com I'll leave a link in
[01:40:24] the description as well thank you so
[01:40:26] much for listening I'd love to hear your
[01:40:27] thoughts in the comments and I'll see
[01:40:28] you in the next one


=== How To Fix Your Attention Span (Before It's Too Late) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHQ7uieciiU

[00:00:00] here's a list of the most common tips
[00:00:02] you'll find on YouTube to fix your
[00:00:05] attention span but unfortunately if you
[00:00:08] are using these tips then you probably
[00:00:11] will not be able to fix your attention
[00:00:13] span or focus and it's not because these
[00:00:16] techniques don't work it's because they
[00:00:18] are Band-Aid Solutions which means
[00:00:20] you're going to be back on YouTube
[00:00:22] tomorrow or maybe a week later but
[00:00:25] definitely within a month just looking
[00:00:27] for those tips again and I don't want
[00:00:29] that for you so in this video I'm going
[00:00:30] to give you a cure rather than a
[00:00:33] Band-Aid for your attention span by
[00:00:35] focusing on the first principle
[00:00:38] fundamentals for focus and distractions
[00:00:42] that are backed by science and the first
[00:00:44] step to curing your attention span is to
[00:00:47] understand your win
[00:00:50] criteria a win criteria is basically
[00:00:53] what needs to happen for you to have won
[00:00:55] so in like if you're playing a game of
[00:00:57] chess you win if you Checkmate them or
[00:01:00] they forfeit most people when it comes
[00:01:02] to focus and attention span have the
[00:01:04] wrong win criteria they think that if
[00:01:07] they use a technique or apply a tip and
[00:01:09] they're able to focus therefore they've
[00:01:11] achieved the win criteria they've solved
[00:01:13] the focus and attention span issue
[00:01:15] that's not how it works I give you an
[00:01:17] example back years ago when I first
[00:01:20] started working out uh I used to just
[00:01:22] want to like throw heavy weights around
[00:01:26] and I really didn't take care of my
[00:01:27] health as much as I should have and so I
[00:01:30] I had honestly like pretty bad form and
[00:01:32] so I'd hurt my wrist and then I'd hurt
[00:01:34] my shoulder I hurt both shoulders and so
[00:01:37] in order to stop my wrist and my
[00:01:39] shoulders from hurting I got wrist wraps
[00:01:41] and then I did like these like postural
[00:01:43] kind of like activities to stretch my
[00:01:45] shoulders back uh but then I'll just
[00:01:47] like throw this heavy weight round with
[00:01:48] terrible form again and so it aggravate
[00:01:50] the injury and then I had to get like
[00:01:52] even thicker wraps and then I had to
[00:01:54] apply like the Tiger Bomb and I took
[00:01:55] ibuprofen and so I had all of these
[00:01:57] things that I was doing to achieve the
[00:01:59] wi criteria of not being in
[00:02:03] pain which seems like a fair win
[00:02:06] criteria but the problem is not the fact
[00:02:10] that I'm in pain the pain is the symptom
[00:02:13] of the problem the problem was that I
[00:02:16] was doing the exercise incorrectly in
[00:02:18] such a way that it was creating pain
[00:02:20] it's exactly the same thing with focus
[00:02:22] and attention span the wind criteria is
[00:02:24] not being able to sit down and study for
[00:02:27] like a couple of hours with good Focus
[00:02:29] the criteria is being able to do that to
[00:02:34] have good focus and to have good
[00:02:36] attention span without needing so many
[00:02:39] Band-Aid Solutions and techniques and
[00:02:41] tips to get you there because I want you
[00:02:43] to think about your ability to focus and
[00:02:46] have attention like this let's imagine
[00:02:48] that there's this graph here and this
[00:02:51] barrier this is like the wall you need
[00:02:53] to overcome to have good attention this
[00:02:56] is like the the wall of distraction if
[00:02:58] your Baseline level of focus is like
[00:03:01] down here then using a few tips and
[00:03:04] techniques can help you to get over this
[00:03:08] and then you'll be in Focus again but it
[00:03:10] means that every single time you need to
[00:03:13] sit down and do something you need to
[00:03:14] use all those techniques to get you over
[00:03:16] that wall the better solution is just
[00:03:19] fix our innate ability to focus so that
[00:03:23] we don't even need the techniques in the
[00:03:26] first place it's about permanently
[00:03:29] improving our attention span rather than
[00:03:32] temporarily elevating our attention span
[00:03:35] and if you're already feeling this like
[00:03:37] you need even more like you're doing all
[00:03:40] these tips but you still need even more
[00:03:42] and more and more and the effectiveness
[00:03:44] of these tips is like fading away then
[00:03:47] it's very urgent that you work on this
[00:03:50] and you actually improve your inade
[00:03:52] ability and it's urgent because step two
[00:03:55] you got to understand the rules of the
[00:03:57] game that we're playing here
[00:04:00] step two
[00:04:02] understand the rules of the game let's
[00:04:05] say that right now your level of innate
[00:04:07] attention span is pretty low it's it's
[00:04:10] down here somewhere and you're thinking
[00:04:13] that over time I'm sure it will get
[00:04:16] better or you kind of can't be bothered
[00:04:19] training and improving your inade
[00:04:21] attention span that's not going to work
[00:04:23] out well and the reason is that the game
[00:04:26] we're playing right now is one where if
[00:04:30] you do not train your attention span
[00:04:34] it's being untrained for you just by
[00:04:38] living like existing like a normal human
[00:04:40] being in society we are being bombarded
[00:04:44] with constant messages from
[00:04:46] multi-trillion Dollar companies that are
[00:04:48] spending billions of dollars to figure
[00:04:50] out how to hack your attention span and
[00:04:52] keep it attention is the new currency
[00:04:55] and ironically even like me as someone
[00:04:58] who makes YouTube videos I think all the
[00:05:01] time about your attention span and in
[00:05:03] this case to keep it long enough so that
[00:05:06] you actually learn to have a better
[00:05:08] attention span ironic really if you
[00:05:10] don't actively work on your attention
[00:05:12] span over time it will actually just get
[00:05:15] worse which means it will be harder and
[00:05:17] harder and harder to overcome that W and
[00:05:20] actually Focus I had a student a few
[00:05:22] years ago and she would lock herself in
[00:05:25] her garage in fact she would she cleared
[00:05:28] out her garage and only put a desk she'
[00:05:31] go in there no laptop no phone just
[00:05:34] textbook and pen and paper like old
[00:05:35] school and then just study she would
[00:05:37] lock it and then give the family the
[00:05:39] keys uh every time she want to go to the
[00:05:40] bathroom she would have to like knock on
[00:05:42] the door get permission to do that and
[00:05:44] so you know credit to her for taking it
[00:05:47] so seriously but if you're at that point
[00:05:50] where it takes such a level of
[00:05:54] refinement to create Focus it's going to
[00:05:56] be very very hard to achieve difficult
[00:05:58] goals in your life life if you have such
[00:06:00] a narrow scope in which you're able to
[00:06:02] be functional and have deep work but the
[00:06:05] good news is you can train it and you
[00:06:07] can improve that and you should quickly
[00:06:10] in fact you have to train it quickly
[00:06:13] because like I said the rules of the
[00:06:15] game are it's being untrained by default
[00:06:19] so you need to be able to train it
[00:06:22] faster than it's being untrained so what
[00:06:24] do you need to do that's step three
[00:06:27] there are two different types of
[00:06:29] strategies there is a short-term and a
[00:06:32] long-term
[00:06:34] strategy and you do need to use both of
[00:06:37] them your short-term strategy involves
[00:06:39] using techniques and
[00:06:42] tips so I was watching the recording of
[00:06:44] this and then I realized that the
[00:06:45] shortterm versus long-term strategies
[00:06:47] weren't really clear so let me just
[00:06:48] explain really quickly now the
[00:06:50] short-term strategies are the techniques
[00:06:52] and tips that temporarily elevate your
[00:06:55] attention span and then the long-term
[00:06:57] strategies are the ones that permanently
[00:06:59] improve your attention span so that you
[00:07:02] don't need as many of those shortterm
[00:07:06] tips and techniques in the first place
[00:07:07] and then I'm going to explain the
[00:07:08] short-term ones first and instead of
[00:07:11] just explaining to you like all the
[00:07:13] different techniques that you can use
[00:07:15] I've got other videos where I talk about
[00:07:16] this as well if you want like a list of
[00:07:18] the common ones again here it is you can
[00:07:21] take a look at this but honestly the
[00:07:23] value is not really just knowing all of
[00:07:25] these techniques the value is
[00:07:28] understanding how you can solve the
[00:07:30] problem with using these techniques
[00:07:32] which is actually the step
[00:07:35] four which is optimizing the short-term
[00:07:38] strategies the problem with just using
[00:07:40] these techniques is that there are a lot
[00:07:43] of them and some of them work and then
[00:07:44] some of them don't and some of them work
[00:07:46] sometimes and sometimes they don't and
[00:07:47] so it's really difficult to figure out
[00:07:50] which technique or tip to use in what
[00:07:52] type of situation really there are
[00:07:54] actually only two main principles that
[00:07:58] make a big difference to your ability to
[00:08:02] stay focused in the short term and as
[00:08:04] long as whatever technique you're using
[00:08:06] hits these two prerequisites of
[00:08:09] focus it's probably going to be
[00:08:11] effective first prerequisite for having
[00:08:14] really good Focus immediately short term
[00:08:17] is prioritizing deep
[00:08:19] work deep work is basically when you are
[00:08:22] able to really lock in on just a single
[00:08:25] task and enter into the state of flow
[00:08:28] time is flying fing by your brain is
[00:08:30] super engaged just the focus kind of
[00:08:32] comes naturally basically your brain
[00:08:35] working as best as it can it's like your
[00:08:39] peak level of efficiency is unlocked
[00:08:41] when you're able to do deep work so as a
[00:08:44] rule of thumb anything that allows more
[00:08:46] deep work is better for your
[00:08:48] productivity anything that hinders your
[00:08:51] ability to do deep work is going to be
[00:08:53] detal increase your distractions and
[00:08:55] overall unproductive even if it feels
[00:08:57] like you're doing more stuff it's not
[00:08:59] going to be done as quickly and it's not
[00:09:01] going to be done to the same level of
[00:09:02] quality now there's a lot of research on
[00:09:05] what conditions need to be met to enter
[00:09:08] into a deep work state in the first
[00:09:10] place and without boring you with the
[00:09:11] details here is the checklist that I go
[00:09:15] through that allows me to consistently
[00:09:17] enter into a deep work state almost
[00:09:19] every single time number one you want to
[00:09:21] have a clear objective before going into
[00:09:24] any session you want to know exactly
[00:09:26] what the outcome is that you want at the
[00:09:27] end of it don't have a time Block in
[00:09:29] your calendar just just saying study or
[00:09:32] like work be very specific about what it
[00:09:35] is you want to get done in that period
[00:09:37] of time and try not to plan things
[00:09:40] longer than like 1 hour or so be
[00:09:44] specific enough that you know that after
[00:09:46] 15 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes at most
[00:09:48] an hour you know exactly what the output
[00:09:51] you're going for is this helps to create
[00:09:53] this tunnel vision in your mind and it
[00:09:55] gives your brain more Focus number two
[00:09:57] only ever do a singular task at once
[00:10:01] multitasking is not a thing no one can
[00:10:04] really multitask people that are good at
[00:10:07] multitasking they're just switching
[00:10:09] between tasks very quickly and every
[00:10:12] time you switch from one task to another
[00:10:14] it induces something that's called a
[00:10:16] cognitive switching penalty which is
[00:10:18] basically your brain has to switch out
[00:10:21] of the mode of thinking that it's in
[00:10:23] switch to another one and then when you
[00:10:25] switch back it has to sort of remember
[00:10:28] what it was doing and then it takes a
[00:10:30] bit of time for it to get back into
[00:10:32] things and during that period of time
[00:10:34] that's a great opportunity for
[00:10:36] distractions or procrastination to set
[00:10:38] in and also if you're switching very
[00:10:39] often it means that you may be working
[00:10:41] on something for an hour but if you're
[00:10:43] switching every 10 minutes then
[00:10:46] literally half that time might just be
[00:10:49] burned through cognitive switching
[00:10:51] penalty so whenever you're sitting down
[00:10:52] to try to get some work done be very
[00:10:54] clear about what you're trying to
[00:10:55] achieve but make it a singular task
[00:10:57] don't try to do multiple things at the
[00:10:59] same time number three try to prep the
[00:11:01] hard stuff what I mean by this is that
[00:11:03] if you've got a big task that you need
[00:11:04] to do you might feel overwhelmed because
[00:11:06] there's all the stuff you need to unpack
[00:11:08] you know it's going to take a lot of
[00:11:09] work think about what part of that task
[00:11:12] feels the most overwhelming and try to
[00:11:14] do a little bit of that before your
[00:11:16] session something that doesn't really
[00:11:18] require a huge amount of focus it could
[00:11:21] just be planning out a few things
[00:11:23] collecting a few resources the stuff
[00:11:26] that you know is going to make it easier
[00:11:27] for you to jump in and do the when you
[00:11:29] need to by reducing how overwhelming it
[00:11:32] feels and just creating a nice sort of
[00:11:35] package you gifting your future self
[00:11:38] with a head start there's also this
[00:11:40] thing called the zra Nick effect I might
[00:11:43] be pronouncing that wrong but it's
[00:11:45] basically this phenomenon where the
[00:11:47] brain finds it easier to complete tasks
[00:11:50] that we've already started so by taking
[00:11:52] that big overwhelming task and starting
[00:11:54] it in advance we are activating this zga
[00:11:57] Nick aect and making it more motivating
[00:11:58] and more like likely for us to finish
[00:12:00] that task and the final one which this
[00:12:02] is going to sound a little bit strange
[00:12:04] but it is plan to start not to finish
[00:12:08] what this one means is that when you
[00:12:10] have a big task you know that that's
[00:12:12] going to take a lot of work and so
[00:12:14] already your brain looks at that as a
[00:12:17] big piece of work and feels less
[00:12:19] motivated to try to do that it's always
[00:12:21] looking for a shortcut and so if we just
[00:12:23] plan to start and we're not really
[00:12:25] worried about finishing we just plan to
[00:12:28] start and see how far we get and maybe
[00:12:31] as far as we get means that we finish
[00:12:33] but maybe it isn't then what that does
[00:12:35] is it means it's easier for our brain to
[00:12:36] get into it because it knows that it
[00:12:37] doesn't have to commit to this huge big
[00:12:40] amount of cognitive resources so what
[00:12:42] that means is that two things first of
[00:12:44] all we're more likely to just get into
[00:12:46] it without procrastinating but second of
[00:12:48] all because we getting into it and we're
[00:12:50] meeting the other checklist we are able
[00:12:53] to enter into this deep work Flow State
[00:12:56] which means our brain is operating very
[00:12:58] very effici
[00:12:59] so even if we don't finish it what we
[00:13:02] were able to complete is probably the
[00:13:06] best we would have been able to do
[00:13:07] anyway because we're using our brain as
[00:13:09] efficiently as possible and a lot of the
[00:13:11] time when we do get into this Flow State
[00:13:14] it's so easy just to get through work
[00:13:17] that we can finish it there are times
[00:13:19] where I've blocked out like 3 hours to
[00:13:22] do something that I thought was going to
[00:13:23] take a long time I followed this
[00:13:25] checklist I just planned to start and I
[00:13:27] just finished the whole thing in like 45
[00:13:30] minutes never underestimate how much you
[00:13:33] can get done when you're in a state of
[00:13:36] flow now this was the first prerequisite
[00:13:39] if whatever technique and other tip that
[00:13:41] you're using helps you to meet this
[00:13:43] checklist and gets you into deep work
[00:13:46] states it's a good one there's another
[00:13:48] prerequisite the second one is to always
[00:13:51] frontload front loading basically means
[00:13:54] setting yourself up for Success there
[00:13:55] was a study that was done a long time
[00:13:57] ago looking at the brains of people with
[00:14:00] really great discipline and motivation
[00:14:03] versus people without great discipline
[00:14:05] and what they found was that the brain
[00:14:07] activity of the people who were really
[00:14:09] really disciplined wasn't really
[00:14:12] innately that different from the people
[00:14:14] who got easily distracted what they
[00:14:16] found was that there was a
[00:14:17] characteristic behavior that people with
[00:14:20] lots of discipline tend to do which is
[00:14:22] that they will use their time in advance
[00:14:26] to set themselves up for Success later
[00:14:29] for example if you want to go for a run
[00:14:31] then don't hide your running shoes and
[00:14:34] your running clothes like in obscure
[00:14:37] parts of your wardrobe have them right
[00:14:39] there put them on a chair next to the
[00:14:41] door make it easy to access get changed
[00:14:43] into it way in advance of when you need
[00:14:46] to go for the run so you already dress
[00:14:48] all you need to do is get up and go if
[00:14:50] it's about studying think about what
[00:14:52] textbooks you need to have open think
[00:14:54] about what tabs you need to have open on
[00:14:56] your browser what you need to be
[00:14:58] accessing uh What notes you need to be
[00:15:00] writing have all of that stuff set up in
[00:15:02] advance clear your desk make it so that
[00:15:05] the only thing you need to do is just
[00:15:08] start front loading is about thinking
[00:15:10] about every step that needs to happen to
[00:15:14] go from not starting to starting the
[00:15:16] task and it's doing as much of those
[00:15:19] steps in advance as possible and one of
[00:15:21] the best things that you should
[00:15:22] frontload is removing
[00:15:25] distractions most of the time you can
[00:15:27] anticipate what things are going to
[00:15:29] distract you if I'm sitting here trying
[00:15:31] to work and it's loud and people are
[00:15:33] talking that's going to distract me
[00:15:35] that's going to pull me out of my deep
[00:15:37] work so that means that I should have my
[00:15:40] headphones next to me available I should
[00:15:42] know uh what app or what I'm going to
[00:15:44] listen to to block out that distraction
[00:15:46] if I know that there are people uh that
[00:15:49] might come in and disturb me or people
[00:15:50] that might message me I'll put my phone
[00:15:52] on do not disturb or I'll put my phone
[00:15:54] somewhere else these are all the things
[00:15:55] that individually people can think of as
[00:15:58] tips or techniques but it's personalized
[00:16:00] for everyone not everyone needs a
[00:16:02] nuclear option of removing every single
[00:16:04] distraction around them to be able to
[00:16:06] focus and sometimes it's not realistic
[00:16:08] all you need to do is just think about
[00:16:10] what are those distractors that I can
[00:16:12] anticipate that I can predict that are
[00:16:14] likely to come up and what can I do in
[00:16:16] advance so that those things are blocked
[00:16:18] off and it's not enough just to do them
[00:16:20] in advance you have to do them far in
[00:16:24] advance if you're trying to deal with
[00:16:26] all of this stuff at the time you need
[00:16:29] to do the activity that's where you're
[00:16:31] going to get higher likelihood of
[00:16:33] procrastinating or not being bothered or
[00:16:35] following through with the task get all
[00:16:36] that stuff done the day before the night
[00:16:38] before the week before so that when it
[00:16:41] comes time to you actually having to sit
[00:16:44] down and do it there is nothing stopping
[00:16:46] you other than just a tiny little bump
[00:16:50] of motivation and focus that you need
[00:16:51] that was the shortterm strategy what
[00:16:54] about the long-term step five is about
[00:16:58] doing the long longterm
[00:17:00] stuff and if you do step four and
[00:17:04] optimize the short term in terms of deep
[00:17:05] work and frontloading and you train your
[00:17:09] innate ability with step five you will
[00:17:12] solve the focus and attention span
[00:17:14] issues for the rest of your life so how
[00:17:16] do you actually train your focus I want
[00:17:19] you to think of focus like a muscle and
[00:17:21] we're going to call it the focus muscle
[00:17:24] if you go to a gym and you want to train
[00:17:27] your physical muscles you need to pick
[00:17:29] up some weights and that weight is
[00:17:31] relatively heavy there's no point going
[00:17:32] to a gym and then picking up like a
[00:17:34] singular Speck of dust okay you you're
[00:17:37] never going to grow any muscle that way
[00:17:38] it's the same thing with Focus to
[00:17:40] develop our Focus muscle we need to put
[00:17:42] it under some load some pressure
[00:17:45] something that's challenging not so easy
[00:17:48] for it to be meaningless but also not so
[00:17:50] challenging for it to be impossible and
[00:17:52] you don't even need a gym membership to
[00:17:54] train your focus muscle in fact there
[00:17:55] are only three things you need to meet
[00:17:57] to be able to train TR the focus muscle
[00:17:59] number one is Target number two is time
[00:18:04] and number three is
[00:18:06] intensity The Target just means you need
[00:18:08] to have a Target Behavior or Target
[00:18:12] Sensation that you're focused on the
[00:18:15] overall idea is very simple you're going
[00:18:17] to give yourself one Target and try to
[00:18:20] direct your brain to focus on that
[00:18:22] Target at all times so a really easy
[00:18:25] target that's used a lot in lots of
[00:18:27] different types of practices is
[00:18:28] breathing just take slow deep breaths
[00:18:32] and try to focus purely on the breath
[00:18:35] coming in and then going out it seems
[00:18:37] simple but is extremely extremely
[00:18:40] difficult partly because the act of
[00:18:42] breathing in itself is not very engaging
[00:18:45] it's like innately a kind of boring
[00:18:48] thing to do so by picking that kind of
[00:18:50] Target it means that it increases the
[00:18:53] opportunity for ourselves to get
[00:18:55] distracted that applies the pressure the
[00:18:58] load and so if you close your eyes and
[00:19:00] purely try to focus on the breathing
[00:19:03] then after really like 2 or 3 seconds
[00:19:06] you're going to start feeling that there
[00:19:08] are these other distracting thoughts
[00:19:09] coming into your brain and so the way
[00:19:11] that you train the focus muscle is that
[00:19:13] every time you feel that distracting
[00:19:16] thought coming in you bring your
[00:19:18] attention back to the breathing and so
[00:19:21] at first you will get distracted very
[00:19:24] very often like literally once every 2
[00:19:26] or 3 seconds it will take you several
[00:19:30] seconds to even realize you got
[00:19:31] distracted in the first place and it
[00:19:33] will take you several seconds to try to
[00:19:35] bring your focus back and as soon as
[00:19:36] your focus is Back 2 seconds later
[00:19:38] you're distracted again that's very
[00:19:39] normal and what that means is that
[00:19:40] you're getting really good quality
[00:19:42] repetitions in you're getting really
[00:19:43] good uh training for the focus muscle
[00:19:46] and so when you have that Target the
[00:19:48] next thing that you need to do is just
[00:19:50] have more exposure time so if you think
[00:19:53] about every time you get distracted and
[00:19:55] then bring yourself back as one
[00:19:57] repetition that might take you 20 to 30
[00:20:01] seconds so we want to do a number of
[00:20:04] those repetition normally about 20 to 30
[00:20:07] minutes a day means that you can see
[00:20:10] results after a month but even 20 to 30
[00:20:13] minutes is quite daunting for a lot of
[00:20:14] people so if you can just do like 5 or
[00:20:16] 10 minutes as much as you can then it's
[00:20:18] better than nothing and the time is
[00:20:19] necessary because our brain will not
[00:20:22] actually rewire itself if it doesn't
[00:20:24] have enough consistent exposure we
[00:20:27] actually have to forcibly uh put our
[00:20:31] brain in enough level of discomfort for
[00:20:35] a long enough period of time that it
[00:20:37] will rewire itself if we only give
[00:20:40] ourselves a tiny little bit of that
[00:20:42] discomfort from that training like let's
[00:20:44] say we only do 2 3 minutes a day that's
[00:20:47] probably not enough to actually make a
[00:20:49] difference the growth in retraining only
[00:20:52] comes During the period of discomfort so
[00:20:55] until you feel that sense of discomfort
[00:20:58] the the training hasn't really started
[00:21:00] yet and the other thing that's necessary
[00:21:02] other than just time spent training it
[00:21:05] is the intensity of the training so the
[00:21:07] reason I told you to use breathing as a
[00:21:09] Target is because it creates a high
[00:21:11] level of intensity it's a very mundane
[00:21:14] activity so it requires a high level of
[00:21:17] focus to stay on it this is different to
[00:21:20] like for example playing a game I used
[00:21:22] to play a lot of games and I still do
[00:21:24] game actually and I can stay locked in
[00:21:26] for like Hour 2 hours no problem like I
[00:21:29] don't even have to try to stay focused
[00:21:31] when I'm playing a game that's a
[00:21:32] situation where I'm technically staying
[00:21:35] focused but the intensity is very very
[00:21:38] very low because it's too easy the load
[00:21:40] it's it's like lifting a feather and so
[00:21:42] we want to make sure that whatever we're
[00:21:44] setting our Target at it could be
[00:21:45] walking it could be doing the dishes it
[00:21:48] could be gardening or you know just
[00:21:50] breathing like I said but whatever it is
[00:21:53] we want it to be something that is
[00:21:55] simple it needs to be challenging and if
[00:21:58] you engage in this long-term Focus
[00:22:01] muscle training for around about 30 days
[00:22:04] or so of 20 30 minutes a day ideally you
[00:22:08] will start to notice some changes but
[00:22:09] because it requires brain rewiring you
[00:22:13] won't notice any difference within the
[00:22:15] first probably 2 weeks at least it
[00:22:18] doesn't mean that change isn't happening
[00:22:20] it just means that it hasn't happened
[00:22:22] enough for you to notice it yet but
[00:22:24] again if you want to have a focused life
[00:22:28] where you're not always getting
[00:22:29] distracted every single day and feeling
[00:22:31] like your attention span is getting
[00:22:32] smaller and smaller and smaller because
[00:22:34] it actually is then you do need to train
[00:22:38] this and it has to be an active process
[00:22:39] so if you take the long-term strategy
[00:22:41] and you combine it with the two
[00:22:43] prerequisites of focus in the short-term
[00:22:45] strategy you'll be able to not only
[00:22:47] improve your focus today but have your
[00:22:49] focus improving for life as well as
[00:22:52] evaluate any tip or technique that you
[00:22:55] see out there and see whether it's going
[00:22:57] to work or not for you now one more
[00:22:59] short-term strategy that you can apply
[00:23:00] specifically when it comes to studying
[00:23:02] and learning is to make the activity of
[00:23:06] studying innately more engaging
[00:23:09] therefore making it easier for you to
[00:23:10] focus and enter into this deep work
[00:23:12] state and if you're interested in
[00:23:13] learning a little bit more about that
[00:23:14] then I recommend checking out this video
[00:23:16] that I made about that topic here

[00:00:00] people with good grades what are your
[00:00:02] study habits I'm currently in my third
[00:00:06] year of uni in a pre-made program I've
[00:00:08] definitely struggled though but of goals
[00:00:10] of going to Mid school I was hoping this
[00:00:12] year I would finally achieve higher
[00:00:13] grades as I've been putting a lot more
[00:00:16] effort in however I am still yielding
[00:00:19] the same results average my GPA is
[00:00:23] terrible and I continuously get mid 60s
[00:00:25] I won't lie as a semester has gone on I
[00:00:28] keep getting these marks I've have
[00:00:30] pretty much given up I feel like that's
[00:00:33] all I am an average student there's
[00:00:35] nothing wrong with that I just need a
[00:00:37] high average to even be looked at by a
[00:00:39] mid school I feel like I know the
[00:00:41] content for whatever test well I write
[00:00:44] it and do either terrible or average I
[00:00:46] think I just struggle with testing as I
[00:00:48] usually can teach the content to someone
[00:00:50] else here are my current study habits uh
[00:00:54] pre-lecture review before class review
[00:00:56] content about 30 to an hour after class
[00:00:58] not to later TR previous content tackle
[00:01:01] whatever else I need to I also try to
[00:01:03] teach the con to my family I also ask
[00:01:05] chat gbd to make mock tests I do all of
[00:01:07] this consistently and still get 60s I've
[00:01:10] tried changing the amount of time I
[00:01:12] spend on each course the technique and
[00:01:15] study approach but nothing has worked
[00:01:17] it's really discouraging and I feel like
[00:01:20] I may never achieve a single 80% or
[00:01:23] higher in my uni degree please provide
[00:01:26] any advice or tips that have worked for
[00:01:28] you or others
[00:01:30] well uh independent pickle I completely
[00:01:34] understand what that feels like cuz I
[00:01:37] was an exactly the same boat feeling
[00:01:41] like you're trying as hard as you can
[00:01:43] putting in effort in and getting average
[00:01:46] results when I first entered into
[00:01:49] medical school and I realized how much
[00:01:51] harder it was getting through Medical
[00:01:54] School than just getting into medical
[00:01:56] school just cu the
[00:01:57] workload I was I felt like this is
[00:02:00] impossible like there's clearly a part
[00:02:03] of the equation that I was missing and
[00:02:06] so I think for you uh coming into that
[00:02:09] the first thing that I'll just say is
[00:02:10] that there's a lot of good things that
[00:02:13] I'm seeing with what you have said
[00:02:16] here's what I'm here's what I'm noticing
[00:02:18] is that first of all you're asking for
[00:02:21] help like you openminded and willing to
[00:02:25] get help it means you're putting
[00:02:26] yourself in a position where you're
[00:02:28] giving yourself a chance to succeed and
[00:02:29] I think lot of people don't put
[00:02:31] themselves in this position they don't
[00:02:32] ask for help and so just the fact that
[00:02:34] you're asking and posting and being
[00:02:35] honest and transparent about it I think
[00:02:38] it I can see why you're such an
[00:02:40] independent pickle um this is a really
[00:02:43] good sign the other thing that I'm
[00:02:44] seeing is that you're putting in enough
[00:02:46] effort right the effort part of the
[00:02:49] equation is not the issue right so if we
[00:02:52] if we think
[00:02:53] about um effort uh and success as
[00:02:58] success equals
[00:03:01] effort times process then the effort
[00:03:05] part is checked off the only part we we
[00:03:09] can focus purely on the process because
[00:03:10] we know that you're studying enough and
[00:03:12] for most people I would say that if
[00:03:15] you're
[00:03:15] studying more than 5 hours a day you're
[00:03:20] already starting to get to the point
[00:03:21] where just more effort and more time is
[00:03:24] going to be diminishing in your returns
[00:03:27] um if you're not studying very much like
[00:03:29] you're only studying a few hours a day
[00:03:31] and as your methods and processes are
[00:03:32] already really really refined you're
[00:03:34] probably going to be able to get pretty
[00:03:36] good value just by spending more time
[00:03:38] studying but if you're already studying
[00:03:41] 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 hours a day um more
[00:03:46] effort is probably not where it's worth
[00:03:48] spending that extra available time on
[00:03:51] improving it's going to be on focusing
[00:03:53] on the process and speaking of your
[00:03:56] process uh you've actually outlined what
[00:03:58] your current study habit and this is
[00:04:00] really useful and so what I'm going to
[00:04:01] do now is I'm actually going to map out
[00:04:03] what your study process is and I'm going
[00:04:05] to point out the areas where I think
[00:04:08] will be probably the most highed areas
[00:04:10] for you to focus on based on my
[00:04:12] experience having not only overcome this
[00:04:14] challenge myself but in teaching
[00:04:17] thousands of other people in almost
[00:04:19] exactly the same situation to overcome
[00:04:21] this and it does take some time but if
[00:04:23] you focus on on these things I'm
[00:04:25] confident that you will be able to make
[00:04:27] it through so the first thing that
[00:04:30] you've said here is that you
[00:04:33] are uh doing a pre-lecture review before
[00:04:37] class so we're going to put the lecture
[00:04:40] in the middle as your main learning
[00:04:43] event and then before this we have a
[00:04:46] pre-study that you're
[00:04:49] doing um
[00:04:51] and you are doing this uh it doesn't say
[00:04:55] what you're doing it just says
[00:04:57] study and then after the lecture about
[00:04:59] 30 minutes to 1 hour after your lecture
[00:05:04] you are going to review the content
[00:05:07] again so this is your first review uh I
[00:05:09] try to receive previous days content and
[00:05:11] then tack on whatever else I need to so
[00:05:14] I'm also doing space repetition I also
[00:05:17] try to teach the concepts to my family
[00:05:19] to apply active recall I also asked chat
[00:05:22] B to make mock tests based on my notes
[00:05:24] and the course content similar to what
[00:05:26] I'd see on a test so
[00:05:30] there isn't really a chronology that's
[00:05:31] really clear here in terms of when
[00:05:34] that's happening um I sort of doubt
[00:05:36] you're doing that all on the exact same
[00:05:38] day as you're doing your lecture review
[00:05:41] um so at some point after this first
[00:05:44] review let's at some point after we're
[00:05:47] doing other
[00:05:49] reviews
[00:05:51] uh and these are composed of teaching to
[00:05:57] family and doing mock tests
[00:06:00] using chat
[00:06:02] BT um and just trying to accumulate your
[00:06:07] previous uh content during your study
[00:06:09] session so that you can try to do some
[00:06:10] space repetition so overall I'm going to
[00:06:15] say that you have an a template that is
[00:06:20] can be very
[00:06:21] successful but there are a few things
[00:06:24] that immediately stick out to me as high
[00:06:27] yield areas where I think that there
[00:06:29] could be changes that are made first of
[00:06:32] all the idea of teaching and doing mock
[00:06:36] tests and also cumulating to try to get
[00:06:38] that space repetition these are all
[00:06:39] great strategies to use I would
[00:06:41] encourage you to keep doing that um I'm
[00:06:43] always talking about it's not enough to
[00:06:45] just use a technique you also need to
[00:06:46] know why a technique works so I'll just
[00:06:48] briefly explain that the teaching is
[00:06:51] really good because it's activating a
[00:06:53] generation effect in that it's forcing
[00:06:56] your brain to generate new knowledge
[00:06:58] based on the knowledge that you have it
[00:07:00] is also a
[00:07:03] multi-order technique multi-order
[00:07:06] meaning that it's testing at different
[00:07:07] levels of knowledge so you're testing in
[00:07:10] like the small facts and the details but
[00:07:12] it also forces you to think about how
[00:07:15] you're going to package and organize the
[00:07:16] material when you're teaching it to
[00:07:18] someone um and that organization process
[00:07:21] requires you to evaluate and think about
[00:07:24] the material in relation to itself it
[00:07:27] creates a network and so that's a higher
[00:07:29] r um strategy so teaching is for that
[00:07:32] reason usually a very good one uh the
[00:07:34] mock testing this is great because again
[00:07:36] it it tends to be multi-order especially
[00:07:38] if chat GPT is generating it it's
[00:07:40] usually pretty good at generating these
[00:07:41] like multi-order questions um and also
[00:07:44] this is a a great way of doing your
[00:07:47] active recall as is the
[00:07:49] teaching um and it's also going to help
[00:07:52] you to do more targeted Gap finding as
[00:07:57] opposed to teaching where you might have
[00:07:58] to sort of teach the entire topic for
[00:08:01] you know 15 20 minutes before you
[00:08:03] realize oh here's a gap in my knowledge
[00:08:04] with testing it's it allows you to do
[00:08:06] that a little bit more quickly and in a
[00:08:07] more targeted way so this is all very
[00:08:10] good um having revision and retrieval
[00:08:13] strategies that incorporate all of these
[00:08:15] different elements is a good strategy to
[00:08:18] be
[00:08:19] using here are the things that I see
[00:08:21] that I think you should focus on the the
[00:08:25] first part that really sticks out to me
[00:08:28] is this area
[00:08:31] here specifically the lack of
[00:08:33] information in this part in the
[00:08:36] pre-study you've sort of just said a
[00:08:39] pre-lecture
[00:08:40] review uh and in the lecture itself
[00:08:43] there is no information and even when
[00:08:46] you're reviewing it afterwards there's
[00:08:48] no real information about what you're
[00:08:50] actually doing so again if we're going
[00:08:53] back to that equation of successor
[00:08:54] effort times
[00:08:56] process either you have not told me much
[00:09:00] about your process or you're not very
[00:09:03] aware of the process you're using and I
[00:09:05] think probably given the amount of
[00:09:06] detail you've given the other things
[00:09:08] it's probably that you're not aware of
[00:09:10] the process as deeply as you should be
[00:09:13] if I think about pre-study or or just
[00:09:16] any type of study imagine someone who's
[00:09:19] sitting
[00:09:20] there um who's uh you know listening to
[00:09:23] a
[00:09:24] lecture while they're vacuuming their
[00:09:27] house and then uh
[00:09:30] at the same time having a conversation
[00:09:31] with their flatmate and with their
[00:09:33] favorite music on in the background
[00:09:36] imagine that versus someone who's
[00:09:38] sitting there at their desk focused with
[00:09:42] their books out with their lectures
[00:09:44] material out you know writing their
[00:09:45] notes and then imagine that compared to
[00:09:48] someone who is looking through their
[00:09:50] lecture material specifically looking
[00:09:52] for the areas that they think are the
[00:09:54] most important um thinking about how the
[00:09:57] most important things are related to
[00:09:59] each other building a general
[00:10:01] understanding of the topic and
[00:10:02] strategically going and searching for
[00:10:05] specific terminology and keywords that
[00:10:07] they think they're going to struggle
[00:10:08] with during the lecture and
[00:10:11] consolidating those points when you
[00:10:13] think about those different types of
[00:10:14] activities what becomes very clear is
[00:10:16] that what you're doing in the time makes
[00:10:18] a very big difference to how good your
[00:10:21] memory is going to be at the end of it
[00:10:23] and how effective that process was so
[00:10:25] the fact that you are doing pre-study is
[00:10:28] actually really really good this is
[00:10:30] something that a lot of people don't do
[00:10:32] at all so if you're going from not doing
[00:10:34] any pre-study to just doing some form of
[00:10:36] pre-study there's a immediate benefit
[00:10:38] that you can reap from just doing that
[00:10:41] but from the point of doing it to doing
[00:10:44] it well there's a big spectrum and so I
[00:10:47] suspect that just based on the fact that
[00:10:50] you haven't given any more detail it's
[00:10:51] an area that you probably haven't
[00:10:53] thought about as much as you should and
[00:10:56] ideally anytime you create a learning
[00:10:58] system you want it to build on itself I
[00:11:01] often say think about learning like
[00:11:02] creating a
[00:11:04] sculpture uh you start with a big just
[00:11:06] rough cut block of wood and then in your
[00:11:09] first pass of wood you're not creating
[00:11:11] like a a perfect you know statue you're
[00:11:15] just creating a general outline you're
[00:11:17] just chipping away these Big Blocks
[00:11:20] until you get a rough kind of shape that
[00:11:23] you know you're kind of happy to work
[00:11:24] with and then after you do that you go
[00:11:27] back on it and then you start adding a
[00:11:29] little bit more detail to it and so the
[00:11:33] the sculpture kind of
[00:11:36] develops in these kind of passes with
[00:11:38] each pass getting more and more and more
[00:11:40] detailed and more and more refined but
[00:11:42] the key here is that as you keep
[00:11:45] building you're working with the same
[00:11:47] slab of stone you're not like chipping
[00:11:51] away at one stone one day and then the
[00:11:53] next day just getting like a whole new
[00:11:54] slab of stone and then just working on
[00:11:56] that and then the next day now you're
[00:11:57] like doing some pottery and then the
[00:11:59] next day you're like you painting on a
[00:12:01] canvas you're working on the same thing
[00:12:04] and so all the time you spend on it is
[00:12:07] continuing to refine this product
[00:12:09] further and further and further and
[00:12:10] that's the key whenever we are doing any
[00:12:13] study we want in our pre-study to get
[00:12:16] the basic shape and the basic outline of
[00:12:19] what we're looking at and however you do
[00:12:22] that the product of the pre-study we
[00:12:26] want that to feed directly into so let's
[00:12:30] say for example because I I often teach
[00:12:32] this a technique that we're going to
[00:12:33] create a basic mind map okay of of the
[00:12:36] of the main ideas very very simple and
[00:12:38] you can do this in 15 to 20 minutes just
[00:12:41] going through picking up the main ideas
[00:12:43] thinking about how they connected
[00:12:44] together try to make it make sense for
[00:12:46] you at a big picture level without
[00:12:48] focusing on too much of the details when
[00:12:51] you do that you take that into the
[00:12:54] lecture and that becomes the current
[00:12:56] level that you're building off of so
[00:12:58] again in the lecture your objective is
[00:13:01] not to get to 100% that's not realistic
[00:13:05] at least not for most people the next
[00:13:08] step is to get a little bit more detail
[00:13:10] on there carve out that shape with a
[00:13:12] little bit more Fidelity and so that map
[00:13:14] that you brought in starts becoming a
[00:13:17] little bit more fleshed out right we add
[00:13:19] a few more subconcepts we add a little
[00:13:21] bit more detail we you know realize that
[00:13:24] this connection is actually wrong and
[00:13:25] actually maybe it should be like this
[00:13:27] instead um you know and this this map it
[00:13:30] it grows quite organically and probably
[00:13:33] by the end of the lecture you've got
[00:13:35] lots of ideas and it's it's looking
[00:13:36] rather messy which means that now you've
[00:13:39] got a great setup for your post lecture
[00:13:42] first review because from your review
[00:13:45] You've got lots of things to clean up
[00:13:47] and you've got lots of little other
[00:13:48] ideas that you didn't know how to add to
[00:13:50] your current map to your current
[00:13:52] sculpure that you can now spend some
[00:13:55] time to add on to and so during this
[00:13:58] review period we're cleaning it up we're
[00:14:01] adding more detail we're spending time
[00:14:03] going through the textbook we're taking
[00:14:05] our time to understand some things that
[00:14:06] we didn't understand before we're
[00:14:08] correcting some relationships that we
[00:14:09] got wrong before you know we're we're
[00:14:12] giving us the space to correct ourselves
[00:14:15] to evaluate what we've got and to add on
[00:14:17] more information and when we do it in
[00:14:19] this way there's two main things that
[00:14:21] this achieves number one is that when we
[00:14:24] do this it automatically is more time
[00:14:26] efficient because the time we're
[00:14:28] spending on building knowledge Builds on
[00:14:30] itself we're starting at level one and
[00:14:33] then we're taking it to level two and
[00:14:34] then we're taking it to level three as
[00:14:36] opposed to studying and reviewing
[00:14:39] content in one way and then in the
[00:14:40] lecture thinking about it in a totally
[00:14:42] different way and then afterwards
[00:14:43] reviewing it in a different way and then
[00:14:45] testing ourselves in a different way
[00:14:46] constantly We're Never Letting our
[00:14:48] knowledge really build up at least not
[00:14:50] systematically and that's usually the
[00:14:52] reason why uh a lot of people will feel
[00:14:55] like they only really get the topic and
[00:14:57] it only really clicks to them like just
[00:14:59] before the exam when they've done heaps
[00:15:01] of this uh reviewing like testing and
[00:15:04] testing and testing because that's the
[00:15:06] thing that builds on itself and because
[00:15:08] you've tested yourself so many times
[00:15:10] you've allowed the knowledge to actually
[00:15:11] build for the first time and it makes
[00:15:14] you wonder like well what's the point of
[00:15:15] even going to the lectures why not just
[00:15:16] Spam through practice questions and for
[00:15:19] a lot of people you could just do that
[00:15:21] it's just as effective as your other
[00:15:22] method of studying and all the notes
[00:15:24] that you write and everything that you
[00:15:25] did did beforehand kind of becomes a
[00:15:27] waste of time and that's actually true
[00:15:29] it is a waste of time if you're not
[00:15:31] making it build on itself whereas if you
[00:15:34] do this not only is it building but
[00:15:36] because we're thinking in networks which
[00:15:38] is the way that our brain likes to
[00:15:40] operate it automatically also improves
[00:15:43] our
[00:15:44] memory and it increases the depth of our
[00:15:46] knowledge which means that at the end of
[00:15:48] all of the studying we actually just
[00:15:50] naturally retain more so not only does
[00:15:53] it mean that obviously our memory is
[00:15:55] better but we're even wasting less time
[00:15:58] later
[00:16:00] on relearning the stuff that we forgot
[00:16:02] and just imagine if 80 to 90% of what
[00:16:05] you learned the first time you learn it
[00:16:08] you just remembered that for like 3 4
[00:16:10] weeks imagine how much time you would
[00:16:11] save from not having to just relearn the
[00:16:13] stuff you forgot 3 4 days ago and that
[00:16:16] 80 to 90% retention these are real
[00:16:18] numbers like the real students filling
[00:16:20] in the surveys on my program they are
[00:16:22] saying that their retention after just
[00:16:24] you know one two weeks studying at one
[00:16:26] time is 80 90 95 % and it's possible and
[00:16:31] your brain is capable of doing that but
[00:16:33] only if you put it in a position where
[00:16:36] it can do that and that's all about
[00:16:39] thinking in these relationships and
[00:16:41] building that big picture understanding
[00:16:42] and working in this way where it's just
[00:16:45] sequentially getting more and more
[00:16:47] detailed which stops your brain from
[00:16:48] getting overwhelmed because as soon as
[00:16:50] your brain gets just too overwhelmed
[00:16:52] things are going to start slipping but
[00:16:54] by building on it in this way we reduce
[00:16:56] that overwhelm and it allows your brain
[00:16:58] to hold on that information much more
[00:17:00] solidly so overall Mr independent pickle
[00:17:04] I think the area probably that if you
[00:17:07] were to spend some time to get better at
[00:17:10] that I am like very very confident that
[00:17:13] this would help you is number one
[00:17:16] creating a system where what you do in
[00:17:18] your pre-study is building into your
[00:17:20] lecture and then it's building into your
[00:17:22] post review and then number two making
[00:17:25] sure that when you're thinking about the
[00:17:27] information from the very beginning but
[00:17:29] all the way through you're trying to
[00:17:31] think about it in networks in a big
[00:17:33] picture sense connecting ideas together
[00:17:36] rather than focusing on things in
[00:17:37] isolation and if you do that on top of
[00:17:40] what you're already doing with your
[00:17:41] teaching and your mock tests and
[00:17:44] cumulating stuff and reviewing it to do
[00:17:45] the space repetition I think you'll find
[00:17:47] that it's much easier to cover that
[00:17:49] volume and that your your retention and
[00:17:52] your depth of understanding just becomes
[00:17:54] much deeper and more intuitive and if
[00:17:55] right now you're getting mid 60s with a
[00:17:58] method that you're currently using just
[00:18:00] making this change should be enough to
[00:18:03] get you into the 80s so hopefully that
[00:18:04] helped if there's a question that you
[00:18:05] want me to answer then leave a question
[00:18:08] in the comments below and if you want to
[00:18:10] learn a little bit more about other
[00:18:11] techniques that you can apply or how you
[00:18:13] can do your pre-study better or what to
[00:18:14] do during the lectures or how to make
[00:18:16] learning build on itself in a complete

=== 13 Years of No BS Study Advice in 58 Minutes ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrPE3Zmq0mk

[00:00:00] I've been a learning coach for the past
[00:00:01] 13 years I run a learning program called
[00:00:04] I can study where I've worked with tens
[00:00:06] of thousands of Learners around the
[00:00:08] world to help them Reach their dream
[00:00:10] results and I'm going to compress 13
[00:00:13] years of studying and learning advice
[00:00:16] into this one video number one studying
[00:00:19] does not equal learning you can spend a
[00:00:23] lot of time studying and get very little
[00:00:27] learning out of it studying is just the
[00:00:30] thing that you do it's the way you write
[00:00:32] your notes it's the way you read your
[00:00:33] book the way you test yourself they're
[00:00:35] the physical activities we study so that
[00:00:39] it can produce learning learning is the
[00:00:41] outcome it's the thing that happens in
[00:00:44] our brain that connects the dots
[00:00:46] together that turns information into
[00:00:49] Knowledge Learning has only occurred if
[00:00:52] the information is something that you
[00:00:53] can remember and you understand it
[00:00:56] deeply and then you can apply it in the
[00:00:58] way that you need to apply it so if you
[00:01:00] spent four 5 6 7 8 9 10 hours studying
[00:01:04] but you don't have good retention depth
[00:01:07] of understanding and the ability to
[00:01:08] apply that knowledge after spending that
[00:01:10] time you didn't learn you only studied
[00:01:14] and it's this understanding that I wish
[00:01:17] I had 13 years ago when I was
[00:01:20] desperately trying to enter into medical
[00:01:22] school and I was studying 20 hours a day
[00:01:24] sacrificing sleep sacrificing friends
[00:01:26] sacrificing Hobbies relationships with
[00:01:28] everyone around me um taking a massive
[00:01:30] hit to my mental health because I was so
[00:01:32] sleep deprived just studying so much
[00:01:36] that I wish I realize that different
[00:01:40] methods of studying set on a spectrum of
[00:01:43] Effectiveness some methods produce
[00:01:46] almost no real learning like rereading
[00:01:49] and just like highlighting things this
[00:01:52] produces like no real learning the
[00:01:53] amount of time you need to spend on that
[00:01:56] activity and how in a way lucky you have
[00:01:58] to be for that to just accidentally
[00:02:00] create learning is
[00:02:02] astronomical on the other hand there are
[00:02:04] other techniques that produce much more
[00:02:06] learning and the idea is that we want to
[00:02:09] get rid of the stuff that doesn't work
[00:02:11] and replace it with techniques that
[00:02:13] produce a high amount of learning and
[00:02:15] thinking about studying not as just like
[00:02:18] the thing that you do and then if you
[00:02:19] have problems it's like oh I've got
[00:02:21] problems with my studying very
[00:02:24] abstractly and thinking about it instead
[00:02:26] as okay I'm doing stuff but how much
[00:02:29] learning
[00:02:30] uh each of the methods I'm using
[00:02:33] producing this shifts the focus it makes
[00:02:35] you much more targeted in being able to
[00:02:37] improve the way you learn number two
[00:02:40] stop looking for study hacks real ones
[00:02:44] don't exist if you go on Tik Tok or
[00:02:47] Instagram and you search like # study
[00:02:49] study and studygram study talk you will
[00:02:52] find hundreds of videos of people saying
[00:02:56] use this technique and you're going to
[00:02:58] get 100% on your next test
[00:03:00] like guaranteed and it promises you a
[00:03:04] lot in like a 30second one minute video
[00:03:08] and these videos get like millions of
[00:03:10] views because there are millions of
[00:03:11] people looking for this shortcut to
[00:03:15] learning here's the truth if you've
[00:03:17] really been struggling to get better at
[00:03:19] learning then the solution is not going
[00:03:22] to come from a 30second study hack if it
[00:03:25] was that easy to solve you would have
[00:03:28] already solved it and most of the time
[00:03:31] yes sometimes there are little things
[00:03:33] that can be adjusted and like tiny
[00:03:36] little tweaks that you can make to the
[00:03:38] way that you study to make it more
[00:03:39] effective but most of the time the big
[00:03:42] problems that people have with studying
[00:03:44] that holds them back from success are
[00:03:47] rooted in years and years of habits that
[00:03:51] have just stacked together and you can't
[00:03:54] unlearn and retrain that overnight and
[00:03:56] so when you focus on study hacks not
[00:03:58] only is it just not going to work and
[00:04:00] you're going to waste your time but the
[00:04:01] part that really bugs me is when I sit
[00:04:03] down with a student and they've been
[00:04:04] using so many study hacks for so long
[00:04:08] and they haven't found good results with
[00:04:10] them they start believing that they're
[00:04:13] just not going to be smart enough I
[00:04:15] remember I had this one student who uh
[00:04:18] like a really bright bubbly girl um
[00:04:21] trying to enter into medical school at
[00:04:22] the time she came into my office we had
[00:04:24] a consultation together and I mapped out
[00:04:26] her whole learning process and I looked
[00:04:28] at her and I said okay well based on
[00:04:30] what you're doing it seems like you've
[00:04:32] got these habits that are leading to you
[00:04:34] doing this kind of studying and thinking
[00:04:36] in this way which means that you're
[00:04:37] probably going to struggle with these
[00:04:38] sorts of things and I kind of created a
[00:04:40] road map for her uh in terms of how she
[00:04:43] needs to improve and I was explaining
[00:04:45] this stuff and then I looked up at her
[00:04:47] and then I can see that she's she just
[00:04:48] starts crying and I thought I'd done
[00:04:50] something wrong I was like damn was not
[00:04:52] prepared for this I asked her what's
[00:04:54] going on and she said I just thought I
[00:04:56] was Dumb and so she had been using study
[00:05:02] hacks and tips for so long that she
[00:05:05] believed in herself that since all these
[00:05:08] hacks that are promising her great
[00:05:10] results are not working therefore the
[00:05:12] only logical conclusion left must be
[00:05:17] she's just too dumb and I think that's a
[00:05:20] very sad conclusion to make just because
[00:05:23] you didn't realize the answer doesn't
[00:05:26] lie in a shortcut so then the natural
[00:05:27] question might be what of my meant to
[00:05:30] look at instead so you might look at
[00:05:33] what successful students are already
[00:05:35] doing to try to copy them which leads me
[00:05:37] to number three stop copying successful
[00:05:43] students and I know this sounds very
[00:05:46] counterintuitive if you see someone
[00:05:47] that's successful and you want to be
[00:05:49] successful naturally you think if I just
[00:05:50] do what they're doing I'm going to be
[00:05:52] just as successful here's the thing
[00:05:55] learning is a very personalized thing
[00:05:59] it's a very very personalized process
[00:06:01] and what works for one person isn't
[00:06:03] necessarily going to work for another
[00:06:04] person and this is especially true in
[00:06:06] learning to learn because of something
[00:06:08] called Deep
[00:06:10] processing deep processing is your
[00:06:13] ability like and a lot of this is
[00:06:15] determined genetically and early
[00:06:17] childhood experiences and you can train
[00:06:19] it and this is what I do you know what
[00:06:21] we do at I can study we train it uh but
[00:06:23] it does take time but de processing is
[00:06:25] your brain's ability to connect
[00:06:28] information together and extract
[00:06:30] meaningful learning out of the
[00:06:32] information that you're consuming when
[00:06:34] you look at someone you say man they're
[00:06:36] just like a genius you they just read it
[00:06:37] and just they just get it everything
[00:06:39] clicks for them what their brain is
[00:06:41] doing to make it click for them that is
[00:06:44] the processing and it and again it's
[00:06:47] something that can be trained and the
[00:06:48] reason this is important for copying
[00:06:51] successful students is because most
[00:06:53] successful students are not successful
[00:06:56] because of the techniques they use it's
[00:06:59] not because of how they're
[00:07:01] studying it's because they have a level
[00:07:03] of deep processing that is in a way
[00:07:06] natural like they're they were luckier
[00:07:08] in a way um and they could get away with
[00:07:11] using mediocre techniques and still make
[00:07:13] it work for them a great analogy is
[00:07:15] thinking about how a Car Works you've
[00:07:18] got an engine and if you have a really
[00:07:21] powerful engine and you just floor it
[00:07:24] like you don't have to be a great driver
[00:07:26] you're going to go really fast and sure
[00:07:28] maybe if you're competing against other
[00:07:30] people with like awesome cars then you
[00:07:32] need to have that skill but just in the
[00:07:34] general population most people are not
[00:07:36] driving supercars and so if you just
[00:07:38] just even slightly just push down on the
[00:07:40] PED you're going to go fast so if
[00:07:43] someone else is in a different car
[00:07:46] that's not as fast with a smaller engine
[00:07:49] looking at the person driving and trying
[00:07:50] to copy their technique Shifting the
[00:07:53] same way pushing down on the accelerator
[00:07:55] the same everything like the technique
[00:07:57] everything is exactly the same they're
[00:07:58] not going to go as fast and this is a
[00:08:00] very easy thing is that when you look at
[00:08:02] what successful students are doing and
[00:08:04] I'm not talking about like study
[00:08:06] influencers who honestly a lot of the
[00:08:08] time when they talk about the stuff that
[00:08:10] they're doing they're not doing that
[00:08:12] stuff they're just making up stuff that
[00:08:14] they're saying they're doing to create
[00:08:16] some content for it but it's like when
[00:08:18] you look at what they actually do in
[00:08:19] their daily life they're not doing half
[00:08:21] that stuff if you look at what
[00:08:23] successful students are actually doing
[00:08:25] and you just do exactly the same thing
[00:08:27] and millions of people do the same exact
[00:08:29] thing those millions of people are not
[00:08:31] all getting that top result and a lot of
[00:08:35] that comes down to the Deep proccessing
[00:08:37] ability so what you should be doing
[00:08:39] instead of just copying successful
[00:08:41] students is figuring out how you can be
[00:08:44] successful yourself and like I said it's
[00:08:46] personalized and it doesn't mean that if
[00:08:48] you don't have good deep processing that
[00:08:50] you're never going to be successful my
[00:08:52] deep processing is not actually like
[00:08:55] naturally amazing I remember 13 14 15
[00:08:59] years ago especially when I was going
[00:09:01] through high
[00:09:02] school I would look at these people in
[00:09:04] my class that don't seem to need to
[00:09:07] study like at all and somehow they're
[00:09:11] doing so much better than I was and I
[00:09:13] was actively trying to do better than
[00:09:15] them and studying more than them and
[00:09:17] that continued when I was trying to get
[00:09:18] through medical school it continued into
[00:09:20] medical school where there were these
[00:09:21] people that were just like anomalies and
[00:09:23] now a lot of people look at me and think
[00:09:25] of me as an anomaly like when I did my
[00:09:28] master of education I got the the
[00:09:30] highest grade in the entire year and I
[00:09:32] studied like for six weeks like even
[00:09:35] less than that and people would look at
[00:09:38] that and say okay it must be because
[00:09:40] like I'm built different but it's not I
[00:09:43] I really actively try to build myself
[00:09:46] and my deep processing ability to get
[00:09:49] there and if that's you then you really
[00:09:52] do need to like it's if your deep
[00:09:54] personing is not at a certain level it
[00:09:56] is very difficult to be a good learner
[00:09:59] and so training that becomes a very high
[00:10:02] priority and that is not something that
[00:10:05] already successful students a lot of
[00:10:08] them are not doing that number four stop
[00:10:11] thinking techniques start thinking
[00:10:14] systems I'll tell you a
[00:10:16] story there's a student that I uh was
[00:10:20] working with a couple years ago and they
[00:10:23] were really really struggling with their
[00:10:25] studying for a long time and and this is
[00:10:27] not just like working with me for a
[00:10:28] short amount of time like they were
[00:10:29] working with me for uh like an entire
[00:10:33] year so I talked to them and asked them
[00:10:34] what was going on and I kind of mapped
[00:10:36] everything out and what I realized is
[00:10:38] that he had this belief that there is
[00:10:42] this best technique and that the perfect
[00:10:46] technique is the end goal once you
[00:10:49] understand and can use this perfect
[00:10:51] technique you don't need the other
[00:10:52] techniques anymore it's just you can use
[00:10:54] that and your problems are all
[00:10:56] solved that is not realistic
[00:11:01] there is no such thing as the perfect
[00:11:05] technique you have to start thinking
[00:11:06] about techniques like tools you cannot
[00:11:09] build an entire house with a screwdriver
[00:11:12] it doesn't matter how good your
[00:11:13] screwdriver is you just can't do it or
[00:11:15] if you do it like your hands are
[00:11:17] bleeding and it took you like 30
[00:11:19] years the idea is that you have to have
[00:11:22] a tool box of different tools that you
[00:11:25] know how to use and each tool has its
[00:11:26] own purpose and its own limitations and
[00:11:29] exact same thing is true for learning
[00:11:30] skills each technique or method or
[00:11:33] strategy has a specific purpose that
[00:11:35] it's really good for and then it has
[00:11:36] limitations and just because something
[00:11:38] has limitations doesn't mean you should
[00:11:41] do what the student was doing and
[00:11:43] abandon it and say oh I must not be good
[00:11:46] enough I'm not going to learn that use
[00:11:48] it for what it's good for and then
[00:11:50] supplement that with other techniques
[00:11:53] that fill in those gaps there's another
[00:11:55] side to the Spectrum here which is that
[00:11:57] some students also never think about the
[00:11:59] limitations in the first place and so
[00:12:02] they'll have a technique and they'll
[00:12:03] believe this technique is like Flawless
[00:12:07] and so they will then use and abuse it
[00:12:10] to do everything and the best example of
[00:12:13] this is flash cards a lot of people look
[00:12:15] at flash card space uh space repetition
[00:12:16] and active recall and that is like their
[00:12:19] whole method of studying like they just
[00:12:21] have flash cards and if they if it's not
[00:12:23] enough it's not working then they think
[00:12:26] hm what's the problem ah here's the
[00:12:28] answer
[00:12:29] more flash cards and that's a situation
[00:12:32] where you're abusing it flash cards are
[00:12:34] a great technique for a specific purpose
[00:12:39] but if you use it for something it's not
[00:12:41] good for you're not going to get good
[00:12:43] results you're wasting time you're
[00:12:44] burning efficiency now as we have
[00:12:47] established if you want to become a
[00:12:48] better and more productive learner you
[00:12:50] need to upgrade your entire Learning
[00:12:52] System and when I say this a lot of
[00:12:54] students will come up to me and say well
[00:12:56] Justin I don't even have a learning
[00:12:59] system however that is not true most
[00:13:03] students have a learning system it's
[00:13:06] just not refined and so it's like most
[00:13:09] students have a toolbox of sorts to
[00:13:11] begin with it's just that it may not be
[00:13:14] full of like premium top-of-the-line
[00:13:16] tools that they need to excel at the top
[00:13:18] level now a high leverage activity that
[00:13:21] you should do is to have your toolbox
[00:13:24] assessed by an expert this helps you to
[00:13:26] figure out which of your tools is the
[00:13:28] weakest but more importantly where you
[00:13:31] should invest your time in first to get
[00:13:33] the biggest improvements in your results
[00:13:36] now this is something that I do all the
[00:13:38] time and if I could see you in person
[00:13:40] then I could give you a consultation map
[00:13:42] out your learning toolbox tell you where
[00:13:44] you need to work on and just do that for
[00:13:46] you on the spot but I only have so much
[00:13:48] time and it would also be kind of weird
[00:13:51] for me to just rock up to your house
[00:13:53] unannounced just like offer you a
[00:13:56] learning toolbox evaluation but to still
[00:13:59] help you I've actually created a free
[00:14:02] learning toolbox assessment for you it's
[00:14:05] a quiz that evaluates your entire
[00:14:06] learning system and then even gives you
[00:14:08] a score out of 100 more importantly it
[00:14:10] also gives you a personalized report at
[00:14:12] the end which tells you exactly which
[00:14:14] parts of your learning system are
[00:14:15] holding you back and therefore what you
[00:14:17] should work on it's absolutely free and
[00:14:19] I'll leave a link in the description for
[00:14:21] you below now let's move on back to our
[00:14:24] next study lesson number five avoid the
[00:14:28] illusion
[00:14:29] of learning what is the illusion of
[00:14:31] learning the illusion of learning is
[00:14:33] when you do something that makes you
[00:14:36] feel like you learning but you're not
[00:14:40] and this is basically the learning
[00:14:42] equivalent of productive procrastination
[00:14:45] so one of the things we're probably all
[00:14:46] guilty of is you know when there's
[00:14:48] something that you need to do like a big
[00:14:50] task and you procrastinate but you
[00:14:52] procrastinate doing things that feel
[00:14:54] productive like organizing your room or
[00:14:56] like cleaning up your desk or something
[00:14:58] like that or you know just planning like
[00:15:00] creating a schedule and it's not the
[00:15:03] most important thing for you to do
[00:15:04] really what you need to do is just get
[00:15:06] on and do the task but we procrastinate
[00:15:08] with these other things that feel like
[00:15:09] we're making progress and we do that
[00:15:11] because it feels it's easy and it makes
[00:15:14] us feel better about the fact that we're
[00:15:17] making progress and so that's basically
[00:15:19] what the illusion of learning is it's
[00:15:23] when you're doing something and it makes
[00:15:24] you feel good because it's like I guess
[00:15:28] this is helping me was learning but when
[00:15:30] you actually go to measure it it's
[00:15:33] probably not helping and there's two
[00:15:35] really common examples I see in students
[00:15:37] that I work with the first one is in
[00:15:40] just writing and rewriting notes the
[00:15:43] amount of times that I've spoken to
[00:15:45] someone mapped out their learning and
[00:15:47] then they have a 1H hour lecture
[00:15:49] followed by two three hours of writing
[00:15:52] notes but then at the end of those 2
[00:15:55] three
[00:15:56] hours they haven't learned anything I
[00:15:58] say well if you were s a test right now
[00:16:00] how well do you think You' do they say
[00:16:01] well terribly because like I haven't
[00:16:04] learned it yet I've just written my
[00:16:05] notes why did you spend 3 hours writing
[00:16:11] notes and doing stuff if it's not
[00:16:13] helping you with learning and a lot of
[00:16:15] the time the answer is that it's just
[00:16:16] what they're used to doing it's
[00:16:18] comfortable it's an existing habit and
[00:16:20] they don't know what else to do they
[00:16:21] don't know how to really create
[00:16:24] effective learning so they hide in the
[00:16:28] comfort of the the illusion just saying
[00:16:31] I'm sure if I just do this it will help
[00:16:34] with my learning somehow even though you
[00:16:37] know when you really look at it that
[00:16:40] it's not helping with your memory and
[00:16:41] your retention and your depth of
[00:16:43] understanding your ability to apply it
[00:16:44] and so if you're trapped in the illusion
[00:16:45] of learning the answer is not just like
[00:16:48] feel terrible and and panic and stay in
[00:16:50] the illusion of learning it's to accept
[00:16:53] that you're doing something that's
[00:16:54] frankly kind of useless and learn about
[00:16:57] the Alternatives the there are other
[00:17:00] things that you can do and not knowing
[00:17:03] what to do is not a good excuse and I
[00:17:06] don't mean to call you out and I don't
[00:17:09] mean to upset you with saying that but I
[00:17:13] think if you really want to give
[00:17:14] yourself the best chance of success
[00:17:16] sometimes you do have to look at things
[00:17:18] as like this is the cold hard truth now
[00:17:21] one of the things that you can do to
[00:17:23] break out of the illusion of learning
[00:17:24] and do something that's a little bit
[00:17:25] more effective is number six
[00:17:29] yourself earlier and more often I
[00:17:32] remember for most of my life especially
[00:17:34] High School I would study and study for
[00:17:37] an exam and then by the time I'm
[00:17:38] entering into the exam I really don't
[00:17:41] know how well I'm going to do like
[00:17:43] usually I would know that I'm going to
[00:17:45] pass and I'm probably not going to do
[00:17:47] like too badly but I have to wait for
[00:17:49] the result to find out and that sounds
[00:17:51] completely natural but
[00:17:55] actually there isn't a good reason not
[00:17:58] to know how well you're going to do in
[00:18:00] an exam before you walk in and if you
[00:18:03] don't that probably means you're not
[00:18:05] testing yourself early enough and often
[00:18:07] enough how I used to study and this is
[00:18:08] how a lot of people study is that you
[00:18:10] just spend time like studying and
[00:18:12] reading and writing notes and then like
[00:18:14] a week or two before the exam I'm doing
[00:18:17] practice tests or or sometimes it's like
[00:18:18] the night before the exam I'm just doing
[00:18:20] like practice papers and I'm finding
[00:18:22] these gaps and I'm getting used to
[00:18:24] applying my knowledge and I'm going into
[00:18:26] the exam and here's the thing is that
[00:18:28] let's say you test yourself and then you
[00:18:31] you find all these
[00:18:33] gaps you don't really have time to fill
[00:18:38] any of them anymore and in fact I've
[00:18:40] even worked with students that
[00:18:42] deliberately avoid testing themselves
[00:18:45] with harder questions because they know
[00:18:47] they won't be able to answer it it's
[00:18:49] like you're still going to have to
[00:18:51] answer it in the exam anyway the point
[00:18:53] is you have to find these gaps by
[00:18:56] testing yourself as early as possible
[00:18:58] possible and one of the changes that I
[00:19:00] made that really helped with my exam
[00:19:03] results and my exam confidence is just
[00:19:06] testing myself at the end of every week
[00:19:08] at the end of every month so on the
[00:19:11] Saturday I would test myself on
[00:19:12] everything I learned from Monday to
[00:19:13] Friday and then on at the on the
[00:19:16] Saturday of every month I would test
[00:19:18] myself on everything I learned during
[00:19:20] that month which meant that number one I
[00:19:22] was Finding gaps early but the number of
[00:19:24] gaps I was Finding was not that large
[00:19:26] cuz I was only having like a few days
[00:19:28] worth of learning to to review so it
[00:19:30] didn't take that long to fill those gaps
[00:19:33] and then by the end of the month I had
[00:19:36] already filled a lot of those gaps and
[00:19:37] so by the time I would enter into an
[00:19:39] exam I would generally know where I'm at
[00:19:43] like if I didn't have enough time to
[00:19:44] study or I knew that I didn't really
[00:19:46] quite understand a certain thing I knew
[00:19:47] I'm probably going to lose a couple
[00:19:48] marks on that so I could guess how my
[00:19:52] exam result was going to be fairly
[00:19:54] accurately but if you're going into an
[00:19:55] exam either not knowing or feeling
[00:19:57] confident and the result is ve like very
[00:19:59] different from what you expected then
[00:20:02] you're either not testing yourself early
[00:20:03] enough and often enough or you're
[00:20:06] testing yourself in the wrong way and so
[00:20:08] what is the right way to test yourself
[00:20:09] number seven test at each level of
[00:20:13] knowledge I talk about this concept of
[00:20:15] um levels of knowledge very often in a
[00:20:17] lot of my other videos like blooms
[00:20:19] revised taxonomy I'm not going to go
[00:20:21] into it in a lot of depth right now but
[00:20:23] basically knowledge can be divided into
[00:20:24] different levels at the low levels it's
[00:20:26] just memorization regurg ation just
[00:20:29] being able to explain something it's
[00:20:31] very very isolated at the higher levels
[00:20:33] you can use Concepts together you can
[00:20:35] see how they connect and influence each
[00:20:37] each other so it means that when you get
[00:20:39] a tricky question you can look at that
[00:20:42] question and you can dissect it you can
[00:20:43] pull apart which concepts are relevant
[00:20:46] how you need to connect them together to
[00:20:47] arrive at an answer and so one of the
[00:20:49] mistakes that I used to make is I was
[00:20:52] predominantly testing myself at a low
[00:20:55] level and a lot of my studying was at a
[00:20:58] low level in anyway um even though I
[00:21:00] knew I was going to be tested at a
[00:21:02] higher level so I knew that there were
[00:21:04] going to be questions that asked me to
[00:21:06] discuss a web of Concepts together where
[00:21:08] I need to use knowledge in a very
[00:21:11] interconnected way in a more complex
[00:21:14] more nuanced kind of application but I
[00:21:17] would only test myself like with
[00:21:20] flashcards uh you know answering
[00:21:21] individual like single questions and I
[00:21:24] never tested like whether I can actually
[00:21:25] do that higher level of thinking and lo
[00:21:28] and behold I S an exam which questions
[00:21:31] do I struggle with the most the
[00:21:33] complicated ones so just think to
[00:21:35] yourself how am I going to be tested on
[00:21:37] this how do I need to use my knowledge
[00:21:40] and make sure that you are testing
[00:21:41] yourself in that same way so you can
[00:21:44] find the gaps that are relevant to you
[00:21:45] number eight test yourself in different
[00:21:49] ways so let's say you're learning to
[00:21:51] play tennis then there's a theory of
[00:21:55] understanding how to play understanding
[00:21:56] the rules knowing technically how you're
[00:21:58] me to do a serve and and do your
[00:22:00] forehand and backhand but then there's
[00:22:03] the ability to actually do it and it's
[00:22:06] understanding the tiny tiny little
[00:22:08] nuances where you know I guess
[00:22:11] theoretically you could learn that
[00:22:14] through a textbook but realistically it
[00:22:17] it just be overwhelming it's like how
[00:22:18] You' position your foot exactly you know
[00:22:20] how you arch your back when you do a
[00:22:22] serve where you're looking these tiny
[00:22:24] tiny little things that allow you to
[00:22:26] execute on what you what you know
[00:22:29] and so the first one which is the theory
[00:22:32] is the what that's called declarative
[00:22:34] knowledge and the second one which is
[00:22:37] being able to do it the how that's
[00:22:40] called procedural knowledge and in a lot
[00:22:42] of subjects you need both great example
[00:22:46] is maths or physics where there is a
[00:22:49] declarative knowledge set of the
[00:22:51] concepts and understanding what things
[00:22:54] are and being able to Define things and
[00:22:56] being able to look at a question and say
[00:22:57] okay I can understand what relevant
[00:23:00] Concepts there are and how I can chain
[00:23:02] them together that's the declarative
[00:23:04] knowledge but then you have to actually
[00:23:06] be able to solve the problem like use
[00:23:08] the formula and do the right equations
[00:23:10] and know how to use the equations
[00:23:12] correctly and that's the procedural part
[00:23:15] same thing in software engineering or
[00:23:16] coding where you can understand how to
[00:23:18] use the code uh technically what the
[00:23:22] language is and how to use you know
[00:23:24] different parts of it and then there's
[00:23:26] the ability to actually write good bug
[00:23:29] free code the problem arises when you
[00:23:32] only focus on one of them a great
[00:23:35] example again is math where mass is
[00:23:37] often really heavily focus on the
[00:23:39] procedural knowledge so people spend
[00:23:40] most of their time just like solving
[00:23:42] problems and just doing equations so
[00:23:46] when they get a question that requires
[00:23:48] them to think about it a bit more
[00:23:49] conceptually maybe it's a little bit
[00:23:51] more abstract they don't really know how
[00:23:52] to approach it because they have never
[00:23:54] thought about the concepts behind it and
[00:23:57] so that will be a failure of not really
[00:23:58] learning and then testing yourself in
[00:24:00] the declarative type of knowledge and
[00:24:03] you don't always need both types like
[00:24:06] sub some subjects like biology for
[00:24:08] example are often very just like
[00:24:09] declarative concept focused but you do
[00:24:12] need to test yourself again in the way
[00:24:15] that you know you're going to be tested
[00:24:16] to see whether you have gaps in your
[00:24:18] declarative or procedural knowledge part
[00:24:20] and so once you test yourself often and
[00:24:23] in different levels and with a balance
[00:24:25] of declarative and procedural like
[00:24:26] actually doing stuff as well well then
[00:24:29] you'll find gaps now the question is
[00:24:32] what do you do with the mistakes you
[00:24:34] make number
[00:24:35] nine assume you'll make every mistake
[00:24:39] again I think one of the most common and
[00:24:42] detrimental myths about learning is
[00:24:45] something I call silly mistake syndrome
[00:24:48] is the belief that the reason you got it
[00:24:50] wrong is a silly mistake but here's the
[00:24:53] thing it's probably not the truth is
[00:24:58] most people do not lose enough marks
[00:25:03] from silly mistakes for it to really
[00:25:06] matter I remember distinctly back when I
[00:25:09] was in my final year of high school
[00:25:11] sitting in the library doing these
[00:25:13] practice test questions and what I would
[00:25:16] do is I would write the answer and then
[00:25:18] I would check the answer sheet straight
[00:25:20] away and then which by the way that's
[00:25:23] not a good technique uh and I'd check
[00:25:25] the answer sheet straight away and then
[00:25:26] I'd read the answer and
[00:25:29] sometimes I'd get it wrong but it's not
[00:25:31] because I was completely wrong it's
[00:25:32] because there's just like this one point
[00:25:34] that I missed but I know the point I
[00:25:37] understand it I already studied it I
[00:25:39] just forgot to add that point in that
[00:25:42] particular answer and so I'd look at
[00:25:43] that and I'd say yeah that's just a
[00:25:45] silly mistake and so I do these practice
[00:25:48] questions and you know my test result
[00:25:50] when I did it would be like
[00:25:53] 95% and then I'd sit the actual exam and
[00:25:55] I'd get like 85% and I'd look at the
[00:25:58] answer sheet and be like man I just
[00:26:00] missed those little points and I used to
[00:26:03] think that that was because of me making
[00:26:06] silly mistakes until I
[00:26:08] realized there are still
[00:26:11] people who are not making silly mistakes
[00:26:15] why am I the one that is suffering from
[00:26:17] the silly mistakes am I just a silly
[00:26:20] person and that's when I decided to just
[00:26:25] assume it's not a silly mistake just
[00:26:28] assume that every time I make a mistake
[00:26:31] there's a legitimate reason for me to
[00:26:34] have made that mistake there's a real
[00:26:35] Gap in my knowledge and when I shifted
[00:26:37] that perspective what it helped me
[00:26:38] realize is that when I'm writing
[00:26:41] something and I missed a point and I
[00:26:42] look at the answer sheet and I'm like oh
[00:26:43] yeah that makes sense I already knew
[00:26:45] that it doesn't
[00:26:47] matter it doesn't matter that I knew and
[00:26:51] I can understand the answer sheet if I
[00:26:55] wasn't able to generate that answer it
[00:26:58] it means that there's a gap and I
[00:26:59] started seeing these tiny misalignments
[00:27:03] with how I had studied the topic this
[00:27:05] point that I'd missed it's not a silly
[00:27:08] mistake to have missed it now that I
[00:27:09] really dive deeper I genuinely didn't
[00:27:12] really understand why it was so
[00:27:14] important to add into the answer in the
[00:27:17] first place and after studying a little
[00:27:18] bit more I realized okay actually not
[00:27:21] having that point doesn't make sense if
[00:27:24] I really understood the answer to this
[00:27:27] then I would included it because leaving
[00:27:29] it out is actually incomplete and
[00:27:32] speaking as a coach uh there are very
[00:27:36] very few times when someone is making a
[00:27:40] silly mistake while having genuinely
[00:27:44] good levels of knowledge the people who
[00:27:47] make silly mistakes
[00:27:49] consistently these are almost always the
[00:27:52] same people who have gaps in their
[00:27:54] knowledge number 10 do spaced repetition
[00:27:58] an active recall properly if you spent
[00:28:02] any amount of time watching studying and
[00:28:04] learning videos you will have heard of
[00:28:06] space repetition and active recall um if
[00:28:09] you haven't then I'll really quickly
[00:28:11] summarize it space repetition is when
[00:28:12] you take something that you've learned
[00:28:14] and then you repeat it you usually test
[00:28:16] yourself uh in some kind of spacing
[00:28:18] interval so it could be you learn
[00:28:20] something on one day and then a week
[00:28:22] later you test yourself and you test
[00:28:23] yourself again two weeks later and you
[00:28:24] test yourself you know a month later or
[00:28:26] something like that and it's effective
[00:28:28] because of something called the spacing
[00:28:29] effect which is basically that your
[00:28:31] memory is enhanced when you repeat
[00:28:34] things after a certain weight period
[00:28:36] active recall is when you recall
[00:28:39] something from your memory actually it's
[00:28:41] any time you're retrieving Knowledge
[00:28:43] from your memory is technically active
[00:28:44] recall so a great example is if someone
[00:28:47] asks you a question and you answer that
[00:28:48] question from memory you're doing active
[00:28:50] recall and space repetition and active
[00:28:52] recoil often paired together because a
[00:28:54] lot of techniques use them together you
[00:28:57] do a space repetition session using
[00:29:00] active recall so for example if you
[00:29:02] learn something on Monday and you test
[00:29:04] yourself with some practice questions
[00:29:05] and flash cards on Saturday then that's
[00:29:08] a spaced active recall session that
[00:29:12] you're doing and what most people focus
[00:29:14] on is just making sure that spacing is
[00:29:18] really good and uh you know hitting
[00:29:21] their active recall sessions on anything
[00:29:24] that's due when the app tells them hey
[00:29:26] you need to revise this again but the
[00:29:28] truth about learning is that the spacing
[00:29:30] part is first of all easy to do and much
[00:29:35] less important than the active recall
[00:29:36] part and how you do your active recall
[00:29:39] makes a very big difference to how
[00:29:42] effective the technique is going to be
[00:29:45] at producing learning so there's
[00:29:46] actually two different types of active
[00:29:48] recall arguably some people say that
[00:29:50] there's three the first one is cued
[00:29:53] recall cued recall is when there is a q
[00:29:57] like like uh fill in the blanks or a
[00:30:00] question prompt uh that that gets you to
[00:30:03] trigger that memory free recall is when
[00:30:07] you don't have that cue so something
[00:30:10] like just writing an essay more openly
[00:30:13] about a certain topic that might be
[00:30:15] something like free recall if it's a
[00:30:16] very open-ended question that will be
[00:30:18] like free recall and then there's
[00:30:19] actually a third type some people say
[00:30:21] which is
[00:30:22] recognition uh or recognition based
[00:30:25] recall which is you see something and
[00:30:28] you assess whether you can recognize it
[00:30:31] on if whether it feels like it's a it's
[00:30:33] a new thing and the main benefit of
[00:30:35] active recall comes from the free recall
[00:30:38] not the cued recall and definitely not
[00:30:42] from recognition but most people don't
[00:30:44] realize that these three things are
[00:30:46] different let's say you have a flash
[00:30:48] card that asks you a specific question
[00:30:51] and then you answer that question and
[00:30:53] the answer to that question is like one
[00:30:55] or two words that's cute
[00:30:58] what that means is that when you answer
[00:31:01] that question what you're training your
[00:31:02] ability to do is recalling that fact
[00:31:05] from that cue which means anytime you're
[00:31:09] asked about that information without
[00:31:12] that cue it becomes harder and sometimes
[00:31:14] you can actually tell this happens when
[00:31:17] you have a flash card that you've done
[00:31:20] so many times that without even
[00:31:23] finishing reading the question you
[00:31:26] already know the answer like the recall
[00:31:28] you have is within 2 or 3 seconds just
[00:31:31] you read the first few words and you
[00:31:32] already remember that the rest of the
[00:31:34] question goes like this and therefore
[00:31:36] this is the answer to it if you're at
[00:31:38] that point you're no longer actually
[00:31:42] testing on your ability to recall that
[00:31:45] knowledge all you're doing is you're
[00:31:47] testing your ability to match these
[00:31:49] words to these words so one thing that
[00:31:52] you can do and this is a tip that I give
[00:31:53] to everyone who's using flash cards is
[00:31:55] to swap out your cues change your
[00:31:58] questions regularly especially the ones
[00:32:00] that you're consistently getting right
[00:32:01] start changing the actual question
[00:32:04] you're asking you can still testing the
[00:32:06] same Concepts or the same facts but just
[00:32:08] change the way you're queuing yourself
[00:32:10] but the worst one is people that do just
[00:32:13] recognition where they'll have a flash
[00:32:15] card they'll try to remember it and then
[00:32:17] they can't but instead of just admitting
[00:32:20] that you failed to remember it and often
[00:32:24] this happens with people that have a ton
[00:32:26] of flash cards because they know that as
[00:32:27] soon as as they mark it wrong they're
[00:32:28] going to have to do that again in like
[00:32:30] the next few hours what they do is they
[00:32:33] just click the answer they look at the
[00:32:35] answer and then they think oh yeah
[00:32:36] that's right it's like yeah we know it's
[00:32:40] right it's the answer so there's no
[00:32:43] point doing that like you you that's the
[00:32:44] ultimate illusion like you're tricking
[00:32:46] yourself into thinking that you know it
[00:32:47] you literally just proved that you
[00:32:50] didn't know it so if you go and fall
[00:32:53] into this trap where because you
[00:32:55] recognized it you think that means that
[00:32:57] you can actually recall it that's a
[00:33:00] that's a huge red flag and here's the
[00:33:01] golden tip worry more about how you're
[00:33:05] doing your active recall then you're
[00:33:07] spacing when you do really good active
[00:33:10] recall you've got more of room for error
[00:33:13] with your spacing when your active
[00:33:15] recall method is really bad very very
[00:33:18] cued or even recognition based then your
[00:33:22] memory of that is so fragile you need to
[00:33:25] repeat that like every 1 or two days
[00:33:28] otherwise you're losing that memory we
[00:33:29] call it knowledge Decay your knowledge
[00:33:31] Decay is very fast when you have an
[00:33:33] active recoil that induces more learning
[00:33:36] then your knowledge Decay is slower and
[00:33:38] your memory is stronger which means you
[00:33:39] don't actually have to space it so
[00:33:42] frequently you can get away with not
[00:33:43] looking at it for like one or two or
[00:33:45] three weeks so start doing more free
[00:33:48] recall yes it does take more time and
[00:33:51] effort and it's not as brain dead easy
[00:33:54] as just spamming 100 flash cards
[00:33:58] but also when it comes to learning you
[00:34:00] don't really want brain dead number 11
[00:34:03] root memorize but only as a last resort
[00:34:07] what is root memorization root
[00:34:10] memorization is learning through
[00:34:13] repetition it is boring it is monotonous
[00:34:16] it is very tedious if all you're doing
[00:34:19] with learning is rot
[00:34:20] memorization your life of learning is
[00:34:22] going to be painful and excruciating and
[00:34:26] probably not very effective effective
[00:34:28] and I for the longest time most of my
[00:34:30] learning was just wrote memorization in
[00:34:32] fact I didn't even really know that
[00:34:36] there were other ways of learning for me
[00:34:39] it was just sometimes I can understand
[00:34:41] it and it will just click and I don't
[00:34:43] need to rote memorize it because I just
[00:34:45] I just get it but then sometimes I can't
[00:34:48] get it and then I have to rot memorize
[00:34:49] it and so that's not really a technique
[00:34:52] you know that's not a that's not a
[00:34:53] learning system and the reason rot
[00:34:55] memorization needs to be a last resort
[00:34:57] is not because it's not
[00:35:00] effective R memorization is a tool like
[00:35:04] any other and you do need to R memorize
[00:35:07] things sometimes sometimes there really
[00:35:09] are things that are so irrelevant where
[00:35:11] the only reason that you would need to
[00:35:12] know this is because you're tested on it
[00:35:14] and that's not a great you know
[00:35:17] situation to be in but sometimes you
[00:35:19] have to wrote memorize but the problem
[00:35:22] is that it creates a very surface level
[00:35:25] very isolated kind of knowledge which
[00:35:27] means that you can only use that
[00:35:28] knowledge in that way like just
[00:35:30] regurgitation of words so if you need to
[00:35:32] use that knowledge for anything more
[00:35:34] complicated like a higher level of
[00:35:35] knowledge then Ro memorization is not
[00:35:38] going to be a good tool to use and I can
[00:35:40] promise you you cannot root memorize
[00:35:43] your way to success but there is
[00:35:45] actually another problem with root
[00:35:47] memorization which is that it is by
[00:35:51] definition very time inefficient a lot
[00:35:55] of rote memorization is
[00:35:59] repetitive and just spamming flash cards
[00:36:02] is a great reason for it by the way
[00:36:04] again like I'm I'm not on a personal
[00:36:06] like I'm not getting I'm not getting
[00:36:07] paid by like a big mind map to uh hate
[00:36:11] on flash cards every chance that I get
[00:36:13] it just so happens that it's a great
[00:36:16] example for a lot of mistakes that
[00:36:17] people make when you use flash cards a
[00:36:21] lot of people will create flash cards
[00:36:25] and feel great making flash cards and
[00:36:30] not realize that for every flash card
[00:36:32] they make you have to pay that back
[00:36:35] three four fivefold in the future it's
[00:36:39] debt you're creating learning debt and
[00:36:42] this is another illusion of learning
[00:36:45] where you feel good making 100 flash
[00:36:47] cards but it didn't really contribute to
[00:36:50] your learning until you do it so if it
[00:36:52] takes you a minute to create a flash
[00:36:55] card for example you're going to need 5
[00:36:57] minutes in the future to answer that so
[00:37:01] I used to spend like like over an hour
[00:37:04] every day making flash cards then I need
[00:37:07] 5 hours later in the future to go
[00:37:11] through and answer them and do them to
[00:37:14] the point where I'm receiving the
[00:37:16] benefit of it like it's in my memory but
[00:37:19] I'm doing that like every day so if I'm
[00:37:21] doing that five days a week for example
[00:37:23] then that's five hours of flash cards
[00:37:25] I'm now giving myself 20 25 hours of
[00:37:29] work to do the next week and this is why
[00:37:32] it's very easy to get into this cycle
[00:37:34] where you're spending hours and hours
[00:37:36] and hours every single day just doing
[00:37:38] flash cards and some of my students are
[00:37:39] doing like they're doing like five six
[00:37:42] hours of flash cards a day and if that
[00:37:44] sounds extreme to you you're right that
[00:37:47] is Extreme and if that's
[00:37:49] you that's a problem that's not scalable
[00:37:53] that's not
[00:37:54] sustainable and it's understanding that
[00:37:57] if every flash card you make is creating
[00:38:00] debt for yourself and so you want to
[00:38:01] minimize that if you can get away with
[00:38:04] not having to use repetition you're
[00:38:06] saving time and even if it takes a
[00:38:08] little bit longer right now to learn it
[00:38:12] and learn it probably the first time you
[00:38:14] should do that rather than just giving
[00:38:16] that work and multiplying it and letting
[00:38:20] your future self deal with it and if you
[00:38:22] feel overwhelmed right now with your
[00:38:25] work volume it's probably probably
[00:38:27] because your past self did that to you
[00:38:30] one of the St I worked with last year
[00:38:32] his name is Tony he's a chemical
[00:38:34] materials student from Taiwan and in
[00:38:37] Asia there's this huge culture of Road
[00:38:40] memorization it's like a whole thing and
[00:38:42] he was you know pretty skeptical about
[00:38:45] doing less rope memorization because he
[00:38:46] felt like there was no other way that he
[00:38:47] could learn it we cut down his rope
[00:38:49] memorization so if 100% is everything he
[00:38:51] had to learn he was learning like 90% of
[00:38:54] it through just rope memorization and so
[00:38:56] we managed to to cut that down just to
[00:38:58] 70% and that's only a 20% reduction in
[00:39:02] the amount that you need to rot memorize
[00:39:04] Tony went from studying like 60 hours
[00:39:08] per week to 30 hours per week we were
[00:39:10] able to have the amount of time that he
[00:39:13] was studying by reducing the amount he
[00:39:15] was rot memorizing just by 20% and
[00:39:17] that's because of the volume scaling
[00:39:20] issue with with rope memorization is
[00:39:22] that a small reduction in how much you
[00:39:25] need to rope memorize has a big impact
[00:39:27] and the amount of time that you burden
[00:39:29] yourself with but let's say we do need
[00:39:32] to use R memorization it's a last resort
[00:39:35] but we're at the resort right now then
[00:39:38] how should you do it number 12 use flash
[00:39:41] cards memory palaces and Link methods
[00:39:44] for Road memorization I'm not going to
[00:39:46] explain each of these different
[00:39:47] techniques you can look them up there's
[00:39:49] lots of great videos and tutorials about
[00:39:51] how to use these methods but they work
[00:39:54] they are very very effective for for
[00:39:57] their purpose just make sure to use them
[00:40:00] for their purpose don't abuse them and
[00:40:02] remember it's the last result number 13
[00:40:06] study with
[00:40:07] friends sometimes I remember in my third
[00:40:10] year of medical school I was really
[00:40:12] obsessed with figuring out how I could
[00:40:14] study with friends I think part of it
[00:40:16] might have just been I was like socially
[00:40:18] deprived from spending so much time
[00:40:21] either studying or learning to study and
[00:40:25] I I wanted to kind of spice things up in
[00:40:28] my life you can get a sense for what my
[00:40:30] life was like based on the fact that
[00:40:31] that was spicy for me um and so I
[00:40:34] actually ended up doing a lot of
[00:40:36] experimenting but also learning about
[00:40:38] good ways of studying with friends and
[00:40:40] what I found is that studying with
[00:40:42] friends can be really effective but
[00:40:45] probably not in the way that most people
[00:40:48] do them so there are two main benefits
[00:40:51] that I found for studying with friends
[00:40:52] the first one is for accountability and
[00:40:55] focus especially if you get e IL
[00:40:57] distracted having friends to keep you
[00:41:00] focused and keep you accountable can be
[00:41:02] useful unfortunately sometimes they're
[00:41:04] the cause of the distraction so in order
[00:41:06] for this to work you actually have to
[00:41:08] have everyone in that group needs to
[00:41:11] have the shared purpose and
[00:41:13] understanding of why you're studying
[00:41:14] together like there has to be like an
[00:41:15] agenda like okay we all think the same
[00:41:18] way we are here to hold each other
[00:41:20] accountable to be real with each other
[00:41:23] to keep each other focused and I would
[00:41:26] highly recommend implementing some kind
[00:41:28] of system or like structure use timers
[00:41:32] uh use like have the you like a schedule
[00:41:35] laid out tell people that your
[00:41:37] responsibility for the session is to
[00:41:39] keep time or to make sure no one gets
[00:41:41] distracted like assign roles to people
[00:41:44] make it like a job take it
[00:41:46] seriously I mean if you're just studying
[00:41:48] with friends just to like have fun and
[00:41:50] spice up your life then you can do
[00:41:52] whatever uh but if it's to really
[00:41:54] actually make it effective and like
[00:41:56] promote optimal learning then create
[00:41:58] structure the second benefit of studying
[00:42:02] with friends and this is something I
[00:42:03] almost never see in students like
[00:42:06] outside of in my program that I'm
[00:42:07] directly teaching this to is use your
[00:42:10] friends to find gaps for each other so
[00:42:13] one of the things that I used to do very
[00:42:14] often is just like quizzing each other
[00:42:16] and that's great but it's not usually
[00:42:20] sustainable it's not enough you can make
[00:42:22] that into a whole part of your learning
[00:42:24] system and this is an awesome technique
[00:42:27] like seriously so
[00:42:31] underrated make practice tests for your
[00:42:35] friends as part of the way you do your
[00:42:38] space repetition active recour sessions
[00:42:40] I was telling you like test yourself at
[00:42:42] different levels uh different ways
[00:42:45] making a practice exam for someone else
[00:42:49] is a great way of revising as long as
[00:42:51] you're trying to make it from memory and
[00:42:53] that means that after you've made your
[00:42:55] exam you then need to check with your
[00:42:58] notes to make sure that the exam makes
[00:43:01] sense and then you can create your own
[00:43:04] perfect model answer sheet for the
[00:43:06] questions that you made which is great
[00:43:09] learning but then by exchanging them
[00:43:11] with your friends you now get the
[00:43:13] questions and perspectives that they
[00:43:14] made and if you're trying to make truly
[00:43:16] challenging questions then this is like
[00:43:20] like a like a infinite practice paper
[00:43:22] glitch and the best part is that there's
[00:43:24] no real answer sheet with which sounds
[00:43:27] like a disadvantage but it is a massive
[00:43:30] Advantage because when you know that
[00:43:32] there is no answer sheet you have to
[00:43:35] check that your answers make sense you
[00:43:37] have to be much more critical reviewing
[00:43:40] the notes reviewing your material to
[00:43:42] make sure that there's nothing missing
[00:43:44] and a lot of the time the answers that
[00:43:46] you write for your friend's exam will be
[00:43:50] different to the answer sheet that they
[00:43:52] made for their own exam and those points
[00:43:55] of difference actually become really
[00:43:57] good areas for discussion those usually
[00:43:59] indicate pretty deep and nuanced gaps in
[00:44:01] knowledge and if you get a group of like
[00:44:03] three or four friends to do this then in
[00:44:05] the time it takes to make one exam and
[00:44:09] then make an answer sheet which you're
[00:44:11] spending that time studying anyway you
[00:44:13] now also get three extra exams it is
[00:44:17] very time efficient it is very effective
[00:44:18] for Learning and it is
[00:44:20] even fun and yes I I promise I do other
[00:44:23] things in my life other than study for
[00:44:25] fun next piece of advice
[00:44:27] study ahead to get ahead I'm going to
[00:44:30] blow your mind with this one let's say
[00:44:32] you're falling behind or you're
[00:44:33] strugling to keep up first of all we got
[00:44:35] to accept the truth the reason you're
[00:44:37] falling behind is because whatever you
[00:44:39] are doing right now isn't enough for the
[00:44:43] pace it needs to be and to stop falling
[00:44:46] behind the easiest way is to get
[00:44:50] ahead and you don't actually need to
[00:44:54] catch up to get ahead and this is the
[00:44:58] mindblowing thing for a lot of
[00:45:00] students imagine you're in a sinking
[00:45:02] ship you don't need to get all the water
[00:45:06] out of the ship first before you plug
[00:45:09] the hole in fact that's illogical you
[00:45:13] plug the hole first it's the same thing
[00:45:14] with learning if you're falling behind
[00:45:16] now there's this backlog of stuff that
[00:45:19] you need to study and catch up on you
[00:45:22] can keep chipping away at that debt of
[00:45:25] learning but just make sure your not
[00:45:27] accumulating more debt and the reason
[00:45:30] that you're like kind of a little
[00:45:31] screwed if you don't do this is because
[00:45:34] remember if you're falling behind or
[00:45:37] struggling to keep up it means what
[00:45:41] you're doing now is not enough so you
[00:45:45] will definitely keep falling behind and
[00:45:48] if you've already got a debt and a
[00:45:50] backlog of stuff to chip away at that's
[00:45:52] going to get larger not smaller with
[00:45:55] time and so as soon as you realize
[00:45:57] you're falling behind you should at that
[00:45:59] point plug the leak and one of the best
[00:46:01] and fastest ways to do that if you're
[00:46:04] short on time which you probably are CU
[00:46:06] you're falling behind is to scope every
[00:46:10] subject to 10x your learning efficiency
[00:46:14] I personally believe that no learning
[00:46:17] system can be called efficient if it
[00:46:20] doesn't involve scoping a subject before
[00:46:23] you learn it so what do I mean by
[00:46:25] scoping a subject it means going through
[00:46:27] what you're about to learn and getting a
[00:46:30] big picture overview of what it's
[00:46:33] talking about what are the main ideas
[00:46:35] what are the main groups of ideas and
[00:46:37] how does it generally connect together
[00:46:40] it's not about memorizing everything you
[00:46:43] need to memorize and all the new pieces
[00:46:44] of terminology and mastering it before
[00:46:48] you learn it in class or in lectures
[00:46:50] it's just about getting enough of an
[00:46:52] idea about it that it feels a bit more
[00:46:55] familiar and in learning science this is
[00:46:57] called priming and priming is a studying
[00:47:00] technique that has a very high
[00:47:03] correlation with learning when you prime
[00:47:05] knowledge it basically gives your brain
[00:47:08] context and relevance for what it's
[00:47:10] about to learn you're telling it why
[00:47:12] it's important and where it maybe fits
[00:47:16] before you're telling it what it is a
[00:47:18] great analogy is thinking about a
[00:47:20] library imagine you are the sole
[00:47:22] librarian of this huge library and
[00:47:26] people are turning books that they've
[00:47:28] read and you have to put these books
[00:47:31] away in the appropriate place but you
[00:47:34] don't actually know how the library is
[00:47:36] organized you don't know where the
[00:47:38] shelves are for which authors for which
[00:47:41] genres all you're getting is a pile of
[00:47:43] books coming at you every few minutes
[00:47:46] and you desperately need to put those
[00:47:48] books in the right place imagine how
[00:47:50] hard that would be compared to if 15
[00:47:55] minutes before your shift shift started
[00:47:57] you went into the library and you
[00:47:59] generally got a sense of where the
[00:48:01] categories and what the shelving
[00:48:03] organization structure looks like now
[00:48:05] when someone gives you the book and you
[00:48:07] look at it you can think ah yeah This
[00:48:08] one belongs somewhere over there and you
[00:48:09] may not know exactly where on the Shelf
[00:48:12] it fits but you know where the Shelf is
[00:48:14] the same thing for your brain when
[00:48:16] you're learning something new your
[00:48:17] brain's trying to figure out what it is
[00:48:19] and understand it and it's also trying
[00:48:20] to decide why is this relevant enough
[00:48:23] for me to spend energy on remember Ing
[00:48:27] and keeping this knowledge your brain
[00:48:29] isn't helping you pass an exam your
[00:48:31] brain is just trying to keep you alive
[00:48:33] and it is a very energy consuming organ
[00:48:36] which means that if you're giving it
[00:48:38] random irrelevant information that
[00:48:40] doesn't fit anywhere your brain is going
[00:48:42] to aggressively remove it because from
[00:48:44] your brain's perspective it's a matter
[00:48:45] of life and death and while there are
[00:48:47] many ways to prime your brain just
[00:48:49] scoping the subject and getting a layer
[00:48:51] of the land is a really high impact
[00:48:55] strategy that you you can use that is
[00:48:57] going to have a noticeable difference on
[00:49:00] your memory and retention as well as how
[00:49:02] deeply and easily you can understand New
[00:49:04] Concepts next up use cognitive load to
[00:49:08] delete passive learning cognitive load
[00:49:12] is the fancy term for mental effort
[00:49:15] effective learning always involves
[00:49:19] mental effort passive learning is the
[00:49:23] type of learning that doesn't involve
[00:49:26] High mental effort and in fact it's not
[00:49:29] really even learning so rewriting notes
[00:49:33] is fairly passive if you're just writing
[00:49:35] it again word for word rereading things
[00:49:38] is also fairly passive and different
[00:49:41] techniques on that spectrum of how much
[00:49:44] studying turns into learning have
[00:49:46] different levels of mental effort
[00:49:48] associated with them and generally the
[00:49:49] more effective ones have more mental
[00:49:51] effort so for example creating summary
[00:49:54] pages is more effective and then turning
[00:49:56] those summary pages into something
[00:49:57] that's nonlinear and relational takes a
[00:49:59] little bit more eff effort and then
[00:50:01] teaching it to a 10-year-old and
[00:50:03] simplifying those relationships and
[00:50:05] groups that takes even more effort and
[00:50:06] this is simply just because the learning
[00:50:09] is what happens in your brain so your
[00:50:12] brain has to do thinking and processing
[00:50:15] to turn information into relevant
[00:50:18] knowledge it takes effort and the way we
[00:50:22] feel that that mental exertion that's
[00:50:25] what we call cognitive load and now not
[00:50:27] everything that has high cognitive load
[00:50:30] makes it effective like for example if
[00:50:32] all you wanted to do was max out your
[00:50:34] cognitive load you can stand on like a
[00:50:37] stand on one foot while you're juggling
[00:50:39] and someone's slapping you in the face
[00:50:41] with a fish while you read a textbook
[00:50:43] your cognitive load is going to be
[00:50:44] through the roof but it's not going to
[00:50:46] make a difference to your learning and
[00:50:48] so not all high cognitive load is
[00:50:51] effective learning but all effective
[00:50:53] learning involves higher cognitive load
[00:50:55] but whenever your cognitive load is low
[00:50:58] you can know for sure that you're not
[00:51:02] engaging in effective learning and so
[00:51:04] you want to be able to train yourself to
[00:51:06] be aware when you're studying what's the
[00:51:10] level of mental exertion cognitive load
[00:51:12] that I'm feeling and if it's high okay
[00:51:14] that's fine right if it's low there's a
[00:51:18] high high high likelihood that you're
[00:51:20] doing passive learning and those need to
[00:51:22] be massive red flags that you look at
[00:51:25] and optimize or just completely remove
[00:51:28] that out of your learning system and in
[00:51:29] fact you can even do a quick test have a
[00:51:32] study session for like one or two days
[00:51:34] and then identify the techniques and the
[00:51:37] methods that you use where you feel that
[00:51:39] your brain is entering into that passive
[00:51:41] State it's feeling boring it's feeling
[00:51:43] tedious it's feeling monotonous you're
[00:51:45] kind of falling asleep and getting
[00:51:47] drowsy uh those are areas where your
[00:51:50] brain is basically falling
[00:51:52] asleep just try studying a topic without
[00:51:55] doing any of that stuff just literally
[00:51:58] remove it from your system and you know
[00:52:00] what you will probably find that there
[00:52:02] is no real difference to how much you
[00:52:06] learn and you've saved that much time
[00:52:09] and some of you will do this and be like
[00:52:11] well man that's like 90% of all my
[00:52:13] studying feels like that you know surely
[00:52:16] my learning has gone down NOP it just
[00:52:19] means that 90% of the time you spent on
[00:52:22] studying was kind of a waste of time and
[00:52:25] I'm saying that from phys
[00:52:27] where that used to be me so much of my
[00:52:30] learning was passive and it took me a
[00:52:33] very long time longer than hopefully it
[00:52:35] will take you with my videos uh to fix
[00:52:38] that and make it more active next up
[00:52:40] these two are pretty juicy create
[00:52:44] analogies an analogy if you don't know
[00:52:47] is just when you're comparing two
[00:52:48] different things to highlight how these
[00:52:51] things are similar to each other like
[00:52:52] for example if I say life is like a
[00:52:55] journey then that's an analogy because
[00:52:57] I'm highlighting the similarities
[00:52:59] between life and a journey and creating
[00:53:02] analogies is actually a great example of
[00:53:04] a technique that requires higher
[00:53:06] cognitive load because to create a good
[00:53:08] analogy you have to look at two
[00:53:10] different concepts and compare them and
[00:53:12] look at how they're similar and that
[00:53:14] takes effort and and that comparison
[00:53:16] that process your brain undergoes to
[00:53:18] figure that out that produces high
[00:53:21] quality learning and actively forming
[00:53:23] analogies from what you're learning is a
[00:53:25] criminally underrated technique so make
[00:53:28] analogies and if you're already making
[00:53:30] analogies then you can make them even
[00:53:32] better by
[00:53:34] critiquing those analogies so let's say
[00:53:37] I take an analogy like life is a journey
[00:53:41] critiquing that means really examining
[00:53:44] the analogy that I've created to see how
[00:53:47] accurate and comprehensive it is so I
[00:53:50] might say okay but life is also kind of
[00:53:53] not like a journey because life is more
[00:53:56] unpredictable you don't know where
[00:53:58] you're headed whereas with most Journeys
[00:54:00] you kind of know where the end point is
[00:54:02] and you can kind of map out what the
[00:54:04] path is going to be so you might say
[00:54:06] Okay okay so actually in that case life
[00:54:08] is more like a spontaneous journey and
[00:54:11] you might say okay well but also life
[00:54:14] has more unpredictable elements and
[00:54:16] sometimes you find yourself somewhere
[00:54:18] that you never intended to be whereas
[00:54:19] with a journey you can usually figure
[00:54:22] out where you want to go and then and
[00:54:23] then go there without too much
[00:54:25] complication might say okay in that case
[00:54:27] life is like a spontaneous journey
[00:54:30] through a foggy treacherous forest
[00:54:34] mountain okay you see what's going on is
[00:54:35] that the analogy is growing in order to
[00:54:39] be more comprehensive and accurate of
[00:54:42] whatever we're learning about in this
[00:54:43] case it happened to be life and when you
[00:54:45] apply your brain in that way to critique
[00:54:48] an analogy and enhance it it forces you
[00:54:51] to examine the information and the topic
[00:54:54] much more deeply and much more
[00:54:55] critically and that also induces a
[00:54:58] higher level of cognitive load which
[00:55:00] also translates through to a higher
[00:55:02] level of learning and again you can
[00:55:03] actually just test this you can take two
[00:55:06] sets of Concepts or two topics that You'
[00:55:08] have just studied make a really simple
[00:55:10] analogy for one of them and don't
[00:55:12] critique it and then make another
[00:55:14] analogy for the other topic but then
[00:55:16] critique it and then spend a bit of time
[00:55:18] really making that analogy more polished
[00:55:20] give yourself a week and then see which
[00:55:23] topic you feel more confident on 99 out
[00:55:25] of 100 times the analogy you spent time
[00:55:28] on critiquing your memory and your depth
[00:55:30] of understanding and the Nuance to how
[00:55:32] you understand each of those individual
[00:55:35] Parts is going to be deeper and finally
[00:55:38] keep a learning
[00:55:40] log if you are serious about learning to
[00:55:44] learn then you are going to be going
[00:55:47] through a journey uh through a it's not
[00:55:51] quite a treacherous Mountain Forest but
[00:55:54] it is a long process to really create a
[00:55:58] personalized learning system and there
[00:56:00] are a lot of things about your habits
[00:56:02] and your processes and your techniques
[00:56:04] you're going to have to change and it is
[00:56:06] impossible to change too many things at
[00:56:09] once in fact it's actually biologically
[00:56:11] impossible your brain has this uh maybe
[00:56:14] protective mechanism that's wired into
[00:56:17] it that stops IT from changing too many
[00:56:20] things in a short period of time which
[00:56:22] means that you can only really focus on
[00:56:24] changing one or two things at a time and
[00:56:27] for learning where there are like
[00:56:29] hundreds of factors that influence your
[00:56:31] ability to learn it's going to take you
[00:56:33] a while and at a certain point and
[00:56:36] everyone who is serious about improving
[00:56:40] their learning is going to face this
[00:56:41] you're going to become overwhelmed with
[00:56:43] the amount of things that you're trying
[00:56:44] to change and the experiments you're
[00:56:45] running and the mistakes that you're
[00:56:47] making the trial and error keep a
[00:56:49] learning log I so wish I kept a learning
[00:56:52] log 13 years ago when I first started my
[00:56:55] journey like that those three years of
[00:56:57] improvement I probably could have done
[00:56:58] that in like 9 months if I kept a
[00:57:00] learning log that tracks what am I
[00:57:03] testing what do I think is going to make
[00:57:04] a difference what technique am I trying
[00:57:06] today how did that go what am I going to
[00:57:08] do tomorrow if I just kept iterating
[00:57:11] that with more Focus instead of just
[00:57:12] doing this thing and then this thing and
[00:57:14] then this thing and this thing and then
[00:57:15] coming back to the first thing then it
[00:57:17] would have been so much faster and so
[00:57:19] much easier for me to improve but I
[00:57:21] didn't because I was lazy basically and
[00:57:24] I couldn't be bothered keeping a
[00:57:25] learning I just didn't think it was
[00:57:27] going to be necessary until it was too
[00:57:28] late in fact it's so important that all
[00:57:30] of the students that I train now through
[00:57:31] I can study like a learning log and
[00:57:34] reflective record is like one of the
[00:57:36] actual techniques that I teach now it
[00:57:38] just makes a huge difference and it
[00:57:40] helps enormously with motivation to see
[00:57:44] the progress that you're making that you
[00:57:46] can't necessarily see on the surface and
[00:57:49] so being able to look through your
[00:57:49] learning log and realize like man the
[00:57:51] stuff I used to think about and worry
[00:57:53] about and how I thought about learning
[00:57:55] like a month ago is completely different
[00:57:57] to how I understand it now that's really
[00:58:00] motivating so please make your life
[00:58:02] easier keep a learning log so that's my
[00:58:04] advice and honestly I can do like a
[00:58:07] hundred more of these because 13 years
[00:58:09] is a long time to just be learning about
[00:58:12] learning and I've picked up a lot of
[00:58:15] these lessons along the way if you
[00:58:16] enjoyed this format please let me know
[00:58:18] if you want me to do more of this again
[00:58:19] let me know and if you want to learn a
[00:58:21] little bit more about some of the
[00:58:22] techniques you can start applying to
[00:58:25] work on the things that I've talked
[00:58:26] about then check out this video here to
[00:58:30] help you on the next step of your
[00:58:32] Learning Journey


=== 4 Layers of Learning Every Student MUST Master ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rtSSM-C91I

[00:00:00] there are four layers of learning that
[00:00:02] any student or learner of any age should
[00:00:06] Master when we're able to master all
[00:00:07] four layers of learning it is genuinely
[00:00:09] one of the most powerful learning
[00:00:11] strategies that you can learn it allows
[00:00:13] us to have a better understanding and
[00:00:14] better retention it makes learning
[00:00:17] faster and it even makes learning more
[00:00:18] enjoyable unfortunately most of the
[00:00:20] students that I work with aren't able to
[00:00:22] follow the layers in the correct order
[00:00:26] when this happens it creates a lot of
[00:00:27] stress it wastes a lot of time and it
[00:00:29] can feel impossible to get the results
[00:00:31] you want and with enough time we can
[00:00:33] start thinking that maybe we'll just
[00:00:36] never be good at learning but that
[00:00:38] probably is not true for me learning to
[00:00:42] learn in these four layers is one of the
[00:00:45] reasons I was able to get top results in
[00:00:47] both medical school and for my master of
[00:00:49] education and trust me there's nothing
[00:00:52] special about me I'm not a genius I've
[00:00:54] seen similar results with thousands of
[00:00:56] students and professionals that I've
[00:00:58] trained over the years and so by the end
[00:00:59] of this video you'll know exactly which
[00:01:01] layer you tend to focus on but most
[00:01:04] importantly how you can master all four
[00:01:07] layers of learning now the first layer
[00:01:08] of learning is called the logic layer
[00:01:12] and this is by far the most overlooked
[00:01:16] but also the most important layer
[00:01:18] because without mastering this layer the
[00:01:20] other layers will not work which means
[00:01:22] you'll end up wasting hours of time
[00:01:24] studying without getting the results
[00:01:26] that you want why you may ask well as
[00:01:28] you can see from the diagram that I've
[00:01:29] I've drawn each layer of learning stacks
[00:01:33] on the previous
[00:01:35] layer efficient and effective learning
[00:01:37] should always build on itself which
[00:01:40] means the learning you do initially
[00:01:42] makes the learning you do later easier
[00:01:45] and easier I always say the more you
[00:01:47] learn the easier it should get but most
[00:01:49] students don't feel that way most
[00:01:51] students feel like the more they learn
[00:01:52] the more overwhelming it gets there's
[00:01:54] more things to try to hold on to in your
[00:01:56] memory and the reason that happens is
[00:01:58] because instead of approaching ing
[00:02:00] learning in the right order where we're
[00:02:02] going 1 2 3 4 most students do it in the
[00:02:07] opposite order they go 4 3 2 1 and then
[00:02:10] they end up with this and if the way you
[00:02:13] are learning looks like this instead of
[00:02:16] this then learning efficiently becomes
[00:02:18] almost impossible and the easy way to
[00:02:20] think about this is to think of learning
[00:02:22] like building a house you have to start
[00:02:24] with layer one which is the foundations
[00:02:27] and then on top of that layer you bu
[00:02:29] build the walls and the roof and the
[00:02:32] overall structure and then you paint the
[00:02:35] walls and then eventually you decorate
[00:02:38] and put in your furniture but what
[00:02:39] you'll see by the end of this video is
[00:02:41] that most students aren't doing that
[00:02:42] what they are doing is the learning
[00:02:44] equivalent of trying to build the walls
[00:02:46] without having a foundation and then
[00:02:49] they're only building like one corner of
[00:02:52] one room and then they're painting that
[00:02:54] and then chucking a couch in the corner
[00:02:56] and then starting to build the
[00:02:57] foundation of like another room and then
[00:02:59] build building that wall and somehow
[00:03:01] trying to make it all come together so
[00:03:03] really it doesn't matter how long you're
[00:03:04] spending on building the house it's just
[00:03:07] going to crumble if you don't have that
[00:03:09] good foundation to start with and in
[00:03:11] learning what a crumbling Foundation
[00:03:14] actually looks and feels like is hm I've
[00:03:17] technically covered this content why
[00:03:20] can't I remember and use this knowledge
[00:03:23] it probably means that you had weak
[00:03:26] foundations so when we're working on the
[00:03:27] logic layer it means that we're looking
[00:03:30] for the biggest ideas within that topic
[00:03:33] we're trying to focus on getting a big
[00:03:36] picture fairly basic understanding of
[00:03:39] the entire topic what are the main ideas
[00:03:42] and how do those main ideas fit together
[00:03:46] in the big picture and spending time to
[00:03:48] deliberately create this logic layer is
[00:03:50] crucial for efficient learning because
[00:03:51] it helps you build context about what
[00:03:55] you are going to learn and it doesn't
[00:03:57] take very long to develop this logic
[00:03:58] layer for a one to 2our topic it might
[00:04:01] only take you 10 15 minutes but it is a
[00:04:03] step that most students skip without
[00:04:06] even realizing it and this happens
[00:04:08] because most students believe that
[00:04:11] context is something that they will just
[00:04:14] develop as they keep studying it they
[00:04:16] think okay I've studied this now and I
[00:04:18] don't really know how to apply the
[00:04:20] information but I'm sure that if I keep
[00:04:22] studying it and then I do more practice
[00:04:24] papers and more flashcards I'll
[00:04:26] eventually get to a point where it's all
[00:04:28] connected together but this is not not
[00:04:30] true just time passing does not mean the
[00:04:33] ideas connect together the act of
[00:04:36] connecting information together
[00:04:39] developing context is an active process
[00:04:42] we need to engage in and in fact when we
[00:04:45] don't actively try to connect it
[00:04:48] together build the context and develop a
[00:04:51] big picture understanding first that's
[00:04:54] when we run into the issue of the more
[00:04:57] we learn the more overwhelming we get
[00:05:00] because now we're just loading up our
[00:05:02] brain with all these bits of information
[00:05:04] where we don't know what to do with it
[00:05:06] we don't know where it sits but somehow
[00:05:09] we're expecting our brain to organize it
[00:05:12] process it hold on to it and extract
[00:05:14] meaning out of it learning and taking in
[00:05:17] information when you don't have the
[00:05:19] context and the big picture is kind of
[00:05:22] like walking into a library but then all
[00:05:25] the books are just scattered all over
[00:05:27] the floor without any bookshelves to
[00:05:29] clearly organize the information so if
[00:05:32] you've ever studied something and you've
[00:05:33] tried to solve a problem but then you
[00:05:35] feel like hm I kind of recognize some of
[00:05:39] the concepts that might be relevant to
[00:05:41] helping me solve this but you can't
[00:05:43] actually solve it and connect it
[00:05:45] together and use what you have studied
[00:05:47] in that way then it means that you
[00:05:49] probably didn't actively make the step
[00:05:51] of bringing it together in layer one of
[00:05:55] learning and naturally that is a very
[00:05:57] frustrating and annoying and stressful
[00:06:00] process if that is happening to you
[00:06:02] constantly while you study but again
[00:06:04] this can be entirely avoided by doing
[00:06:07] layer one properly here are my Pro tips
[00:06:11] for doing layer one the right way first
[00:06:13] of all do it UPF front don't try to like
[00:06:17] I said develop context after you've
[00:06:19] taken in a huge mass of information and
[00:06:22] the easiest way to do that is step two
[00:06:24] list out your keywords take a textbook
[00:06:26] take whatever you're learning and then
[00:06:27] just skim through it and collect SCT the
[00:06:30] main key words and concepts for that
[00:06:32] topic these could be the titles and
[00:06:34] subheadings they could be bolded words
[00:06:36] and new terminology could be from your
[00:06:38] lecture objectives and by doing this it
[00:06:40] just creates a nice clean list of things
[00:06:42] for you to look through you're not
[00:06:44] having to just constantly be flicking
[00:06:46] back and forth between all your
[00:06:48] resources trying to figure out what
[00:06:50] exactly is foundational logic layer
[00:06:53] stuff and then what you do tip number
[00:06:55] three is look through this list that
[00:06:57] you've got and then start grouping it
[00:06:59] together think about what are the main
[00:07:02] similarities what are the main ways that
[00:07:05] I might be able to organize all of these
[00:07:07] different keywords and Concepts there
[00:07:09] are going to be similar Trends similar
[00:07:11] purposes similar parts of a process
[00:07:13] similar reasons for why it's important
[00:07:16] enough for you to learn them think about
[00:07:18] those things and start creating groups
[00:07:20] and relating these groups to each other
[00:07:23] and tip number four keep it simple you
[00:07:25] just need to have a very general surface
[00:07:28] level simp simple understanding of the
[00:07:31] overall topic something that you could
[00:07:34] explain to a 10-year-old and so by the
[00:07:36] end of layer one you should be able to
[00:07:39] generally explain what this topic is
[00:07:42] talking about you can say this topic is
[00:07:45] about these main types of ideas and they
[00:07:50] are important because they influence and
[00:07:52] relate to each other in this way you
[00:07:54] won't be able to explain any of those
[00:07:56] Concepts in detail you won't really
[00:07:59] remember all the little subconcepts and
[00:08:01] terminology that fits within that you're
[00:08:03] not going to be able to recite anything
[00:08:05] from memory necessarily but in the later
[00:08:08] layers when you go to learn that level
[00:08:11] of detail you will be able to understand
[00:08:13] where it fits in the big picture and
[00:08:16] you'll have ideas on why it's important
[00:08:18] and relevant to learn so this process of
[00:08:21] making it a bit more specific and adding
[00:08:23] on extra detail onto that first layer
[00:08:27] the logic layer is Layer Two and Layer
[00:08:30] Two is called the concepts layer this is
[00:08:33] where we're taking those big groups of
[00:08:36] ideas and we're actually splitting them
[00:08:37] out into the more specific major
[00:08:40] Concepts within them and Layer Two is
[00:08:43] important because this is what gives
[00:08:44] that topic depth it's what gives it more
[00:08:47] substance it makes it a little bit more
[00:08:48] specific during Layer Two we're
[00:08:51] developing the ability to actually
[00:08:54] explain things in detail and we should
[00:08:56] be able to answer a lot of those
[00:08:58] questions that might come up in an exam
[00:09:00] and because in layer one we generally
[00:09:02] figured out how these big Ideas relate
[00:09:05] with each other it means that when we
[00:09:07] come to a more complicated problem which
[00:09:09] requires us to connect different
[00:09:12] concepts from different parts of the
[00:09:14] topic and use them together we know how
[00:09:17] they connect and we can actually do that
[00:09:19] now Layer Two is where we need to spend
[00:09:22] the majority of our studying time around
[00:09:25] 60 to 70% of all the time we spend
[00:09:28] studying a topic should be spent in
[00:09:30] Layer Two if we want to get top results
[00:09:33] however there is something that holds a
[00:09:35] lot of students back from being able to
[00:09:37] do this correctly which I will talk
[00:09:38] about later in the video but right now I
[00:09:40] want to make it clear that this entire
[00:09:43] process especially during layer 2 where
[00:09:45] we are adding on those extra details and
[00:09:48] our big picture understanding is
[00:09:50] starting to get more and more accurate
[00:09:52] and more specific this is something that
[00:09:55] takes time for me if I'm learning a
[00:09:57] large topic this can take me multip
[00:09:59] study sessions across multiple days and
[00:10:02] if you've never tried learning in this
[00:10:04] way before it can feel very confusing
[00:10:08] and even quite frustrating sometimes
[00:10:10] just knowing whether you're doing it
[00:10:12] right or wrong but just like for
[00:10:13] learning any new skill those feelings
[00:10:16] are completely normal and expected as
[00:10:19] part of just improving your skills and
[00:10:22] I'll mention here as well that as an
[00:10:24] extra resource I also have a free Weekly
[00:10:27] Newsletter where I go through through
[00:10:29] more evidence-based tips and strategies
[00:10:32] that can help you work through this
[00:10:34] process I talk about this layers of
[00:10:36] learning a little bit more detail with a
[00:10:37] few more examples as well and I also
[00:10:39] talk about a lot of other strategies as
[00:10:41] well that can help you get top results
[00:10:43] so if that's something that's
[00:10:44] interesting for you I'll leave a link in
[00:10:45] the description again it's totally free
[00:10:47] now at this point of our layers once
[00:10:49] we've done layer one the logic and Layer
[00:10:51] Two the concepts we have a generally
[00:10:55] pretty good understanding of the topic
[00:10:57] we see how it fits together we can talk
[00:11:00] about the big picture of things why what
[00:11:02] we are learning is important how we can
[00:11:04] use it you can see how the ideas are
[00:11:06] connected together and you can explain
[00:11:08] these Concepts in pretty good detail as
[00:11:11] well so what we're missing at this point
[00:11:13] are those really specific details these
[00:11:17] could be like very particular pieces of
[00:11:19] terminology or the name of particular
[00:11:22] Catalyst and molecules or uh particular
[00:11:25] types of dates or locations that an
[00:11:27] event happened these are the very fine
[00:11:29] granular details you might get tested on
[00:11:32] or you need to use it as part of your
[00:11:34] essay or writing and this is where layer
[00:11:37] three comes in layer 3 is what we call
[00:11:40] important
[00:11:42] details and the reason it's called an
[00:11:44] important detail is because these are
[00:11:48] the specific pieces of information the
[00:11:50] details that are important for helping
[00:11:54] us to understand layer 2 and this is
[00:11:58] actually really important because it's
[00:11:59] saying that this very specific piece of
[00:12:02] information that when you first look at
[00:12:04] it you might think that's just something
[00:12:06] I need a wrote memorize is something
[00:12:08] that is actually connected is related to
[00:12:12] a concept that you've learned there is a
[00:12:15] reason for you to learn that detail
[00:12:18] which means from your brain's
[00:12:21] perspective there is a place for it to
[00:12:23] fit there is a way it can organize it in
[00:12:26] relation to everything else you've been
[00:12:28] learning so figuring out what is in
[00:12:30] layer three is actually kind of simple
[00:12:34] all we have to do is look at that piece
[00:12:36] of information and ask ourselves does
[00:12:38] this help me understand something from
[00:12:41] Layer Two or make something from layer
[00:12:44] two more concrete and if the answer is
[00:12:47] yes then it fits into layer three if the
[00:12:50] answer is no then we'll talk about that
[00:12:51] in the next layer but even though it's
[00:12:54] technically very straightforward to
[00:12:55] figure out what is in layer three here
[00:12:57] is the issue the reason so many students
[00:13:01] feel overwhelmed with learning
[00:13:03] especially for big topics and the more
[00:13:04] they learn the more overwhelmed they get
[00:13:06] is that they jump into layer three
[00:13:09] without having done layer 1 and Layer
[00:13:13] Two first and that is actually
[00:13:16] disastrous and as soon as you've done
[00:13:18] that you can say goodbye to your
[00:13:19] efficiency because think about this when
[00:13:22] you ask yourself this detail is this
[00:13:25] important for me by helping me to
[00:13:28] understand the concept or making it more
[00:13:29] concrete how can you know the answer to
[00:13:32] that if you haven't actually figured out
[00:13:35] the concepts in the first place and how
[00:13:39] do you know whether it's going to be
[00:13:41] important if you don't know how you're
[00:13:44] going to use those Concepts which is
[00:13:47] something we figure out during logic
[00:13:48] layer layer one spoiler alert the answer
[00:13:50] is that you can't so when you start with
[00:13:53] just layer three just ramming through
[00:13:56] all the details as much as we can like
[00:13:59] there's so much to learn I better just
[00:14:00] go through trying to memorize absolutely
[00:14:02] everything from start to finish then
[00:14:04] everything becomes irrelevant because
[00:14:08] there is nothing to connect it to and we
[00:14:11] end up with a disorganized mass of
[00:14:15] disconnected isolated facts and and
[00:14:18] individual Concepts and explanations and
[00:14:20] processes which means our retention is
[00:14:22] not going to be very good and our
[00:14:23] understanding is not going to be very
[00:14:24] deep and we can't use the knowledge the
[00:14:26] way that we need to and we have to
[00:14:28] compensate by just trying to memorize
[00:14:30] all of that more like just doing more
[00:14:33] repetition more flash card spending more
[00:14:35] time studying and the key to avoiding
[00:14:38] that and making it so that learning does
[00:14:41] get easier the more you learn and you're
[00:14:43] not getting overwhelmed and falling into
[00:14:45] a trap of endless repetitive
[00:14:47] memorization is to understand that
[00:14:51] learning in the right order makes
[00:14:54] learning build on itself ler three is
[00:14:57] the perfect example of this because when
[00:15:00] you first go through a textbook on a
[00:15:02] topic you've never studied before
[00:15:03] everything is very detailed Everything
[00:15:05] feels very specific like there's no
[00:15:07] other way for you to learn it other than
[00:15:09] memorizing and maybe that's what
[00:15:10] everyone else is doing but you know just
[00:15:12] because everyone is doing it doesn't
[00:15:14] mean it's good but common and widespread
[00:15:16] does not mean desirable uh after all you
[00:15:19] know Co was also pretty widespread but
[00:15:22] there are lots of detailed specific
[00:15:25] pieces of information that become
[00:15:28] relevant become logical become intuitive
[00:15:31] and easy to understand and remember when
[00:15:34] you know a little bit more about the
[00:15:36] topic and that fact that seemed
[00:15:38] irrelevant and detailed and the only way
[00:15:40] you could learn it was memorization now
[00:15:42] when we look at it we think oh yeah that
[00:15:45] makes sense I can see how that fits in
[00:15:48] you can only get to that feeling by
[00:15:50] learning the layers in the right order
[00:15:52] so let's say we have gone through layer
[00:15:54] one then Layer Two and now we're at
[00:15:55] layer three we've identified which
[00:15:57] details seem to be important important
[00:15:59] for Layer Two which things make that
[00:16:01] concept more concrete what do we do with
[00:16:03] that well first of all we can add them
[00:16:05] into our notes if you're using mind
[00:16:06] mapping then you can add them into your
[00:16:08] mind map and we can also add those into
[00:16:10] something like flash cards flash cards
[00:16:12] are great for helping us remember those
[00:16:14] detailed specific pieces of information
[00:16:16] and so we're covering both of our bases
[00:16:18] we're making sure that we're not going
[00:16:20] to forget those details we're
[00:16:21] documenting them we're using flash cards
[00:16:24] which gives us the benefit of pretty
[00:16:25] decent queued recoil and space
[00:16:27] repetition but but we're also making
[00:16:30] sure we know how to use that information
[00:16:32] in the right way by connecting it
[00:16:35] through something like a mind matat and
[00:16:36] so while I will say that flash cards are
[00:16:38] a great tool to use during this layer
[00:16:41] layer three they are a very ineffective
[00:16:44] way of trying to learn the bottom two
[00:16:46] layers and so by the end of layer three
[00:16:49] we have a big picture understanding of
[00:16:52] how things are connected to each other
[00:16:53] with specific Concepts and we also have
[00:16:57] specific details that make those
[00:16:59] Concepts more concrete at this point we
[00:17:01] are 80 90% on our tests and exams or
[00:17:05] more so what could possibly be left well
[00:17:08] what's left is layer four and layer four
[00:17:12] is a major source of confusion and
[00:17:15] overwhelm for a lot of students and
[00:17:17] that's because layer four is what I call
[00:17:20] arbitrary details and arbitrary details
[00:17:24] are the types of details that are just
[00:17:27] not important they don't help you to
[00:17:29] understand a concept they don't seem to
[00:17:31] fit into the big picture anywhere it's
[00:17:33] kind of like there's no reason to really
[00:17:36] learn this if you are not going to get
[00:17:38] tested on it it's basically just all the
[00:17:40] stuff that's left over after you've done
[00:17:43] layer 1 2 and three but here's the
[00:17:45] reason why layer four is the thing that
[00:17:48] trips up so many students is that you
[00:17:51] can only figure out what is layer 4 what
[00:17:54] is an arbitrary detail if you've already
[00:17:58] figured out out what is layer three in
[00:18:01] important detail you can only figure out
[00:18:02] what's important if you've done Layer
[00:18:04] Two which is the concepts and you can
[00:18:06] only figure out the concepts if you know
[00:18:07] where they fit which is layer one the
[00:18:09] logic and so at the start of this video
[00:18:10] I said that the reason why a lot of
[00:18:13] people struggle and get overwhelmed with
[00:18:15] learning is because they're not learning
[00:18:17] in this order they're learning in the
[00:18:19] opposite order this is exactly what I'm
[00:18:22] talking about this is the major trap you
[00:18:25] need to avoid if you want to be more
[00:18:27] efficient and get the results that you
[00:18:28] looking for when you open up a textbook
[00:18:30] the information as it's given to you
[00:18:34] biases you into starting at layer 4 and
[00:18:39] that's because when we open up a
[00:18:41] textbook the majority of that
[00:18:43] information is very detailed it's in
[00:18:46] this layer three or layer 4 and because
[00:18:49] we feel like there's so much we have to
[00:18:50] learn we get on with it we spend that
[00:18:54] time trying to get through all of these
[00:18:56] details to remember and understand every
[00:18:59] single detail but remember if we start
[00:19:01] this way we don't know what's important
[00:19:04] we don't have context we don't know how
[00:19:05] we're going to use that information we
[00:19:07] don't know where it fits and so now our
[00:19:08] brain is trying to do multiple things
[00:19:10] it's trying to not only understand what
[00:19:12] you're reading and just comprehend it
[00:19:14] it's trying not only to just desperately
[00:19:16] hold on to and remember that information
[00:19:19] and it's also trying to figure out why
[00:19:21] the heck it needs to hold on to that
[00:19:23] information in the first place why is it
[00:19:26] relevant where does it fit how does it
[00:19:28] relate to anything else and we spend
[00:19:30] hours and hours just churning through
[00:19:34] inside this detail layer over enough
[00:19:37] time we can get a sense for oh some of
[00:19:41] these things seem to be a little bit
[00:19:43] more important and so the layer three
[00:19:46] important details become a little
[00:19:47] clearer and then as we see these
[00:19:49] important details we start thinking hold
[00:19:51] on a second maybe these are related to
[00:19:54] this particular concept and those
[00:19:55] Concepts become clearer and we start to
[00:19:57] be able to understand in more depth and
[00:19:59] then eventually maybe if we have enough
[00:20:03] time to do enough practice questions and
[00:20:05] test ourselves we might see how they all
[00:20:07] connect together and get that light bulb
[00:20:09] moment of understanding the purpose of
[00:20:13] why we were learning everything and how
[00:20:15] to actually use it and that is when we
[00:20:18] reach layer one and sometimes we never
[00:20:21] reach that because we run out of time so
[00:20:23] then the question is how do we avoid
[00:20:26] that experience and how do we learn in
[00:20:28] the right layers in the first place if
[00:20:30] we're hid in the face with so many of
[00:20:33] these details to sift through well the
[00:20:35] solution is to actively filter the
[00:20:38] information in these four layers to
[00:20:41] begin with so if you have a single page
[00:20:44] on a textbook you're no longer going to
[00:20:46] look at it as one page of information
[00:20:49] you're going to see that that page has
[00:20:51] four layers of information it becomes a
[00:20:55] process of skimming the information to
[00:20:58] to deliberately look for the things that
[00:21:02] for you feel like it belongs in layer
[00:21:05] one and focusing our attention on just
[00:21:08] the layer one information and once we've
[00:21:10] gone through our material defined all
[00:21:12] the layer one information and built our
[00:21:14] lay one with a strong Foundation we're
[00:21:16] going to go through all the stuff again
[00:21:18] a second time this time filtering and
[00:21:21] looking for the things that feel like
[00:21:23] Layer Two and remember Layer Two takes
[00:21:25] the longest and once we've done that we
[00:21:26] can go through it again to filter out
[00:21:29] the things that are layer three or layer
[00:21:31] four and you usually you can do those
[00:21:33] last two layers in the same step and if
[00:21:35] you are in the unfortunate position
[00:21:36] where you do need to actually learn
[00:21:37] these layer four things as well that's
[00:21:40] also when you might just put them into
[00:21:42] some flash cards but on top of doing
[00:21:44] this you also need to be able to detect
[00:21:47] when you're doing it in the wrong order
[00:21:49] and one of the telltale signs red flags
[00:21:53] that you're going in the wrong order is
[00:21:55] that you are very early on in your
[00:21:57] studying Pro ESS and already you are
[00:22:01] making flash cards or you are in your
[00:22:04] mind just trying to remember and hold on
[00:22:06] to what you're learning that's your
[00:22:09] mindset and that's what you're doing
[00:22:10] that's a very clear sign that you're
[00:22:12] focusing on the wrong layer and if you
[00:22:13] do want to be a top learner or even if
[00:22:16] you just want to make learning a little
[00:22:18] bit easier than it is now I can promise
[00:22:21] you I can guarantee it if you start
[00:22:23] thinking of learning in layers you will
[00:22:26] find that you are more efficient you
[00:22:28] your memory gets better your
[00:22:30] understanding is deeper you're getting
[00:22:31] better results and you'll start feeling
[00:22:33] more confident in the way that you learn
[00:22:35] so if you want more specific strategies
[00:22:37] and tips on how to navigate these four
[00:22:39] layers then remember my free Weekly
[00:22:40] Newsletter the links in the description
[00:22:42] and if you want to learn even more
[00:22:44] learning strategies and techniques then
[00:22:47] I recommend checking out this video here

=== How to Become an Expert in ANYTHING FAST - The Dunning Kruger Effect ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXSNfuUilio

[00:00:00] in this video I'll teach you how to
[00:00:01] become an expert in any field or subject
[00:00:05] that you want doesn't matter if your
[00:00:06] goal is to get high grades or learn a
[00:00:08] new language or play the piano if you
[00:00:10] want to become an expert you have to go
[00:00:12] through something called the Dunning
[00:00:14] Krueger effect and it's named after the
[00:00:16] researchers Dunning and krugger who
[00:00:18] published This research now the Dunning
[00:00:19] krugger effect can be broken down into
[00:00:21] three distinct stages and the reason
[00:00:23] most people don't achieve their goals is
[00:00:25] because they get stuck in the first two
[00:00:28] stages which leads to a lot of stress
[00:00:30] and frustration and disappointment but
[00:00:32] by the end of this video you'll
[00:00:33] understand all three stages of the
[00:00:35] Dunning Krueger effect so you can work
[00:00:37] out which stage you're on and more
[00:00:39] importantly how you can successfully
[00:00:41] progress to the next stage so let's
[00:00:43] start with the first stage called the
[00:00:45] climb to Mount stupid and this stage is
[00:00:49] by far the most dangerous stage if you
[00:00:52] look at all the people who failed to
[00:00:55] achieve their goals most people failed
[00:00:58] because they couldn't move past this
[00:01:01] first stage so I'm going to spend some
[00:01:03] time to help you understand why this
[00:01:06] stage is so dangerous and how you can
[00:01:09] push yourself through it and the easiest
[00:01:11] way to understand the stage and why it's
[00:01:12] so dangerous is using something called
[00:01:13] the Dunning Krueger graph so all three
[00:01:16] stages of the Dunning Krueger effect are
[00:01:17] defined by the same two variables
[00:01:20] confidence and skill confidence refers
[00:01:22] to how confident you feel in your level
[00:01:25] of skill or expertise this is purely
[00:01:28] subjective on the other hand skill is
[00:01:30] how good you actually are at something
[00:01:33] and this is objective you can actually
[00:01:35] perform and get results that show it so
[00:01:38] let's say to achieve our Dream goal like
[00:01:40] getting top grades and then entering
[00:01:42] into our Dream career pathway we need to
[00:01:45] have a level of skill that's somewhere
[00:01:47] around here but when we're First
[00:01:49] Learning and trying to improve our
[00:01:50] skills to to reach this goal we're in
[00:01:53] the first stage of the Dunning Krueger
[00:01:56] and so our skill level is all the way
[00:01:58] over here and so what happen in this
[00:02:00] stage one is that our skill goes up by a
[00:02:03] small amount but our confidence shoots
[00:02:06] up rapidly so we call this the climb to
[00:02:09] Mount stupid because we're very
[00:02:12] confident without being very skilled and
[00:02:15] the peak of Mount stupid is right here
[00:02:17] and by the way I don't know who made
[00:02:18] these names but they are absolutely
[00:02:20] Savage and so obviously being in stage
[00:02:22] one the climb to Mount stupid is a very
[00:02:24] dangerous place to be if you want to
[00:02:25] achieve your goals because you
[00:02:28] definitely do not have the skills
[00:02:30] necessary to achieve your goal but you
[00:02:32] believe you do you are way overconfident
[00:02:36] we essentially don't know enough to
[00:02:38] realize how much we don't know and I see
[00:02:41] this all the time in learning skills and
[00:02:45] learning to learn where someone watch a
[00:02:46] few videos or read some articles about
[00:02:48] using flash cards or active recall and
[00:02:50] then they have Supreme confidence like
[00:02:53] they think they've got learning
[00:02:54] completely figured out even if in some
[00:02:57] cases they're still not actually that
[00:03:00] successful yet but here is the dangerous
[00:03:02] part about stage one and being on Mount
[00:03:04] stupid that you need to understand it's
[00:03:06] not just a fact that you become
[00:03:08] overconfident the problem and the danger
[00:03:12] is that most people will get to this
[00:03:15] point the peak of Mount stupid and they
[00:03:18] just stay there they stay unskilled and
[00:03:24] overconfident but why why do so many
[00:03:26] people get stuck here well it's because
[00:03:28] of something that researchers for the
[00:03:30] Dual burden of incompetence the Dual
[00:03:33] burden of incompetence means that you
[00:03:35] don't have the skills to achieve your
[00:03:37] goals but you also don't know that you
[00:03:41] don't have the skills to achieve your
[00:03:43] goals and what that means is that your
[00:03:45] skills stop improving at stage one after
[00:03:49] all if you are really confident in
[00:03:51] something then you have less motivation
[00:03:53] and you're not as open-minded to learn
[00:03:55] more about it so the question is how do
[00:03:58] we move past stage want because
[00:04:00] obviously we need to get our skills all
[00:04:02] the way through to there to achieve our
[00:04:03] goals well the first way is what happens
[00:04:05] to most people which is that you stay
[00:04:08] overconfident and then you continue to
[00:04:10] fail and you fail and fail and fail so
[00:04:12] many times that you realize surely you
[00:04:15] must be missing something and your
[00:04:17] confidence is forcibly cracked open or
[00:04:20] there is a less traumatic way of
[00:04:23] achieving this and that's with a
[00:04:25] technique called a
[00:04:27] premortem analysis and using a premortem
[00:04:30] analysis can help you to move past stage
[00:04:32] one without needing to repeatedly fail
[00:04:34] so what is a premortem well a postmortem
[00:04:36] in medicine is an examination that
[00:04:38] doctors do on someone that's deceased to
[00:04:40] examine the body and figure out the
[00:04:42] cause of death a premortem analysis is
[00:04:45] where you assume something terrible has
[00:04:49] happened and then you ask yourself why
[00:04:52] it happened the technique that was
[00:04:54] created by a cognitive psychologist
[00:04:56] called Gary Klein and published in the
[00:04:58] Harvard Business Review in 2007 and has
[00:05:00] since been used all over the world and
[00:05:03] by assuming that a disastrous outcome
[00:05:07] has happened and then writing down all
[00:05:09] the reasons that may have happened it
[00:05:12] forces us to challenge our assumptions
[00:05:14] and challenge our beliefs it takes
[00:05:16] confidence out of the picture sure
[00:05:18] you're feeling confident about your
[00:05:19] study skills and you think you're going
[00:05:20] to do well on this exam let's just say
[00:05:22] that you didn't do well why might that
[00:05:25] be and often when we're on Mount stupid
[00:05:28] and we do a pre-mortem analysis
[00:05:30] it's very difficult to even think about
[00:05:33] why we might have failed this is
[00:05:35] actually a good thing because it forces
[00:05:38] you to then have questions that you
[00:05:41] explore for example if all you're doing
[00:05:43] is like active record flash cards and
[00:05:45] then you don't do so well and then you
[00:05:46] think about why then you now need to
[00:05:49] learn okay well when do flash cards not
[00:05:52] work so well in what situations are they
[00:05:55] helpful or in what situations are they
[00:05:56] actually harmful what other strategies
[00:05:59] might I need that I haven't been
[00:06:01] thinking about that I need to actually
[00:06:02] succeed what are the other barriers that
[00:06:04] are in place that I might not be
[00:06:05] thinking about an expert that really
[00:06:07] knows this stuff can answer those
[00:06:09] questions but by exposing that gap of
[00:06:12] knowledge and by asking and answering
[00:06:14] these questions our skill and knowledge
[00:06:17] slowly grows this process is by no means
[00:06:21] quick or easy for me when it comes to
[00:06:23] learning to learn I made a lot of very
[00:06:26] heavy mistakes trying to move through
[00:06:29] mount ST which I really want you to
[00:06:31] avoid which is why I created a free
[00:06:34] Weekly Newsletter where I share tips and
[00:06:37] advice to help you grow in less time
[00:06:40] than it took me again it's completely
[00:06:42] free so if You' like to sign up I'll
[00:06:43] leave a link for you in the description
[00:06:45] now as our skills and knowledge
[00:06:48] eventually grow we move through into
[00:06:51] stage two of the Dunning kru gr effect
[00:06:53] and stage two is where we have better
[00:06:56] skills life is good problems are solved
[00:06:59] we're feeling happy now just kidding uh
[00:07:01] stage two is probably where you're going
[00:07:03] to lose all hope in fact stage two is
[00:07:06] actually called the valley of
[00:07:10] Despair so yes you you fall off Mount
[00:07:14] stupid into the valley of Despair Savage
[00:07:18] names I know and so the valley of
[00:07:20] Despair is where we're becoming
[00:07:22] painfully aware of the gaps in our
[00:07:25] knowledge and so as a result our
[00:07:27] confidence plummets but this is actually
[00:07:29] a great sign because it means that we've
[00:07:31] moved past the most dangerous point of
[00:07:34] the Dunning Krueger effect which is the
[00:07:35] client to mount stupid and even though
[00:07:37] it doesn't feel like it our skills are
[00:07:40] actually better than they were before so
[00:07:42] the danger here in the value of Despair
[00:07:45] is just not understanding this and then
[00:07:48] giving up which is the saddest part and
[00:07:51] it happens to a lot of people they start
[00:07:53] thinking I've been studying and working
[00:07:55] on this thing so much for so long how do
[00:07:59] I still suck so much and in my
[00:08:02] experience this happens a lot to people
[00:08:03] that are halfway through their phds but
[00:08:06] if you are set on achieving that Big
[00:08:09] Goal then you do have to push through
[00:08:12] that dip and confidence the question now
[00:08:15] is if you're feeling unconfident how do
[00:08:18] you know that you're in the value of
[00:08:20] Despair or if you genuinely just like
[00:08:24] are not very skilled at something well
[00:08:26] this is actually very easy there are two
[00:08:28] signs first of all is the time spent if
[00:08:31] you're in the Valley of the spare you
[00:08:32] probably spent at least a moderate
[00:08:34] amount of time immersing yourself in
[00:08:37] this studying and working on it this is
[00:08:39] usually in the span of months or even
[00:08:42] years now the one exception to this is
[00:08:45] if you've received a lot of coaching for
[00:08:47] example in my learning skills program
[00:08:48] people often reach stage two in roughly
[00:08:51] one or two weeks and that's because
[00:08:54] they're actively finding the mistakes
[00:08:56] and weaknesses much more quickly than
[00:08:58] they normally would in
[00:09:00] natural life it's the same for sports
[00:09:02] coaching as well when you've got someone
[00:09:03] that's watching you and actively
[00:09:05] pointing out the mistakes you will
[00:09:07] progress and learn about where your gaps
[00:09:11] are 10 to 20 times faster than just
[00:09:13] figuring it out yourself and the second
[00:09:15] sign is your actual confidence or rather
[00:09:18] the trend in your confidence if you're
[00:09:20] in the value of Despair you will
[00:09:22] probably remember having felt much more
[00:09:26] confident about this before and that as
[00:09:28] you learned more and got deeper into it
[00:09:31] you felt that your confidence came down
[00:09:34] so if you take those two boxes and you
[00:09:36] are in the value of Despair what I want
[00:09:38] to say to you is keep going you are
[00:09:41] doing well you're on the right track I
[00:09:44] personally when it comes to learning to
[00:09:46] learn spent years in the valley it took
[00:09:49] me years to overcome the mount stupid
[00:09:52] and get to the valley and then I spent
[00:09:53] years in that what you are feeling now
[00:09:57] is a part of the the Journey of becoming
[00:10:00] an expert and right now you may think
[00:10:03] that there are so many gaps in your
[00:10:05] skill and knowledge but remember once
[00:10:08] upon a time you didn't even know enough
[00:10:11] to think of those gaps and if you want
[00:10:13] to keep pushing through this stage you
[00:10:16] have to keep learning and what better
[00:10:17] way to keep learning than with this
[00:10:19] video sponsor short form short form
[00:10:21] gives you books summaries and guides on
[00:10:24] thousands of the most popular books they
[00:10:26] have chapter by chapter analyses which a
[00:10:29] lot of other apps have but the real
[00:10:31] power comes in their commentary and
[00:10:33] Analysis section this is where they
[00:10:35] actually take the concepts from that
[00:10:37] chapter or from that book and then they
[00:10:39] compare it with other similar books in
[00:10:42] that field or even just wider research
[00:10:44] and as someone that usually knows the
[00:10:48] research like when I read a
[00:10:49] self-development book I know the
[00:10:50] research is based on I'm genuinely
[00:10:53] impressed at how they're able to connect
[00:10:56] all those things together it'll even
[00:10:58] tell you if there's a concept in book
[00:10:59] that disagrees with the wider research
[00:11:02] so that you can be more skeptical about
[00:11:03] it it saves a lot of time and it helps
[00:11:05] you keep an open mind while you're
[00:11:06] navigating through Mount stupid I've
[00:11:08] been reading how to change by Katie
[00:11:11] Milkman which is a book on how to use
[00:11:13] evidence-based psychology to create
[00:11:14] positive behavioral change and it's
[00:11:17] already given me a lot of new things to
[00:11:19] think about if you want to give it a go
[00:11:20] yourself you can use my link short.com
[00:11:23] Justin sun and will give you an
[00:11:25] unlimited free trial on thousands of
[00:11:28] books as well as a 20% extra discount on
[00:11:32] an annual subscription the links in my
[00:11:33] description if you want to sign up now
[00:11:35] once you push through stage two you
[00:11:37] enter the third and final stage which is
[00:11:40] called the slope of
[00:11:43] Enlightenment and in this stage
[00:11:46] congratulations you can finally say that
[00:11:48] you are an expert this is when we have
[00:11:51] that growing level of confidence but we
[00:11:54] also have that level of skill and for
[00:11:56] complex skills including learning to
[00:11:58] learn it takes years and years to get to
[00:12:02] this stage and if right now you are all
[00:12:05] the way back here then you probably
[00:12:09] don't even need to get all the way to
[00:12:12] the end to achieve your next goal like
[00:12:14] you don't need to be a a Nobel winning
[00:12:18] physicist to do well in your next
[00:12:20] Physics Exam fact actually just smash
[00:12:22] your next immediate goal you might only
[00:12:25] need to increase your skills to
[00:12:27] somewhere around here but if ultimate
[00:12:29] goal is challenging like living your
[00:12:33] dream career then you will eventually
[00:12:36] with time need to move through all three
[00:12:39] of these stages and what's important is
[00:12:41] not just getting to stage three as
[00:12:43] quickly as possible what's important is
[00:12:45] progressing through the stages without
[00:12:47] getting stuck and without giving up FYI
[00:12:50] for me I've spent now over 11 years
[00:12:53] reading learning science research and
[00:12:56] coaching tens of thousands of people
[00:12:59] people and really dedicating my life to
[00:13:02] becoming the best learning coach I can
[00:13:04] be and I will probably put myself
[00:13:06] somewhere around here at the moment it's
[00:13:09] probably like another 10 years before I
[00:13:11] get to somewhere like here but I do have
[00:13:14] to mention something about these stages
[00:13:17] of the Dunning Krueger effect and it's a
[00:13:20] little controversial which is that some
[00:13:23] people will say that everything that
[00:13:25] I've talked about in this video the
[00:13:27] Dunning Krueger effect the graph all the
[00:13:28] stages is uh that it's not real they say
[00:13:31] that the Dunning Krueger effect it
[00:13:33] doesn't exist why do they say that well
[00:13:36] they say it's because the original
[00:13:38] research by Dunning and Krueger in
[00:13:40] 1999 doesn't show this graph and I have
[00:13:46] a
[00:13:47] confession they're right kind of the
[00:13:50] original research from 1999 does not
[00:13:53] show a graph that looks like this in
[00:13:55] fact the original research has a graph
[00:13:56] that looks a little bit more like this
[00:13:59] and no one actually knows where this
[00:14:02] graph that's so popular now came from or
[00:14:05] who gave these Savage names but
[00:14:07] ironically I think that the people who
[00:14:11] make all these videos saying that the
[00:14:13] dny Krueger effect isn't real might be
[00:14:17] on Mount stupid about the Dunning
[00:14:21] Krueger effect cuz if you go and read
[00:14:24] even more at the dozens or even hundreds
[00:14:28] of studies that were conducted in the
[00:14:29] last 25 years since the original paper
[00:14:32] was published which I have read a lot of
[00:14:35] you'll see that this stunning krugger
[00:14:38] relationship where people overestimate
[00:14:40] their confidence and aren't very good at
[00:14:43] assessing their real levels of skill has
[00:14:45] been found repeatedly in multiple
[00:14:48] studies especially when it comes to
[00:14:50] learning to learn and so while I admit
[00:14:52] that this graph and some of the things
[00:14:54] that I talked about have been simplified
[00:14:56] for social media the concepts and and
[00:14:59] the stages are things that have been
[00:15:02] backed by a huge body of research over
[00:15:05] the years FYI the research is pretty
[00:15:06] complicated so if you want me to go into
[00:15:08] it in more detail let me know in the
[00:15:09] comments but if what matters to you is
[00:15:11] achieving your goals and building your
[00:15:14] skills then it is also practically safer
[00:15:18] for you to believe that the Dunning
[00:15:20] Krueger effect is real just in case you
[00:15:23] fall into an overconfidence trap because
[00:15:25] at the end of the day I want to with
[00:15:27] these videos help you to become a more
[00:15:29] confident learner but not an
[00:15:31] overconfident learner you need to see
[00:15:35] your gaps and mistakes to really achieve
[00:15:37] your goals so those are the three stages
[00:15:39] of becoming an expert and to help you on
[00:15:42] your journey here's another video that I
[00:15:44] recommend to help you keep progressing
[00:15:46] through the three stages of the Dunning
[00:15:48] Krueger effect


=== Watch This To Force Your Brain To Study FASTER ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz4JKqoG_Mc

[00:00:00] what's the easiest way to study more in
[00:00:03] less time I spent years trying to figure
[00:00:05] this out so that you don't have to in
[00:00:07] this video I'm going to show you exactly
[00:00:08] that by teaching you a game-changing
[00:00:10] concept I call the three cognitive
[00:00:13] pillars and having coached thousands of
[00:00:14] students I've noticed that once students
[00:00:16] master all three of these cognitive
[00:00:19] pillars they're able to study much more
[00:00:22] and much higher quality and in a shorter
[00:00:25] period of time which means ultimately
[00:00:27] they get much better results in order to
[00:00:29] master the three cognitive pillars we
[00:00:31] first need to understand why it's almost
[00:00:33] impossible for most students including
[00:00:36] probably you to study more in less time
[00:00:39] no matter how hard you try and that
[00:00:42] reason is that most students do not
[00:00:45] understand how the brain learns so
[00:00:47] here's the thing about learning it's a
[00:00:49] complicated process but if I break it
[00:00:51] down for you learning starts with
[00:00:53] information coming into our brains and
[00:00:56] the goal of studying is to turn this
[00:00:59] information into knowledge and knowledge
[00:01:03] is of course what we use for exams or
[00:01:06] for solving a problem at work or
[00:01:08] anything else so what does that actually
[00:01:09] mean to study more in less time well
[00:01:13] it's not just about getting more
[00:01:15] information in that's easy the
[00:01:17] bottleneck is how hard it is to turn
[00:01:21] that information into knowledge and the
[00:01:24] faster we can do that the more
[00:01:26] effectively we can study and the shorter
[00:01:28] the amount of time it takes but
[00:01:30] it's not as simple as that because
[00:01:32] knowledge can be further broken down
[00:01:34] into two parts the first is retention
[00:01:38] retention is how long we can hold on to
[00:01:41] our knowledge for if we learn something
[00:01:42] today and we can still remember it weeks
[00:01:45] later that's a sign of higher retention
[00:01:47] but there's a second often overlooked
[00:01:50] aspect which is arguably even more
[00:01:52] important which is Mastery and Mastery
[00:01:56] is the quality of that knowledge we're
[00:01:58] retaining so first example if you learn
[00:02:00] something but then you can only just
[00:02:01] recall facts and recite things word for
[00:02:04] word then your knowledge Mastery is
[00:02:08] pretty low it's quite superficial
[00:02:10] whereas if you're able to take
[00:02:12] information and connect it to other
[00:02:14] pieces of information see how it relates
[00:02:16] and then use them for complex problem
[00:02:18] solving then that indicates a higher
[00:02:20] quality or higher Mastery of knowledge
[00:02:23] now this is important because remember
[00:02:26] our Dream outcome is not just to study
[00:02:28] more and less time the reason we want to
[00:02:30] study more and less time in the first
[00:02:32] place is so that we can get better
[00:02:34] results and so the only way that you can
[00:02:36] study more and less time in a way that
[00:02:39] actually leads to better results is to
[00:02:42] turn information into knowledge in a way
[00:02:46] that maximizes our retention and our
[00:02:50] Mastery after all there's no point
[00:02:52] covering twice the amount of content if
[00:02:55] you forget half of it or you can't even
[00:02:57] use it in the way that you need to and
[00:02:58] so the real question is how do we we
[00:03:00] turn information into knowledge in a way
[00:03:03] that actually ticks both of these boxes
[00:03:05] and the most effective way to achieve
[00:03:07] this is something that researchers call
[00:03:10] Knowledge
[00:03:11] schemas the key to studying more and
[00:03:15] less time is being able to form
[00:03:18] knowledge schemas quickly and accurately
[00:03:21] so what are schemas a schema is
[00:03:23] basically a network of information when
[00:03:26] you build a strong schema of knowledge
[00:03:28] you're able to see how everything learn
[00:03:30] is connected together think of schemas
[00:03:32] like the way that a city might organize
[00:03:34] its public transport system you have
[00:03:36] this network of train stations and bus
[00:03:39] stations and all these different routes
[00:03:40] and paths that connect everything
[00:03:42] together and ultimately this transport
[00:03:44] Network lets you get from one location
[00:03:47] to another location in the case of
[00:03:49] learning each location represents a
[00:03:52] piece of information or a concept I
[00:03:54] often say that it makes your knowledge
[00:03:56] integrated rather than isolated and it's
[00:03:58] this
[00:04:00] integrated of knowledge that reflects
[00:04:03] the level of Mastery that we have the
[00:04:06] quality of our knowledge more integrated
[00:04:09] or connected knowledge usually means a
[00:04:12] higher level of Mastery which usually
[00:04:16] means you can use the knowledge for more
[00:04:19] complex application like solving harder
[00:04:23] or unconventional complex problems and
[00:04:25] so the research shows that when you're
[00:04:26] able to form these knowledge schemas
[00:04:29] correctly then it increases your
[00:04:31] retention and your Mastery and in fact
[00:04:33] the reason that top Learners are able to
[00:04:37] be top Learners is because when they see
[00:04:39] those complex problems they don't just
[00:04:41] see a problem they're actually able to
[00:04:43] pull it apart into each component
[00:04:45] concept they know where they need to
[00:04:47] start how they connect together and how
[00:04:49] they're going to approach solving that
[00:04:51] problem as opposed to someone with only
[00:04:54] a superficial level of Mastery where
[00:04:57] they may not even know which components
[00:04:59] and concepts are relevant or even if
[00:05:01] they do know they don't actually know
[00:05:04] how to connect them together so forming
[00:05:07] scheme is super important but now here's
[00:05:09] the problem forming schemas is hard and
[00:05:13] so most people either don't form these
[00:05:16] schemas or the schemas they form are of
[00:05:18] a very low quality which is exactly why
[00:05:20] most people struggle to study more and
[00:05:23] less time without sacrificing the
[00:05:25] quality of their knowledge but that's
[00:05:27] not all in fact it's actually even worse
[00:05:30] than that because when most people try
[00:05:32] to study more cover more content it
[00:05:34] actually makes them waste more time than
[00:05:37] before and that's because they're taking
[00:05:39] in more information but because they're
[00:05:41] not good at forming these knowledge
[00:05:43] schemas their attention of that
[00:05:46] information is very poor in fact it's
[00:05:48] going to be so poor that within just
[00:05:51] days or hours or sometimes even minutes
[00:05:54] after having learned it they already
[00:05:56] stting to forget and so now we need to
[00:05:58] spend extra time on just relearning the
[00:06:02] things that we forgot but when we
[00:06:04] relearn it we're using the same process
[00:06:07] that doesn't give us good knowledge
[00:06:09] schemas which creates the same poor
[00:06:11] retention which means we now have to
[00:06:13] spend even more time and it's just this
[00:06:15] inless cycle of relearning and if that
[00:06:17] wasn't bad enough even after doing all
[00:06:21] of this this constant repetition the
[00:06:24] Mastery level we get is still not enough
[00:06:27] to solve those complex problems anyway
[00:06:29] it's like spending all of this time
[00:06:31] trying to plug the holes in this leaky
[00:06:34] boat and then after all of that trying
[00:06:36] to desperately stay on top of our
[00:06:38] workload we're not even in the right
[00:06:39] boat and so if the process of studying
[00:06:41] for you looks like this then it's pretty
[00:06:45] much impossible to study more and less
[00:06:47] time at least not without changing your
[00:06:50] study methods to form better schemas and
[00:06:53] this is where the three cognitive
[00:06:55] pillars come into play the three
[00:06:57] cognitive pillars are what our learning
[00:07:00] process needs to check off to make sure
[00:07:03] that we're building highquality
[00:07:05] knowledge schemas efficiently and
[00:07:08] effectively and whatever technique
[00:07:10] you're using to study it needs to check
[00:07:13] these three cognitive pillars so I'll
[00:07:15] explain what the three cognitive pillars
[00:07:17] are uh and I'll give you some tips on
[00:07:19] how you can make sure that you're
[00:07:20] checking them off in your studying the
[00:07:21] first pillar is something that in the
[00:07:23] research is called schema
[00:07:26] construction and schema construction
[00:07:28] addresses the the biggest problem that
[00:07:31] students face when trying to form a
[00:07:33] schema when I teach people how to do
[00:07:34] this the most common barrier they face
[00:07:37] is that they get easily overwhelmed cuz
[00:07:39] think about it we're trying to form a
[00:07:41] network of everything that we learn
[00:07:43] there are so many pieces of information
[00:07:45] and Concepts and facts that we need to
[00:07:47] connect together and think about and
[00:07:49] hold on to it can be overwhelming and so
[00:07:51] the way that we prevent that overwhelm
[00:07:54] is with the schema construction pillar
[00:07:57] and schema construction is exactly what
[00:07:58] it sounds like it's about building our
[00:08:00] first schema but here's the tip you want
[00:08:03] to build a draft schema you're just
[00:08:06] laying the foundation for your schema to
[00:08:10] grow so here are three quick tips based
[00:08:13] on my years of experience that can help
[00:08:14] you to build a schema a little bit more
[00:08:16] easily and it's the same advice I give
[00:08:18] in lots of my other videos and it's the
[00:08:20] one I teach in my program as well the
[00:08:21] first step is to just collect keywords
[00:08:24] for the topic that you're about to study
[00:08:26] in the real world when you're trying to
[00:08:27] study something you've got important
[00:08:29] Concepts and terminology and new
[00:08:31] information scattered all over the place
[00:08:33] it's in your lectures the lecture guide
[00:08:34] the textbook videos it splits our
[00:08:38] attention and in fact in the research
[00:08:39] it's actually called the split attention
[00:08:41] effect we can make this a lot easier for
[00:08:43] ourselves by quickly skimming through
[00:08:45] and scanning all the resources that
[00:08:47] we've got available and just making a
[00:08:49] simple list of the keywords on a single
[00:08:52] page just by having this you've given
[00:08:54] yourself a single source to look at so
[00:08:57] that you know the general breadth of
[00:08:59] everything thing that you're going to
[00:09:00] have to learn within this topic and so
[00:09:01] when we're taking those key words and
[00:09:03] then we're trying to connect them
[00:09:05] together and wrap our head around it my
[00:09:07] second hot tip here is to use what you
[00:09:10] know for almost anything that you ever
[00:09:13] learn you're never going to have
[00:09:15] absolutely zero prior knowledge on it
[00:09:17] you're going to have some prior
[00:09:19] knowledge about some aspect of it and it
[00:09:21] may be very superficial but it's more
[00:09:23] than nothing and we want to leverage
[00:09:26] that so start with the keywords that are
[00:09:28] a little bit more famili familar to you
[00:09:30] start with a concept that feel a little
[00:09:32] bit more comfortable and a bit more
[00:09:33] approachable you may know that there are
[00:09:35] a couple things that are already related
[00:09:37] and linked together start with that put
[00:09:40] that down as your first overarching
[00:09:43] scaffold and it doesn't have to be in
[00:09:45] the order that the lecture has it or the
[00:09:47] book has it it doesn't matter we're just
[00:09:49] laying down some foundations to build
[00:09:51] off of later and when it comes to
[00:09:53] constructing scheme is accurately and
[00:09:55] quickly this is incredibly crucial
[00:09:56] because hot tip number three is to take
[00:10:00] a guess when you're making your first
[00:10:03] schema for a new topic that you haven't
[00:10:06] studied before you're not going to be
[00:10:08] accurate you're not going to know if for
[00:10:11] sure these things are connected in this
[00:10:13] way and you're not going to understand
[00:10:15] every single keyword because we haven't
[00:10:17] spent much time reading or studying it
[00:10:20] yet but that's not the point we want to
[00:10:23] take a guess about what some of these
[00:10:25] relationships might be what some of
[00:10:27] these keywords might mean how they might
[00:10:30] come together and influence each other
[00:10:32] and create a network because once we've
[00:10:34] got that and we've got it on paper we
[00:10:37] can look at it and it's much easier to
[00:10:40] track our thoughts we can always change
[00:10:42] it and correct it and we should be doing
[00:10:45] that as we study more the biggest
[00:10:47] mistake I see people making is that
[00:10:49] they'll go into every single keyword in
[00:10:51] a lot of detail straight off the bat we
[00:10:53] don't need to do that and in fact pillar
[00:10:56] number three which I'll talk about later
[00:10:57] actually is dedicated to helping you
[00:11:00] cover all of that detail you're not
[00:11:02] going to miss it don't worry if you jump
[00:11:04] into that detail too early right now
[00:11:07] you're just going to get overwhelmed and
[00:11:09] it's it's just going to make the entire
[00:11:10] learning process unnecessarily difficult
[00:11:12] so if you follow these three tips you
[00:11:14] should be able to form your first draft
[00:11:17] schema relatively easily and it
[00:11:20] shouldn't take you too long and so once
[00:11:21] we' have formed our first schema through
[00:11:24] schema construction we now have the
[00:11:26] opportunity to upgrade that schema and
[00:11:29] upgrade our knowledge and it's this
[00:11:31] process of upgrading our schema that
[00:11:33] allows us to study more and less time
[00:11:35] without sacrificing the quality of that
[00:11:37] knowledge and so to upgrade our schema
[00:11:39] we can move on to the second cognitive
[00:11:41] pillar which is called schema
[00:11:45] assimilation schema assimilation is
[00:11:47] about taking that draft schema that
[00:11:50] draft mind map and network that we
[00:11:52] formed in the first part and then we're
[00:11:54] adding onto it we're opening up our
[00:11:57] textbook we're going through the lecture
[00:11:59] sure we're consuming all this additional
[00:12:02] information but unlike before where
[00:12:05] we're just increasing that information
[00:12:07] and then it's just being lost because
[00:12:09] our attention is poor because we did
[00:12:12] step number one and we formed this draft
[00:12:15] schema it means that as soon as this
[00:12:17] knowledge comes into our brain we have a
[00:12:21] schema that's already drafted up for it
[00:12:24] to fit into and immediately we can start
[00:12:27] expanding and developing that schema and
[00:12:29] so the correct approach is to take in a
[00:12:31] piece of this information and then think
[00:12:33] about how does it connect with my
[00:12:36] existing schema how does it relate to
[00:12:38] what I've already got what does it flow
[00:12:41] from and flow to and then you take
[00:12:42] another piece of information well how
[00:12:44] does this piece of information relate to
[00:12:46] the schema and with each new piece of
[00:12:48] information the schema expands now the
[00:12:50] main issue with the second cognitive
[00:12:52] pillar during schem or assimilation that
[00:12:54] I've noticed students run into is that
[00:12:56] they again get very very overwhelmed
[00:12:58] with all all the new information they're
[00:13:00] trying to assimilate like lines and
[00:13:02] arrows and relationships going
[00:13:03] absolutely everywhere so here's my hot
[00:13:06] tips to do schema assimilation a little
[00:13:08] bit more easily the first thing is keep
[00:13:10] it simple again just start with the
[00:13:13] keywords and the concepts that just feel
[00:13:15] easier and simpler to approach as you
[00:13:17] study this more and as you learn more
[00:13:18] about it even the things that are really
[00:13:20] really detailed will start becoming
[00:13:22] simpler to think about because you just
[00:13:23] know more about the topic so you may as
[00:13:25] well just start with the parts that feel
[00:13:27] a little bit more approachable to begin
[00:13:28] with so as you're reading for example
[00:13:30] like a textbook and you read this
[00:13:32] paragraph that feels really complicated
[00:13:34] hard to get you head around and it feels
[00:13:37] really dense and Technical and detailed
[00:13:39] just leave a little note next to it to
[00:13:41] come back to it later and just move on
[00:13:43] move on to the next part that still
[00:13:44] feels relatively approachable and when
[00:13:46] you do it this way naturally what
[00:13:47] happens is the second thing which is
[00:13:49] that you'll start using layers of
[00:13:51] learning instead of just trying to cover
[00:13:53] everything in one Massive Spirit of
[00:13:56] studying you're just going to be picking
[00:13:58] the things that feel like make the most
[00:13:59] sense building a foundation adding to
[00:14:02] that with the next level of stuff that
[00:14:03] makes sense and then as you keep
[00:14:05] studying your knowledge gets more and
[00:14:07] more and more detailed and so when you
[00:14:08] do schema assimilation in this way
[00:14:10] you'll find that your retention of what
[00:14:13] you've just learned improves but also
[00:14:15] your confidence and Mastery of what
[00:14:17] you're learning goes up as well because
[00:14:19] you're actually starting to think about
[00:14:21] the new information in the way that you
[00:14:24] know you have to use it from the very
[00:14:27] beginning now before I get into the
[00:14:29] final cognitive pillar I do have to say
[00:14:30] that building highquality knowledge
[00:14:33] schemas is actually still just one part
[00:14:37] of an effective Learning System and I do
[00:14:40] teach the other parts of the system in
[00:14:42] my program and I can study as well as in
[00:14:44] my other YouTube videos and while I
[00:14:47] think my YouTube videos are helpful I
[00:14:49] wanted to find another way to help you
[00:14:52] guys to develop your skills even faster
[00:14:54] and so I created my free learning drops
[00:14:57] newsletter it's an email sent into your
[00:14:59] inbox every week that I type myself to
[00:15:01] try to help you to learn these research
[00:15:03] back study methods in a fraction of the
[00:15:06] time that it took me so if you're
[00:15:07] interested make sure to check it out
[00:15:08] I'll leave a link in the description for
[00:15:09] you to sign up now returning to the
[00:15:11] cognitive pillars the third pillar
[00:15:13] nicely brings all of this together and
[00:15:16] I've CAU them pillars because you do
[00:15:18] actually need all three of these to get
[00:15:20] the benefit of n schema in fact it's
[00:15:23] actually this third cognitive pillar
[00:15:26] that is the gatekeeper to being able to
[00:15:29] study more and less time and maintain
[00:15:31] the retention and the Mastery and
[00:15:33] unfortunately if you don't execute on
[00:15:35] this final cognitive pillar the entire
[00:15:37] process will probably stay fairly
[00:15:39] overwhelming and not as effective for
[00:15:42] you so this third and final pillar is
[00:15:44] something I call schema
[00:15:47] reorganization and so you remember how
[00:15:49] in the first uh schema construction and
[00:15:52] schema assimilation steps I said that
[00:15:54] it's going to be very messy you're going
[00:15:56] to have points uh lines and arrows
[00:15:58] flying around relationships going
[00:16:00] everywhere it's going to be very
[00:16:01] disorganized and I said that you're
[00:16:02] going to have time later to come back
[00:16:04] and clean it up and add any details and
[00:16:06] correct things well this is the time at
[00:16:09] this point the key is we're actually not
[00:16:13] taking any new information in we're
[00:16:16] simply looking at the schema that we'
[00:16:19] have been forming the information we've
[00:16:21] already added and we're just trying to
[00:16:24] clean it up reorganize it repackage it
[00:16:27] to make it simpler and easier to follow
[00:16:30] so the main purpose here is cleaning and
[00:16:34] simplifying and the main things that
[00:16:35] we're thinking about to do this is how
[00:16:37] can we group the information in a
[00:16:40] different way how can we rearrange the
[00:16:43] items so that it looks cleaner and the
[00:16:46] arrows aren't all crossing over each
[00:16:47] other and is there any irrelevant or
[00:16:49] unnecessary information that we added on
[00:16:52] that we can now remove and surprise
[00:16:54] surprise this step can also be very
[00:16:57] overwhelming for a lot of students and
[00:16:59] the reason that this step can be really
[00:17:01] overwhelming is kind of like if you
[00:17:03] don't clean your room for a really
[00:17:06] really long time and it is so
[00:17:09] disorganized to the point where like you
[00:17:10] don't even know where to begin starting
[00:17:13] to clean it it almost feels like it's
[00:17:14] easier to like set everything on fire
[00:17:17] just like start from scratch and so this
[00:17:19] feeling of it being too overwhelming can
[00:17:21] actually happen usually for two main
[00:17:24] reasons the first one is if in the
[00:17:26] previous steps we actually did follow
[00:17:29] these tips correctly for example if you
[00:17:32] didn't keep it simple enough or you
[00:17:34] focused on too many little details
[00:17:36] during the assimilation and now you're
[00:17:38] just overwhelmed with all of this
[00:17:40] additional information that you don't
[00:17:42] know what to do with and it's just too
[00:17:44] much for your brain to handle like any
[00:17:46] brain to handle like my brain like I'm
[00:17:47] not calling out your brain and so it's
[00:17:49] really important that we actually do
[00:17:51] these first two steps correctly so that
[00:17:53] we're not overwhelming ourselves when we
[00:17:54] need to go and reorganize it but the
[00:17:56] other reason that we can be overwhelmed
[00:17:59] in this final step is when we spend too
[00:18:02] long before doing the reorganization so
[00:18:06] for example if you're spending too long
[00:18:08] in the assimilation phase and you're
[00:18:09] just adding more and more and more
[00:18:11] information we're actually just piling
[00:18:13] up so much information into our schema
[00:18:17] that it becomes overwhelming for us to
[00:18:18] work with so naturally my heart tip for
[00:18:21] doing schema re organization really well
[00:18:24] is to do it often I generally recommend
[00:18:28] that for most studying like at a
[00:18:30] university level for example you should
[00:18:32] be reorganizing your schema which means
[00:18:35] not taking in any new information just
[00:18:38] looking at what you've got and then
[00:18:40] trying to reorganize it once every 10 to
[00:18:42] 15 minutes and so a lot of students when
[00:18:45] they first try to create schemas they'll
[00:18:47] actually spend like one or two or three
[00:18:49] hours just collecting and assimilating
[00:18:52] information to create this huge detailed
[00:18:55] comprehensive map which is good but it's
[00:18:58] very very difficult and overwhelming to
[00:19:00] try to reorganize that and so if this
[00:19:02] happens we're actually going to end up
[00:19:03] with the same problem that we started
[00:19:05] with where we've got so much information
[00:19:07] that we're just stockpiling inside these
[00:19:09] disorganized schemas and our retention
[00:19:11] isn't going to be that high yet so we're
[00:19:14] just going to forget a lot of it and
[00:19:16] we're stuck in like a new Loop of
[00:19:19] relearning but there's actually another
[00:19:21] tip that's probably even more important
[00:19:23] and this is really the thing that you
[00:19:26] need to watch out for my other tip
[00:19:29] is don't just do it often you have to
[00:19:34] actually do it which seems like a
[00:19:37] strange tip but most students do not do
[00:19:42] schema reorganization and the reason
[00:19:45] most students don't do schema
[00:19:47] reorganization is because it actually
[00:19:50] feels like you're studying more slowly
[00:19:53] so if you're trying to study more in
[00:19:55] less time doing schema reorganization
[00:19:58] can feel like you're actually studying
[00:20:01] Less in that time and because of this
[00:20:04] feeling a lot of students don't do the
[00:20:06] schema reorganization they're put off by
[00:20:09] it but here's the reason why it feels
[00:20:12] slower it's because during schema
[00:20:14] reorganization remember we're not taking
[00:20:17] in any new information so if your
[00:20:20] concept of studying faster and covering
[00:20:23] more content is based on how quickly
[00:20:26] you're able to take in information
[00:20:29] this part feels like you have stopped
[00:20:32] learning but it's actually the opposite
[00:20:34] we're spending that time and attention
[00:20:37] on developing that knowledge converting
[00:20:39] the information into a high quality
[00:20:42] knowledge schema and remember this is
[00:20:44] the thing that creates the retention and
[00:20:46] the Mastery and ultimately the results
[00:20:49] and this is the crucial perspective you
[00:20:52] have to have on learning especially when
[00:20:55] you're trying to learn quickly learning
[00:20:57] quickly is is not about how much
[00:21:00] information or content you cover it's
[00:21:02] not about the pages you flick through or
[00:21:05] the lectures you finish it's about how
[00:21:08] quickly you can form highquality
[00:21:10] knowledge schemas and anything that
[00:21:13] delays the formation of the schemas or
[00:21:16] makes the schemas too overwhelming or
[00:21:19] difficult to follow this slows down your
[00:21:22] learning and conversely things like the
[00:21:25] three pillars which help you to form
[00:21:28] these gers more quickly and more
[00:21:30] efficiently speed up your learning and
[00:21:32] if you want some additional support on
[00:21:33] how to master these cognitive pillars or
[00:21:36] other evidence-based study methods then
[00:21:38] make sure to check out that free
[00:21:39] newsletter that I mentioned in the
[00:21:41] description thank you so much for
[00:21:43] watching and I'll see you in the next

=== How to Study 12+ Hours a Day With Focus ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfxHVmNSlQ4

[00:00:00] what's the easiest way to study for 12
[00:00:02] hours a day while staying focused I
[00:00:06] spent years trying to figure that out so
[00:00:07] you don't have to in this video I'll
[00:00:09] teach you exactly that how to make
[00:00:11] studying for long hours with Focus
[00:00:14] simple effective and most importantly
[00:00:16] sustainable in the long term and I'll do
[00:00:18] this by teaching you a powerful concept
[00:00:20] I call the outcome formula using the
[00:00:23] outcome formula is what allowed me to do
[00:00:25] 12 hours 15 hour even 20 hour study days
[00:00:29] back back to back for months at a time
[00:00:32] without burning out now I'm not saying
[00:00:34] you should study all day every day I
[00:00:38] don't recommend that but sometimes
[00:00:40] honestly we just don't have a choice and
[00:00:43] that is where the outcome formula comes
[00:00:45] in so let's start by understanding what
[00:00:48] the outcome formula is and why it works
[00:00:51] the outcome formula tells us which
[00:00:53] factors we need to think about and get
[00:00:57] right to safely and confidently achieve
[00:01:00] dream outcome so let's say that you want
[00:01:02] to get a great exam score that's the
[00:01:05] dream outcome we're aiming for now if
[00:01:07] there's a difficult goal to achieve then
[00:01:09] we probably will need to work very hard
[00:01:12] to achieve it so to achieve this dream
[00:01:14] outcome you might feel like you need to
[00:01:16] study a lot so we'll start off by
[00:01:18] increasing the amount of time that we
[00:01:21] spend studying we do longer study
[00:01:23] sessions and we rearrange our schedule
[00:01:25] to see if we can squeeze in any extra
[00:01:28] time that we can fit in for even more
[00:01:29] more studying but what actually happens
[00:01:31] once we have managed 12 hours a day of
[00:01:35] studying do we now achieve all of our
[00:01:37] goals and live happily ever after for
[00:01:39] most people the answer is still no
[00:01:41] millions of people study just as much
[00:01:44] and most of them still do not achieve
[00:01:45] their dream outcome so there's clearly
[00:01:47] more to success than just studying as
[00:01:50] many hours as humanly possible there's a
[00:01:52] missing piece to this puzzle and that
[00:01:55] missing piece is focus after trying to
[00:01:59] study for 12 hours a day non-stop you
[00:02:01] might realize that you're falling asleep
[00:02:03] and getting distracted after the first
[00:02:05] hour so naturally we also need to think
[00:02:07] about how focused we are in that time in
[00:02:10] other words not only do we need quantity
[00:02:13] but we also need quality with our study
[00:02:16] sessions so what do we do now well at
[00:02:18] this point it seems clear that since we
[00:02:20] have successfully achieved studying more
[00:02:23] hours but we're now losing focus we need
[00:02:26] to work on increasing our focus and if
[00:02:28] you search this up on YouTube you will
[00:02:30] find a bunch of techniques and tips out
[00:02:32] there to increase your focus techniques
[00:02:34] like work rest timing with Pomodoro and
[00:02:36] Fodor and what to do during your break
[00:02:39] and how to manage
[00:02:40] distractions and all of those things do
[00:02:43] help but here's the thing there's still
[00:02:45] a major problem we have yet to address
[00:02:49] and the problem is the fact that we're
[00:02:51] actually still missing another piece of
[00:02:55] the outcome formula and it's this
[00:02:58] missing piece that can make make people
[00:03:00] spend hours and hours a day studying all
[00:03:03] day they're doing as much as they can to
[00:03:05] stay focused they're using all the right
[00:03:07] Focus techniques but they're still not
[00:03:09] getting the results that they want and
[00:03:10] it feels like it's getting harder and
[00:03:12] harder to study so much and stay focused
[00:03:15] in other words they're getting burnt out
[00:03:17] and for me it took me many years of
[00:03:20] getting burnt out to realize this
[00:03:23] missing piece and the missing piece is
[00:03:25] to realize that quality isn't just about
[00:03:30] Focus it's also
[00:03:32] about impact and when we add impact to
[00:03:37] the formula it completely changes the
[00:03:39] game because adding impact not only
[00:03:42] helps us to achieve a better quality but
[00:03:45] it also helps us to increase our
[00:03:48] quantity and study four more hours in a
[00:03:51] day and it makes this process much
[00:03:54] easier and more productive now you may
[00:03:56] be wondering what impact actually means
[00:03:58] in the context of the outcome formula
[00:04:00] impact refers to how effective your
[00:04:04] methods actually are at helping you to
[00:04:07] achieve your dream outcome and for
[00:04:09] studying and learning the processes and
[00:04:12] techniques you use like how you read a
[00:04:15] textbook or how you listen during a
[00:04:17] lecture or how you write your notes all
[00:04:19] of these different techniques and
[00:04:21] processes have different levels of
[00:04:24] impact and understanding the difference
[00:04:26] between these different levels of impact
[00:04:28] is one of the Hallmarks of a a top 1%
[00:04:30] learner let's understand some of these
[00:04:32] differences ourselves using a high
[00:04:34] impact method allows us to achieve the
[00:04:38] level of knowledge that we need and to
[00:04:41] store it in our memory more effectively
[00:04:43] if you use a high impact method for 12
[00:04:46] hours a day you finish the day much more
[00:04:49] confident and much more prepared than at
[00:04:51] the beginning of the day you know more
[00:04:53] you have stored it strongly in your
[00:04:56] memory and you can use that knowledge
[00:04:58] accurately on the other hand and a low
[00:05:00] impact method is the opposite when we
[00:05:03] use a low impact method it doesn't help
[00:05:06] us understand the material that we're
[00:05:08] learning very deeply and it makes our
[00:05:10] memory very poor we don't hold on to
[00:05:12] that information very strongly spending
[00:05:14] 12 hours a day covering a bunch of stuff
[00:05:16] using a low impact method probably makes
[00:05:20] you feel worse and more anxious than
[00:05:22] when you started you've technically
[00:05:25] covered a bunch of stuff but you feel it
[00:05:27] slipping out of your memory by the hour
[00:05:29] and you certainly don't feel confident
[00:05:30] to be tested on it despite having spent
[00:05:33] the entire day studying it now I will
[00:05:35] later in the video actually show you how
[00:05:37] you can tell a high impact method from a
[00:05:40] low impact method and that's going to be
[00:05:42] gamechanging but for now what I'll tell
[00:05:45] you is that a higher impact method tends
[00:05:48] to also be more complex and more
[00:05:51] Uncommon for me personally I didn't have
[00:05:54] anyone guiding me through this so it
[00:05:56] took around 6 years of experimenting and
[00:05:59] reading re research to figure out that
[00:06:01] even the concept of a high impact or a
[00:06:03] low impact method existed and then to
[00:06:05] actually develop my high impact method
[00:06:07] now with the videos I release most of
[00:06:10] the stuff I talk about is high impact so
[00:06:13] by watching my videos you should be able
[00:06:15] to optimize your methods month after
[00:06:17] month but if you want to do it even
[00:06:18] faster than that I also have a free
[00:06:21] newsletter you can sign up to and the
[00:06:23] newsletter covers almost exclusively
[00:06:26] either high impact methods or the
[00:06:28] prerequisites you need to unlock to
[00:06:30] learn more high impact methods it takes
[00:06:32] about 3 to 5 minutes to read every week
[00:06:35] and it should cut down the amount of
[00:06:37] time that you need to spend to build a
[00:06:39] high impact system Honestly by like
[00:06:43] hundreds of hours again it's totally
[00:06:45] free so if you want to sign up I'll
[00:06:46] leave a link in the description for you
[00:06:48] and if you're still not convinced that
[00:06:50] learning a high impact method should be
[00:06:52] a high priority for you I'm about to
[00:06:53] change that because impact actually has
[00:06:57] another effect one that most people
[00:07:01] don't know about the reason it's crucial
[00:07:03] to understand impact if you want to
[00:07:06] study for long hours while staying
[00:07:09] focused is because the level of impact
[00:07:12] also affects your level of focus Recent
[00:07:17] research has actually shown that low
[00:07:19] impact methods actually reduce your
[00:07:22] concentration and make it easier for you
[00:07:25] to get distracted in the first place in
[00:07:28] other words High impact methods increase
[00:07:32] your focus low impact methods decrease
[00:07:35] your focus and this changes everything
[00:07:39] because now impact is the most important
[00:07:42] part of the outcome formula when we
[00:07:45] increase the impact of the method that
[00:07:47] we use not only does it directly improve
[00:07:50] the quality it also makes it easier to
[00:07:54] study for long hours and to do that with
[00:07:57] higher focus on the other hand it also
[00:08:00] means that low impact methods aren't
[00:08:03] just ineffective they're actually
[00:08:05] harmful if you use a low impact method
[00:08:09] for hours and hours a day not only is it
[00:08:12] reducing your quality of knowledge
[00:08:14] giving you a superficial Mastery and a
[00:08:16] poor memory and worsening anxiety it
[00:08:19] also drains your focus and wastes
[00:08:22] additional time which forces you to
[00:08:25] spend even more time studying which
[00:08:28] actually drains even more focused it's
[00:08:31] trapping us in a vicious negative spiral
[00:08:35] as the quantity of our studying goes up
[00:08:38] our quality of studying actually goes
[00:08:41] down which means more time and effort
[00:08:45] for no real change in result and this is
[00:08:48] exactly how I felt during my first year
[00:08:50] of medical school I was studying so hard
[00:08:54] and trying so hard to keep up with my
[00:08:55] peers but I had classmates who were like
[00:08:58] laughing and having fun while they were
[00:09:00] studying and they made it look so
[00:09:01] effortless and they were doing better
[00:09:03] than me and that's when I realized that
[00:09:06] the way that I was approaching things
[00:09:08] must be wrong so if you resonate with
[00:09:10] that then here's how I turned things
[00:09:12] around which made focusing and studying
[00:09:15] for long hours a day much easier the
[00:09:17] trick is to start with impact so instead
[00:09:20] of trying to achieve our Dream outcome
[00:09:23] by just studying more in other words
[00:09:25] putting in more quantity and then trying
[00:09:29] to improve our quality we're going to do
[00:09:32] this in Reverse we're actually going to
[00:09:34] start with quality specifically we're
[00:09:37] going to start by maximizing our impact
[00:09:40] we want to remove the low impact methods
[00:09:43] that you're using and then gradually
[00:09:46] replace them with higher impact ones
[00:09:48] then we figure out how much time we need
[00:09:53] to use those high impact methods and
[00:09:56] that actually determines the quantity of
[00:09:59] stud that we need to do it's not here's
[00:10:01] how much I want to study and let's see
[00:10:03] what I can do it's here's the method I
[00:10:06] need to use how long is it going to take
[00:10:09] me to use that method and remember when
[00:10:12] we use a high impact method we don't
[00:10:14] need to take as many breaks and we don't
[00:10:16] need to like Pomodoro Timer our way
[00:10:18] through every hour of work it becomes
[00:10:21] naturally easier to focus for long
[00:10:24] periods of time and that's because we've
[00:10:26] actually removed this source of poor
[00:10:29] focus in the first place which was the
[00:10:31] low impact method and so instead of a
[00:10:32] negative spiral it's a positive spiral
[00:10:35] where you spend some effort and energy
[00:10:39] and focus to perform this higher impact
[00:10:42] method but it actually returns some of
[00:10:44] that Focus back to you and then if we
[00:10:47] find that we still need sort of topups
[00:10:50] in our Focus then we can take a few
[00:10:53] little breaks here and there and use
[00:10:55] those Focus strategies uh and tips and
[00:10:59] it's easy it's just a top up now a lot
[00:11:01] of students I work with think that their
[00:11:04] methods are already high impact when
[00:11:06] they're certainly not so how do we
[00:11:09] actually tell what a high impact method
[00:11:12] is versus a low impact one well
[00:11:14] fortunately our brain actually tells us
[00:11:17] in a way some researchers suggest that
[00:11:19] our brain is actually hardwired to enjoy
[00:11:22] high impact methods more so we can
[00:11:24] actually tell when we're using a higher
[00:11:27] impact method because it actually feels
[00:11:31] more engaging and it involves lots of
[00:11:35] back and forth thinking as we're trying
[00:11:36] to solve problems and figure things out
[00:11:39] and answer the questions that pop up in
[00:11:41] our head and it also often requires more
[00:11:44] effort to correctly perform like I
[00:11:47] mentioned high impact methods tend to be
[00:11:49] more mentally complex and so it requires
[00:11:53] more active focus and energy to perform
[00:11:57] but remember it also returns s and
[00:11:59] generates more Focus for us FYI the
[00:12:02] higher order learning strategies which I
[00:12:04] teach all the time tick all of these
[00:12:06] boxes on the other hand when we use a
[00:12:09] low impact method we can tell because it
[00:12:13] feels tedious and boring and it makes us
[00:12:17] feel drowsy it often involves very
[00:12:20] monotonous and repetitive thinking and
[00:12:23] it
[00:12:24] requires very little effort to perform
[00:12:27] so think back to when you fell asleep
[00:12:30] reading a textbook or when you felt
[00:12:32] drowsy after doing your 200th flash card
[00:12:35] for the day but here's the thing right
[00:12:37] why would anyone use a low impact method
[00:12:42] if they're so bad in the first place the
[00:12:44] answer is that it's because low impact
[00:12:46] methods are much easier it's much easier
[00:12:49] to stick with a low impact method that
[00:12:51] you're comfortable with and just do more
[00:12:53] of it more quantity than to make the
[00:12:57] switch to a high impact method
[00:12:59] however taking the time to learn a high
[00:13:02] impact method is the solution to make
[00:13:05] studying feel less boring and more
[00:13:07] effective and allow you to do more
[00:13:09] effective studying in a single day so
[00:13:11] next time you study you can actually ask
[00:13:13] yourself which of these boxes do I take
[00:13:16] when I'm studying and by checking how
[00:13:18] your method feels and the type of
[00:13:20] thinking it involves and the amount of
[00:13:21] effort it requires you can tell whether
[00:13:23] you're using a low impact or high impact
[00:13:24] method but wait there's more because the
[00:13:27] real reward from switching from a low
[00:13:30] impact to a high impact method is not in
[00:13:32] being able to study with Focus for 12
[00:13:36] hours a day the real reward is that
[00:13:38] eventually you get so much value out of
[00:13:40] every hour you do spend studying that
[00:13:43] you'll either study for just a few hours
[00:13:46] and get the same results as before or
[00:13:48] even better which means more free time
[00:13:52] which means maybe you will finally get
[00:13:54] the amount of sleep you need or if you
[00:13:56] do choose to study those long hours
[00:13:59] you'll be able to do even better and
[00:14:01] that's how you really get ahead so
[00:14:03] regardless of how much you want to study
[00:14:05] focusing on the outcome formula and in
[00:14:08] particular maximizing your impact is a
[00:14:10] win-win situation and if you want to
[00:14:12] learn about some of the high impact
[00:14:14] methods that I think are the most useful
[00:14:17] then don't forget to sign up to my free
[00:14:18] Weekly Newsletter with the link in the
[00:14:21] description I hope this helps thank you
[00:14:23] so much for watching and I'll see you

=== Give me 14 minutes, And I'll Turn You Into An Academic Weapon ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeOfsMHc7E4

[00:00:00] this video I'm going to help you to
[00:00:01] become an academic weapon and I Define
[00:00:04] an academic weapon as someone who's not
[00:00:06] just getting by but absolutely
[00:00:09] obliterating the standards required to
[00:00:12] succeed and I'm going to do this by
[00:00:13] teaching you a technique called visible
[00:00:16] process mapping which you can learn and
[00:00:18] apply in less than 24 hours visible
[00:00:20] process mapping is something I've
[00:00:21] developed and used in my coaching
[00:00:23] practice for years and it's something
[00:00:25] that I do in almost every private
[00:00:27] consultation and the reason visible
[00:00:28] process mapping works is because it
[00:00:31] helps us overcome something that I call
[00:00:32] learning baggage which is one of the
[00:00:35] most common reasons that stops students
[00:00:37] from achieving their academic goals in
[00:00:39] the first place now the easiest way to
[00:00:42] understand what learning baggage is and
[00:00:45] how it sabotages us is to understand the
[00:00:49] trajectory of an academic weapon see a
[00:00:51] lot of quick tips and studying hacks can
[00:00:53] be a total waste of time because it
[00:00:55] doesn't change our academic trajectory
[00:00:59] in other words if your trajectory looks
[00:01:01] like this where you're barely meeting
[00:01:04] your next academic Challenge and it's
[00:01:06] getting harder and harder to keep up
[00:01:08] until eventually you just fall behind
[00:01:11] then just one or two little changes from
[00:01:13] a 30-second Tik Tok is probably not
[00:01:16] going to be enough if you want to be on
[00:01:17] the academic weapon trajectory where
[00:01:20] it's actually getting easier and easier
[00:01:22] to overcome your academic challenges
[00:01:24] over time then we have to clearly
[00:01:28] understand where our current current
[00:01:30] weaknesses and limitations are in other
[00:01:33] words what are the things that are
[00:01:35] holding us back from being on this
[00:01:39] academic weapon trajectory and the
[00:01:41] answer is learning baggage learning
[00:01:46] baggage refers to the invisible habits
[00:01:50] that work against us and we all have
[00:01:52] these habits now habit might be
[00:01:54] something like cracking your knuckles or
[00:01:56] playing with your hair but it can also
[00:01:58] be a much more extend Ive process like
[00:02:01] your entire morning routine of how you
[00:02:03] get out of bed and brush your teeth and
[00:02:05] get ready to leave for the day or it
[00:02:07] might be the way that you warm up before
[00:02:09] a workout they are processes that you
[00:02:11] have done lots of times and have become
[00:02:15] autopilot but learning baggage is
[00:02:18] invisible because they are cognitive
[00:02:21] habits meaning that they happen in our
[00:02:23] brain these are ways of thinking that we
[00:02:26] run on autopilot and when it comes to
[00:02:28] learning our cognitive habits
[00:02:30] directly dictate our academic success or
[00:02:33] failure and most people have never
[00:02:35] thought about their learning baggage so
[00:02:36] it continues to sabotage them again and
[00:02:39] again so here is how learning baggage
[00:02:41] prevents us from becoming an academic
[00:02:43] weapon learning is a series of cognitive
[00:02:47] processes and some of these processes
[00:02:49] like higher R learning are beneficial
[00:02:51] for our long-term memory as well as our
[00:02:54] ability to perform but our brain doesn't
[00:02:57] just automatically do the these
[00:03:00] processes otherwise learning would be
[00:03:01] easy instead we have to use techniques
[00:03:05] to try and Trigger these processes to
[00:03:08] happen in our brain and now here's where
[00:03:11] learning baggage comes in most of these
[00:03:14] techniques are things that we kind of
[00:03:15] just picked up here and there over the
[00:03:18] years we might have seen something that
[00:03:20] our friends use we've read something
[00:03:22] seen something online it's sort of this
[00:03:24] haphazard combination and some of these
[00:03:27] techniques are good and work for us but
[00:03:29] then some of them aren't very effective
[00:03:31] but over time these techniques and the
[00:03:35] processes that they activate become
[00:03:38] habits which means that some of these
[00:03:40] techniques and processes which we're now
[00:03:43] running on autopilot because they've
[00:03:45] become habits are actually detrimental
[00:03:48] to our learning we've basically
[00:03:50] automated something that makes us worse
[00:03:53] and in doing so we have created learning
[00:03:57] baggage these harmful and our habitual
[00:04:01] processes will continue to reduce our
[00:04:04] memory and performance again and again
[00:04:07] every time we go to learn something in
[00:04:10] fact even if you learn a great technique
[00:04:13] those habitual cognitive processes will
[00:04:17] actually make you perform it incorrectly
[00:04:20] that's why you can use the same exact
[00:04:23] technique as a top achiever but not get
[00:04:25] the same result this is how our learning
[00:04:28] baggage can ruin our our academic
[00:04:30] trajectory so then how do we get rid of
[00:04:33] this baggage and improve our trajectory
[00:04:36] unfortunately many of these cognitive
[00:04:38] habits are invisible which means that
[00:04:41] most people are not aware of the habits
[00:04:44] and processes that they use and even if
[00:04:46] they are aware they don't know which
[00:04:48] part specifically is helpful versus
[00:04:51] harmful they just think that overall my
[00:04:54] studying is working for me or it's not
[00:04:57] and it's actually this fact that
[00:04:59] learning baggage is invisible that can
[00:05:02] potentially keep someone on a downhill
[00:05:04] trajectory for the rest of their life
[00:05:06] just imagine someone comes up to you and
[00:05:08] says that they're struggling with their
[00:05:09] studying they're getting bad results and
[00:05:11] they don't know why they can't really
[00:05:14] explain their learning process uh
[00:05:16] they're just doing a bunch of things
[00:05:17] that their friends told them to do a
[00:05:19] while ago they don't know what's working
[00:05:21] they don't know what's not and frankly
[00:05:23] they haven't really spent a lot of time
[00:05:25] or effort thinking about this would you
[00:05:27] expect that that person would actually
[00:05:30] improve no it's obvious that this person
[00:05:33] is not on a great trajectory yes
[00:05:36] partially because they probably don't
[00:05:37] have great techniques but mostly because
[00:05:41] they don't even know what they're doing
[00:05:44] right or wrong which is why the first
[00:05:47] step of becoming an academic weapon
[00:05:49] before learning any technique is just to
[00:05:51] make this invisible learning baggage
[00:05:54] visible the way we do that is with
[00:05:57] visible process mapping now before
[00:05:59] before I go into the actual mapping
[00:06:00] process and demonstration the first
[00:06:02] thing that you can do to get a huge head
[00:06:04] start on this is to get your major
[00:06:06] learning habits assessed if I were in
[00:06:08] front of you right now then I would just
[00:06:10] ask you a bunch of questions and
[00:06:11] evaluate you on the spot unfortunately I
[00:06:13] can't do that for every single one of
[00:06:15] you so I've created a free quiz which is
[00:06:17] the next best thing takes about 2
[00:06:19] minutes to answer a bunch of questions
[00:06:21] and then at the end it will give you a
[00:06:23] report that tells you which major areas
[00:06:26] of your learning might be your learning
[00:06:28] baggage the quiz is completely free to
[00:06:30] do and although it doesn't replace the
[00:06:33] visible process mapping it will make it
[00:06:35] a lot easier and probably much more
[00:06:37] accurate I'll leave a link to the quiz
[00:06:39] for you in the description so here's how
[00:06:40] we do the visible process map it's
[00:06:43] basically a record of your entire
[00:06:45] learning flow and I'm using this table
[00:06:48] here I'll leave a link as well in the
[00:06:50] description where you can go and access
[00:06:52] this to do it yourself we're going to
[00:06:54] start off by putting in some baseline
[00:06:56] performance metrics of how we're finding
[00:06:58] things so far so let's say my results
[00:07:01] right now tend to be good my confidence
[00:07:04] is okay my confidence to recall facts is
[00:07:07] let's say high but my confidence to
[00:07:09] answer challenging questions or
[00:07:11] curveball questions might be kind of low
[00:07:15] uh overall I feel like I spend more time
[00:07:18] than others studying and the time that I
[00:07:20] spend relearning material that I forgot
[00:07:22] is let's say moderate 20 to 40% of my
[00:07:25] studying time is just relearning stuff
[00:07:27] that I forgot this helps us to calibrate
[00:07:29] how effective our learning flow is now
[00:07:32] you'll notice that in the middle of this
[00:07:33] I've got this thing that's highlighted
[00:07:35] called the main learning event the main
[00:07:37] learning event is really the first time
[00:07:40] where you're going to sit down and
[00:07:42] properly be exposed to the topic in most
[00:07:46] situations this is a lecture covering it
[00:07:49] in class if you're self-studying it's
[00:07:51] the first time you sit down with a
[00:07:54] dedicated study session to say hey I'm
[00:07:56] going to cover this topic now and then
[00:07:58] what we do is we say well what are we
[00:08:00] doing during that main learning event so
[00:08:04] let's say for example we're talking
[00:08:05] about this being a lecture then what am
[00:08:08] I doing inside this lecture we want to
[00:08:10] write down this process reasonably
[00:08:12] specifically so let's say that I'm uh
[00:08:13] listening to the lecturer uh I'm writing
[00:08:16] some notes and again be specific what do
[00:08:18] the notes look like they're linear they
[00:08:20] use uh bullet points I'm copy pasting
[00:08:23] some diagrams into it and in the next
[00:08:26] column we're saying why what's the
[00:08:28] rationale for using that as a technique
[00:08:32] we're trying to make that invisible
[00:08:35] connection between the technique we use
[00:08:37] and the process that it's meant to
[00:08:38] activate I'm trying to make that more
[00:08:40] visible so well I'm doing it because
[00:08:43] it's meant to help me Focus it's meant
[00:08:46] to help me concentrate uh I think if I
[00:08:49] do it it's going to help me to remember
[00:08:50] the information more accurately it's
[00:08:52] going to help me to understand it a
[00:08:54] little bit more deeply and then the next
[00:08:56] column you see certainty it's how sure
[00:09:00] are you how sure am I that doing all of
[00:09:02] this what is actually achieving the why
[00:09:06] in this case maybe it's uh I'm actually
[00:09:09] not too sure and we're going to work
[00:09:10] through this going before and after the
[00:09:13] main learning event so let's say before
[00:09:15] uh 30 minutes before we're doing some
[00:09:18] kind of uh pre-study type of Step we're
[00:09:20] going to fill that in and let's say uh 3
[00:09:23] hours afterwards I'm going to go and
[00:09:25] review my notes and then again we fill
[00:09:27] that in in a little bit more detail and
[00:09:29] let's say uh one week later we're doing
[00:09:31] some kind of review and let's say you
[00:09:33] know 3 weeks after that or a week before
[00:09:35] our exam we're basically taking a single
[00:09:38] piece of information and we're tracing
[00:09:41] what we do with that information from
[00:09:43] the first moment we make contact with it
[00:09:45] all the way through to when you need to
[00:09:48] use it like an exam or an assessment
[00:09:49] solving some kind of case and this is a
[00:09:51] very very useful activity for a number
[00:09:54] of reasons first of all if you don't
[00:09:56] even know what you're doing you found
[00:09:59] some definite learning baggage the
[00:10:01] chances that you're doing all the right
[00:10:03] things without even really knowing what
[00:10:06] you're doing is very slim let's say you
[00:10:08] know what you're doing but you're not
[00:10:10] really sure why you think you're just
[00:10:12] doing it because that's what I'm used to
[00:10:14] doing it's a habit now that could be
[00:10:18] learning baggage maybe it's a habit that
[00:10:20] you developed years ago that served you
[00:10:22] back when you were 8 years old but now
[00:10:25] maybe should be optimized and in this
[00:10:27] final column with certainty that's
[00:10:29] another opportunity to find learning
[00:10:31] baggage you know that you're doing
[00:10:33] something that's meant to achieve some
[00:10:36] kind of goal or effect but it might not
[00:10:38] actually be doing that so that's another
[00:10:41] possible habit or belief that you've had
[00:10:44] that you never really critically
[00:10:46] challenged now remember not every habit
[00:10:49] that you find is going to be learning
[00:10:51] baggage remember it's a combination of
[00:10:53] some things that are useful and working
[00:10:55] for you and some things that are not the
[00:10:56] point of the exercise is to make the
[00:10:58] invisible
[00:10:59] visible at the bottom of the template
[00:11:01] I've also left a number of questions
[00:11:03] that you can ask yourself that can help
[00:11:05] you reflect on your learning process a
[00:11:06] little bit more deeply these are types
[00:11:08] of questions that people don't generally
[00:11:10] tend to ask themselves but they're also
[00:11:12] questions that I always ask when I do a
[00:11:15] learning consultation because it makes
[00:11:17] the learning baggage very obvious just
[00:11:19] to show you what it looks like when it's
[00:11:20] completed here's an example of one that
[00:11:22] I did for one of my students during an
[00:11:23] initial consultation and here's what I
[00:11:25] want you to notice is that a lot of the
[00:11:27] things that they were doing they were
[00:11:30] not very sure about it was a lot of like
[00:11:31] notur as maybe or definitely not so what
[00:11:34] this means is that they had a method of
[00:11:36] learning where they were doing a lot of
[00:11:39] things just based on previous habits a
[00:11:42] lot of baggage and so for this student
[00:11:44] her name's anelie for Anie uh one of the
[00:11:47] light bulb moments for her when she did
[00:11:49] this was she found that she was spending
[00:11:51] like 3 hours writing these notes because
[00:11:55] it was to help her understand it and
[00:11:57] help her to remember it but then she was
[00:11:59] also spending like 3 hours a day doing
[00:12:02] flash cards on the same stuff that she
[00:12:04] wrote the notes on because her notes
[00:12:07] didn't help her to actually remember it
[00:12:09] anyway so she was able to see that there
[00:12:12] was directly a technique that she was
[00:12:14] doing purely because her first attempt
[00:12:17] was not successful and that's something
[00:12:19] that I call a Band-Aid technique a
[00:12:22] Band-Aid is something that you do
[00:12:24] because you didn't do it right the first
[00:12:25] time now here's a comparison of her
[00:12:27] process map three mon months after
[00:12:30] working through this and I want you to
[00:12:32] look at the difference the certainty of
[00:12:34] the technique was much much stronger so
[00:12:37] for aneli by looking at her initial map
[00:12:40] and then finding these possible areas
[00:12:42] where there could be all this learning
[00:12:44] baggage and then working on techniques
[00:12:46] and optimizing that she was able to get
[00:12:48] to this higher level of certainty which
[00:12:51] translates into not only getting better
[00:12:53] results but having more confidence to
[00:12:56] achieve those results more consistently
[00:12:59] and predictably now I have mapped the
[00:13:01] learning processes face Toof face and
[00:13:03] consultations for hundreds of my
[00:13:06] students and I can tell you that the
[00:13:08] students that actually bother to do a
[00:13:12] visible process Map and find their
[00:13:15] possible learning baggage and then
[00:13:17] optimize and iterate to overcome them
[00:13:20] they are the ones that are on the
[00:13:22] trajectory to being an academic weapon
[00:13:25] it doesn't mean that after 24 hours they
[00:13:26] have become an academic weapon but they
[00:13:28] are on the trajectory and I know that
[00:13:32] even if this video is viewed thousands
[00:13:33] of times that most of you will not
[00:13:36] actually make a process map or change
[00:13:38] your trajectory and that's because your
[00:13:41] learning baggage may tell you no this
[00:13:45] isn't right that's not how you're going
[00:13:47] to achieve your academic goals no what
[00:13:49] you need is a better technique that is
[00:13:52] what your baggage will tell you and if
[00:13:54] that's what you're thinking then well I
[00:13:57] think you should reflect on that
[00:13:59] but anyway thank you so much for
[00:14:00] watching and I'll see you next time

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3TgxIMt1cE

[00:00:00] a few weeks ago I caught up with an old
[00:00:01] friend of mine from Medical School his
[00:00:03] name's James uh he's a doctor now and
[00:00:06] he's trying to specialize in trauma
[00:00:07] surgery and he was talking about how he
[00:00:09] wanted my help because he felt like he
[00:00:11] was falling behind he was saying that he
[00:00:14] felt frustrated he felt overwhelmed and
[00:00:18] I could tell that he was clearly burnt
[00:00:20] out he said that despite sacrificing so
[00:00:23] much to study as much as he could he
[00:00:26] still felt like he was falling behind I
[00:00:28] mean this is a guy who's working 70
[00:00:30] hours a week as a surgical doctor and
[00:00:32] then he's studying 10 to 15 hours per
[00:00:35] week on top of that in his off time he's
[00:00:38] not spending time with his friends uh
[00:00:40] he's not doing any hobbies he's not
[00:00:41] spending time with his partner even just
[00:00:44] organizing the coffee ketchup took a
[00:00:47] month of planning so anyway we chatted
[00:00:49] for a couple of hours dissecting how
[00:00:51] James was studying and what he's doing
[00:00:53] to not fall behind and there were just a
[00:00:57] lot of issues and mistakes and even even
[00:01:00] though most people see him as a high
[00:01:02] achiever the mistakes he were making
[00:01:04] were the same ones that I see in most
[00:01:06] people who are falling behind so in this
[00:01:09] video I want to share with you the
[00:01:10] perspective that I shared with James
[00:01:12] that completely changed the way that he
[00:01:14] thinks about catching up and regaining
[00:01:17] control over his workload and his life I
[00:01:20] call it the infinite staircase and by
[00:01:23] the end of our coffees James said that
[00:01:25] he felt like a complete idiot trying to
[00:01:28] catch up and get get ahead without
[00:01:30] realizing that it was actually making
[00:01:33] him fall behind even more once you
[00:01:35] understand the infinite staircase you
[00:01:37] will understand why you are falling
[00:01:39] behind right now but more importantly
[00:01:42] what you really need to do to catch up
[00:01:45] and get ahead it makes beating even
[00:01:48] overwhelming challenges much easier
[00:01:51] faster safer and much less tiring which
[00:01:55] helps to prevent burnout so what is the
[00:01:57] infinite staircase the infinite
[00:01:59] staircase is a way of thinking about
[00:02:02] challenges whether that challenge is
[00:02:04] passing an exam getting your dream job
[00:02:07] getting promoted or even just learning
[00:02:09] so that you can tackle a complicated
[00:02:12] problem the infinite staircase is a lens
[00:02:14] through which you should view challenges
[00:02:16] and the reason it's so useful to look at
[00:02:19] challenges through this lens is because
[00:02:21] it helps you to see and realize which
[00:02:24] approaches are likely to leave you burnt
[00:02:28] out and falling behind and which
[00:02:30] approaches are more likely to lead to
[00:02:32] success so imagine you've got this
[00:02:34] challenge to overcome let's say it's
[00:02:36] studying 200 pages of a textbook uh in
[00:02:39] the next 3 weeks for an important exam
[00:02:42] so this here is the challenge and then
[00:02:44] here is US looking at the challenge now
[00:02:47] people will try to overcome this
[00:02:49] challenge in one of three ways the first
[00:02:52] way is what I call the effort first
[00:02:56] approach and this is what most people do
[00:02:58] which pretty much guarantees that you're
[00:03:01] going to burn out eventually most people
[00:03:03] will look at the challenge and say I
[00:03:05] need this much time and effort to
[00:03:07] overcome that challenge and they focus
[00:03:09] on just putting in the time and effort
[00:03:11] that they need and frankly this is an
[00:03:13] absolutely terrible way of thinking
[00:03:16] about challenges because it doesn't
[00:03:18] consider the processes and the skills
[00:03:20] and the attributes that we will need to
[00:03:22] develop that actually translate this
[00:03:25] time and effort into actual results it's
[00:03:28] like trying to put more and more fuel
[00:03:31] into a broken car when you try to
[00:03:33] overcome challenges using this effort
[00:03:35] first approach you're relying on lot on
[00:03:38] your natural intelligence and natural
[00:03:41] abilities your performance depends a lot
[00:03:43] on just how motivated you are and even
[00:03:46] if you are successful this time round
[00:03:49] it's just unnecessarily tiring and risky
[00:03:52] now this effort first approach is what I
[00:03:55] used to do and that's directly what made
[00:03:58] me burn out if you're using this
[00:04:01] approach then you are probably already
[00:04:04] falling behind or have fallen so far
[00:04:06] behind you have no idea how you're going
[00:04:08] to catch up again uh and maybe you're
[00:04:10] already burnt out like a charred hollow
[00:04:13] shell of the energetic person you you
[00:04:15] once used to be and if you're not uh
[00:04:18] then you probably will be falling behind
[00:04:20] and burning out eventually but my friend
[00:04:23] James didn't use this approach he
[00:04:25] actually used the second approach this
[00:04:27] second approach is much safer and much
[00:04:30] easier and I call this the effort second
[00:04:35] approach pretty easy to remember now
[00:04:38] this second approach is already fairly
[00:04:40] uncommon it involves first looking at
[00:04:44] the processes skills and attributes that
[00:04:47] we are going to need to develop and then
[00:04:49] we apply the amount of time and effort
[00:04:52] that's needed to do the work and develop
[00:04:55] those skills and attributes so if we
[00:04:57] imagine this challenge like a wave
[00:05:00] coming towards us and we are on a little
[00:05:03] boat the effort first approach is like
[00:05:07] looking at this challenge being on a
[00:05:09] tiny little dinghy and focusing on
[00:05:12] pedling so hard that we're able to
[00:05:15] overcome that wave whereas the effort
[00:05:18] second approach is about upgrading our
[00:05:22] boat so that it is sturdier and can
[00:05:24] withstand it so we don't need to apply
[00:05:27] so much effort in the first place place
[00:05:30] when it comes to learning this boat is
[00:05:32] our learning habits and processes it's
[00:05:36] how we read and write notes and encode
[00:05:39] and re-encode and retrieve our knowledge
[00:05:41] there are dozens of these processes that
[00:05:43] come together to form a learning system
[00:05:46] well that's if you're good at studying
[00:05:48] most people just slap together a couple
[00:05:51] random techniques that they picked up
[00:05:52] off their friends and call it a day and
[00:05:54] by the way if you don't know how to
[00:05:55] assess your own Learning System it's
[00:05:58] obviously going to be very hard to
[00:05:59] upgrade it after all it took me probably
[00:06:02] at least 5,000 hours of studying and
[00:06:06] researching and experimentation to build
[00:06:08] my one and that was just a basic version
[00:06:11] so if you want to save yourself like
[00:06:12] months or even years of trial and error
[00:06:15] and introspection then I've already made
[00:06:18] a free quiz that only takes about 5
[00:06:21] minutes for you to complete and this
[00:06:22] quiz will actually map out for you your
[00:06:24] learning system and tell you which areas
[00:06:27] you should probably prioritize and why
[00:06:29] why it gives you actual scores and
[00:06:31] explanations so that you not only
[00:06:34] understand where you need to improve
[00:06:36] right now but you also learn how to
[00:06:39] think about a learning system moving
[00:06:41] forward only takes about 3 to 5 minutes
[00:06:43] it's completely free so I'll leave a
[00:06:45] link to it in the description so anyway
[00:06:47] this effort second approach is much
[00:06:49] better than the effort first approach
[00:06:51] which is pretty much just a recipe for
[00:06:52] Burnout but unfortunately the effort
[00:06:55] second approach is not necessarily going
[00:06:58] to stop you you from falling behind and
[00:07:02] feeling like you are losing control and
[00:07:04] getting less and less confident over
[00:07:06] time and this is where the infinite
[00:07:08] staircase comes in the infinite
[00:07:09] staircase explains why even the F second
[00:07:12] approach can still lead us to fall
[00:07:15] behind and why there is actually a third
[00:07:18] even better even safer approach what I
[00:07:21] explained to James was that there are
[00:07:23] two parts to the infinite staircase and
[00:07:26] these two parts give us two new ways
[00:07:30] of thinking about challenges that
[00:07:32] significantly increase our chances of
[00:07:35] overcoming the challenge consistently
[00:07:37] and confidently the first part is that
[00:07:41] challenges are infinite what I mean is
[00:07:43] that there's always another challenge
[00:07:46] when you're in school there's always
[00:07:47] another test and then there's uni and I
[00:07:50] know a lot of people think that after
[00:07:51] uni that like that's it but trust me
[00:07:54] life as a professional involves constant
[00:07:56] learning and constant challenges and
[00:07:58] those challenges usually have higher
[00:08:01] levels of consequences and yes you can
[00:08:03] just drop out of school and go live life
[00:08:06] as a Hermit and forage herbs and you
[00:08:08] know drink the rain water collected on a
[00:08:10] leaf but if you're even like mildly
[00:08:13] ambitious or career-driven the
[00:08:15] challenges do not stop avoiding
[00:08:19] challenges in life often means avoiding
[00:08:21] fulfillment and growth so that's the
[00:08:23] first part is that the challenges are
[00:08:26] infinite they do not end after this
[00:08:28] challenge there is then another one and
[00:08:30] then there is another one and then there
[00:08:32] is another one so if you're using that
[00:08:33] effort first approach then you are just
[00:08:36] going to get progressively more and more
[00:08:39] tired with every wave of Challenge and
[00:08:42] that's not sustainable I mean there's
[00:08:43] water coming into your boat and you are
[00:08:45] like desperately pedling and trying to
[00:08:47] like bucket water out at the same time
[00:08:49] and honestly you probably know that that
[00:08:52] is actually how it feels that feeling
[00:08:54] that if you stop trying so hard you will
[00:08:58] sink but if you keep trying just as hard
[00:09:01] you're going to burn out and then sink
[00:09:04] okay but what about the effort second
[00:09:06] approach I mean if we upgrade our boat
[00:09:09] with a like make a really good Learning
[00:09:11] System then we should be able to
[00:09:13] overcome each wave of challenge without
[00:09:16] needing so much effort why would we
[00:09:18] still fall behind or get burnt out the
[00:09:21] answer is because it doesn't work that
[00:09:24] way in reality and this is the second
[00:09:27] part of the infinite staircase the
[00:09:30] staircase just like how each step of a
[00:09:32] staircase takes us to a higher and
[00:09:35] higher level each subsequent wave of
[00:09:39] challenge tends to challenge us at a
[00:09:42] higher level and it's harder to overcome
[00:09:45] your exam next year is probably going to
[00:09:47] be harder than the one this year and
[00:09:49] then the one after that is going to be
[00:09:51] harder still and so on and so forth I
[00:09:54] remember when I got into medical school
[00:09:57] I thought there was like the Pinnacle of
[00:09:59] academic achievement and then when I
[00:10:01] went through medical school I realized
[00:10:03] man this is actually harder and then
[00:10:05] when I did Hospital placements it was
[00:10:08] you know even harder than that and by
[00:10:10] the time I was working as a doctor like
[00:10:12] getting into Medical School felt so easy
[00:10:15] compared to what I was trying to juggle
[00:10:17] and overcome then and the reason each
[00:10:19] wave felt harder is because at each
[00:10:23] level I was often competing against more
[00:10:26] capable people I often had more
[00:10:28] responsibility ities to juggle and the
[00:10:30] material itself was usually more
[00:10:33] complicated and nuanced the thing I
[00:10:34] realized was that challenges are often
[00:10:38] gateways to New Opportunities reserved
[00:10:41] only for those that can pass that
[00:10:44] challenge so by passing a challenge
[00:10:47] you're actually entering into a new
[00:10:50] level of difficulty and at the end of
[00:10:52] the day what that means is that if you
[00:10:55] use the effort second approach and you
[00:10:57] upgrade your boat to overcome this
[00:10:58] challenge there's no guarantee that
[00:11:01] you're going to be prepared for the next
[00:11:03] challenge or the next one after that and
[00:11:06] the thing I want you to understand is
[00:11:07] that feeling like you're falling behind
[00:11:10] is relative to the challenge so although
[00:11:13] upgrading our boat to overcome this
[00:11:15] challenge is going to help us now
[00:11:17] relative to the next challenge we're
[00:11:19] just going to fall behind all over again
[00:11:22] we get to celebrate overcoming this
[00:11:23] challenge for like a day before we have
[00:11:26] to face the dread and anxiety that maybe
[00:11:29] the next challenge is the one that's
[00:11:31] going to sink us and so now we have to
[00:11:33] upgrade our boat like again and again
[00:11:35] and again so the key is that getting
[00:11:39] ahead properly is about upgrading our
[00:11:41] boat so that it's not just suitable for
[00:11:44] this challenge but for the next 20 this
[00:11:47] is what lets you catch up get ahead and
[00:11:50] stay ahead this is what gives you like
[00:11:53] true confidence and mental freedom and
[00:11:56] so this is the third and best approach
[00:11:59] appro that we should take which I call
[00:12:01] the future proof approach with this we
[00:12:05] take the time to figure out what the
[00:12:08] next few upcoming challenges look like
[00:12:11] to figure out what are the skills and
[00:12:14] attributes and processes that we need to
[00:12:16] overcome not just this challenge but the
[00:12:18] next several and instead of upgrading
[00:12:20] our Learning System from like a level
[00:12:22] one to a level two we just go straight
[00:12:25] to level six or seven and by the way
[00:12:28] I'll give you some tips that I shared
[00:12:30] with James on how you can get started on
[00:12:32] this later but at this point James asked
[00:12:35] a very good question that you're
[00:12:37] probably already asking right now he
[00:12:39] said I've already been working on
[00:12:42] upgrading my learning system for months
[00:12:45] how am I meant to upgrade my system even
[00:12:49] more so that I can overcome not only
[00:12:51] this challenge uh but then you know the
[00:12:53] next few when I barely had enough time
[00:12:57] for this Challenge and the answer answer
[00:12:59] I gave him is that the cost of change is
[00:13:03] not linear the cost of change is how
[00:13:05] much it costs to change something so for
[00:13:08] James it was the hours and hours uh in
[00:13:12] Sleepless Nights Ty spin away from his
[00:13:14] loved ones on tinkering and
[00:13:16] experimenting and uh trying new
[00:13:18] techniques that's the cost he paid to
[00:13:21] change his Learning System and and
[00:13:23] upgrade his boat so when I say that the
[00:13:26] cost of change is not linear what I mean
[00:13:29] is that to go from level one to level
[00:13:33] six is not like five or six times the
[00:13:38] cost of going from level one to level
[00:13:40] two and this is the missing piece that
[00:13:44] 99% of the students and professionals
[00:13:46] that I work with don't understand which
[00:13:50] makes them fall behind in the first
[00:13:52] place when it comes to learning to learn
[00:13:53] and upgrading your Learning System
[00:13:55] there's always a cost of change it's
[00:13:57] unavoidable it's like P we can't
[00:14:00] magically improve overnight just by
[00:14:01] watching a few YouTube videos even my
[00:14:03] YouTube videos but the thing is that
[00:14:05] most of that cost of change is in
[00:14:09] unlearning our existing habits so if it
[00:14:12] takes like a 100 hours to upgrade your
[00:14:16] boat and improve your learning system
[00:14:18] like 80 of those hours is going to be
[00:14:21] spent on just realizing the habitual and
[00:14:26] subconscious mistakes that we make and
[00:14:28] then untraining ourselves from making
[00:14:32] them and it might take like another 20
[00:14:34] hours to learn a new set of techniques
[00:14:38] to upgrade our Learning System from a
[00:14:40] level one to a level two but it might
[00:14:42] take like only 30 hours to upgrade that
[00:14:46] to a level six so if you're already
[00:14:49] paying the cost of change to unlearn
[00:14:52] your current habits anyway why not spend
[00:14:57] a little bit more more time to upgrade
[00:15:01] your system all the way because remember
[00:15:04] if you don't you're going to have to pay
[00:15:06] that cost of change again and again and
[00:15:09] again for each new wave of challenge
[00:15:12] anyway and I think when I taught James
[00:15:14] this it really hit home because I
[00:15:17] remember teaching him this technique and
[00:15:20] he said that that technique would have
[00:15:23] directly stopped him from losing the
[00:15:26] marks that he lost in his recent exam
[00:15:29] which by the way those marks cost him
[00:15:33] his seat on the training program which
[00:15:34] means that he now needs to study for
[00:15:37] like another 8 months to try again next
[00:15:39] year and actually it was the same for me
[00:15:41] too I spent like 2 years upgrading my
[00:15:43] learning system in medical school
[00:15:45] thinking I was doing really well and
[00:15:46] then I entered into the hospital and I
[00:15:48] failed my first attachment because I had
[00:15:52] engineered a system of learning that was
[00:15:54] great for exams but kind of useless for
[00:15:56] real life and then I had to spend like I
[00:15:58] really stressful like 3 months to
[00:16:02] re-engineer my system to something that
[00:16:04] was better I could have just learned the
[00:16:07] proper One to begin with and I probably
[00:16:10] would have done even better in my first
[00:16:12] couple years of exams anyway so here's
[00:16:15] what you can do here's what I told James
[00:16:16] to do to get started on this future
[00:16:18] proof approach the first thing is to
[00:16:20] just figure out what your next few waves
[00:16:23] of challenges are going to look like
[00:16:25] talk to the people who have overcome or
[00:16:28] tried to over overcome those future
[00:16:30] challenges where did they trip up what
[00:16:32] mistakes did they make what were they
[00:16:33] surprised about what do they realize and
[00:16:35] be humble like you might think I'm not
[00:16:38] going to make those mistakes I'll be
[00:16:40] fine but hey they made those mistakes
[00:16:43] and they already succeeded at the
[00:16:46] challenge that you're currently trying
[00:16:47] to overcome so once you figure out what
[00:16:49] the next few rounds of challenges are
[00:16:51] going to look like you'll have a better
[00:16:52] idea at the full extent of the skills
[00:16:55] and processes and attributes that you
[00:16:56] need to work on and you can create a
[00:16:58] list priorities on what you think you
[00:17:00] should work on First and remember that
[00:17:02] quiz I made for you to get you started
[00:17:05] once you start realizing the true
[00:17:07] priorities based on a future proof
[00:17:10] approach it won't take you long to
[00:17:11] realize that not only is it helping you
[00:17:14] to overcome your next immediate
[00:17:16] challenge but it's going to help a lot
[00:17:19] with anxiety and apprehension because
[00:17:22] you are legitimately becoming the person
[00:17:25] who can succeed rather than kind of like
[00:17:27] feeling like an impos who's just barely
[00:17:30] hanging in there I feel this now myself
[00:17:33] and it's one of the feelings that I love
[00:17:35] helping my students achieve that feeling
[00:17:37] that you will not fall behind it doesn't
[00:17:41] matter what you're studying it doesn't
[00:17:42] matter how tough the competition is it
[00:17:45] doesn't matter how difficult the
[00:17:47] challenge is to know that you will be
[00:17:51] ahead because most people pay the cost
[00:17:55] of change constantly and there are very
[00:17:58] few people that are making that cost of
[00:18:01] change really worth it it's changed my
[00:18:04] life it's why I'm able to be here
[00:18:06] talking to you about this topic now I
[00:18:09] hope you find this video helpful as well
[00:18:11] thank you so much for watching and I'll
[00:18:12] see you in the next one


=== You’re Not Dumb: How to Mindmap as a Beginner ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLHqVR6VDUg

[00:00:00] mind maps are seriously powerful and I
[00:00:02] learned pretty much everything using
[00:00:04] them but a lot of people struggle
[00:00:06] getting started with mind mapping so if
[00:00:08] you've ever tried mind mapping and you
[00:00:10] found that it was overwhelming or you're
[00:00:12] just staring at a blank page not sure
[00:00:14] what to put down or you're even insecure
[00:00:16] about trying it then I'm going to tell
[00:00:18] you exactly why you feel that way and
[00:00:21] what you can do about it now I travel
[00:00:23] around the world delivering workshops on
[00:00:25] how to learn more effectively and mind
[00:00:27] mapping is a common technique that I'll
[00:00:29] teach and the way that I teach it now is
[00:00:31] actually very different to how I taught
[00:00:32] it 10 years ago 10 years ago I would
[00:00:35] just say here's how to my map go and do
[00:00:36] it and then 5 minutes later I'd look
[00:00:39] around and everyone has a blank page in
[00:00:41] front of them confused and they don't
[00:00:43] know where to start and at first it
[00:00:44] confused me because I'm literally giving
[00:00:46] step by step instructions on how to do
[00:00:49] the technique like why can't you just do
[00:00:51] it but then over the years I realized
[00:00:53] that there are two very common and
[00:00:56] Powerful mental barriers that people
[00:00:59] form over their academic lives that
[00:01:02] seriously hold them back and it's not
[00:01:04] just for mindmapping these mental
[00:01:05] barriers which are basically habits that
[00:01:07] we form will hold you back for pretty
[00:01:10] much any effective learning technique
[00:01:12] that you can ever learn so what are
[00:01:15] these mental barriers the first thing is
[00:01:17] that you have to trust your brain what
[00:01:20] does that mean okay imagine you're
[00:01:22] sitting there in a lecture most people
[00:01:24] if they're awake will just be listening
[00:01:27] sitting there and writing or typing down
[00:01:29] their notes constantly just listening
[00:01:31] and writing it down straight away like a
[00:01:33] human photocopier and if that's you then
[00:01:35] you're really going to struggle to learn
[00:01:38] more efficiently and I'll explain why in
[00:01:40] a sec but first here's a question for
[00:01:42] you if you write notes constantly while
[00:01:46] you are consuming new information why do
[00:01:48] you do that why don't you just listen to
[00:01:51] it first piece it all together think
[00:01:54] about it synthesize it and then output
[00:01:56] it in a nicely formatted organized set
[00:02:00] of notes the answer is that number one
[00:02:01] you probably don't know how and that
[00:02:03] seems really overwhelming and number two
[00:02:06] you don't trust your brain to be able to
[00:02:08] do that in the first place after all
[00:02:10] you've never been able to do that before
[00:02:12] and you might think that your memory is
[00:02:13] like a Civ so there's no reason to
[00:02:16] believe that your brain could hold on to
[00:02:18] all of that information put it all
[00:02:20] together nicely and then write a set of
[00:02:22] notes right at the end but this is a
[00:02:24] self-fulfilling prophecy and it's not a
[00:02:26] good prophecy the prophecy says you are
[00:02:28] going to struggle to learn forever
[00:02:30] because I want you to think about how
[00:02:31] learning actually works let's say I'm
[00:02:33] learning from this book if I just look
[00:02:35] at this book how much do you think I'm
[00:02:38] going to learn not a lot now what if I
[00:02:40] open the book and look at some pages am
[00:02:43] I learning now yeah probably not yet but
[00:02:46] what if I now read the words that are on
[00:02:48] the page am I learning now yeah a little
[00:02:51] bit more than before okay what if I now
[00:02:54] read the words think about them ask
[00:02:56] myself some questions and then go back
[00:02:58] to try to answer those questions
[00:03:00] flicking back and forth within the book
[00:03:01] to answer that and then write down my
[00:03:04] notes that summarize my thoughts
[00:03:06] obviously that last one will probably
[00:03:08] result in the most amount of learning
[00:03:10] and the key difference between those
[00:03:12] examples I just gave you is how much
[00:03:14] your brain is involved in that process
[00:03:18] so when we think about us reading
[00:03:20] something that information coming into
[00:03:23] our brain then us writing some notes
[00:03:25] about it learning is the part that
[00:03:28] happens in the mle middle in the gap
[00:03:31] between where information goes in and
[00:03:34] then comes out again in fact research
[00:03:36] tells us that writing notes immediately
[00:03:38] after listening or reading to something
[00:03:40] like at the same time makes us worse at
[00:03:43] learning and that's because this space
[00:03:45] and between information coming in and
[00:03:47] going out gets so so small that there's
[00:03:51] no opportunity for your brain to do any
[00:03:53] thinking in the first place so if you
[00:03:55] want information to come into your brain
[00:03:57] and stay in your brain then you have to
[00:04:00] actually let your brain in on the action
[00:04:03] you need to give it the time and the
[00:04:05] opportunity to think and pull it apart
[00:04:08] and ask questions and connect it all
[00:04:10] together again because your job as a
[00:04:12] learner isn't just to take information
[00:04:14] and document it for later your job as a
[00:04:17] learner is to take in information so
[00:04:21] that your brain can process it and
[00:04:24] honestly if all you're doing is reading
[00:04:26] something or listening to something
[00:04:28] writing some notes and then later going
[00:04:29] to reread and then rewrite those notes
[00:04:32] you are not letting your brain in on
[00:04:33] that process at any point unfortunately
[00:04:36] if you like most people spent 10 years
[00:04:39] just writing notes endlessly as your
[00:04:41] main form of studying and then someone
[00:04:43] like me tells you to stop doing that and
[00:04:46] try mind mapping instead that's going to
[00:04:48] feel uncomfortable it's different it's
[00:04:51] new it's unknown it can make you feel
[00:04:52] anxious and insecure what if it doesn't
[00:04:54] work what if you start with the wrong
[00:04:57] fact or concept what if you forget and
[00:04:59] you write down the wrong thing or what
[00:05:01] if you put down the wrong relationship
[00:05:03] or connection what if the world explodes
[00:05:05] you know all sorts of terrible things
[00:05:08] can start happening if you mindmap and
[00:05:10] if that's you and especially if you've
[00:05:11] been following my content for a while
[00:05:12] and you want to give mind mapping a go
[00:05:14] but you just feel like you don't know
[00:05:16] how to start then I want you to
[00:05:18] understand two things number one
[00:05:20] anything new is uncomfortable you either
[00:05:23] live with a discomfort of learning
[00:05:25] something new or you live with a
[00:05:27] discomfort of never learning and growing
[00:05:29] and number two it's actually not hard at
[00:05:32] all if you take it one step at a time so
[00:05:34] here's a couple of strategies that have
[00:05:36] worked really well for my students in
[00:05:38] the past to help them unlock their first
[00:05:40] proper effective mindmap first thing I
[00:05:42] call delayed note taking the concept to
[00:05:45] this is simple because learning happens
[00:05:47] inside the brain and if we just writing
[00:05:50] notes immediately as soon as that
[00:05:52] information comes in we're effectively
[00:05:54] bypassing the brain with delayed note
[00:05:57] taking we're just going to increase this
[00:05:59] space we're going to increase that Gap
[00:06:02] and give our brain more of an
[00:06:03] opportunity to jump in on the process
[00:06:05] how do we do that I literally just
[00:06:08] waiting and taking in more information
[00:06:10] before we write our notes for example
[00:06:12] let's say you normally write notes
[00:06:15] constantly and straight away then you'll
[00:06:17] be writing notes on a word for word
[00:06:20] basis as soon as someone says a word you
[00:06:22] write that word down and then would look
[00:06:23] something like this so here the lecturer
[00:06:25] would just be talking to you or you're
[00:06:28] watching a video or you're just reading
[00:06:29] a text book and you are just constantly
[00:06:32] writing writing the notes basically no
[00:06:35] gap between the information coming in
[00:06:37] and the information going out zero brain
[00:06:41] actually involved now here's what it
[00:06:42] would look like with a sentence level of
[00:06:45] delay we're first listening or we might
[00:06:47] be reading something uh and after a
[00:06:50] sentence then we're writing it down very
[00:06:53] quickly and then we're going to be
[00:06:55] listening again we're thinking about it
[00:06:56] and then we're writing it down again and
[00:06:59] again we're listening or reading and
[00:07:01] then we're writing it down again so you
[00:07:03] see there's more time spent in my brain
[00:07:06] and less time spent just on the keyboard
[00:07:08] we're creating a pause between the
[00:07:10] information coming in and the
[00:07:11] information going out and therefore
[00:07:12] we're introducing an opportunity for
[00:07:14] real learning to take place now the
[00:07:16] secret to making this actually helpful
[00:07:18] for you is that you have to activate
[00:07:20] this cognitive switch and this is
[00:07:22] important because this cognitive switch
[00:07:25] is actually crucial to do any form of
[00:07:28] effective learning especially mind m in
[00:07:30] fact I guarantee you talk to any top
[00:07:31] learner and they are already doing this
[00:07:34] cognitive switch without them even
[00:07:35] realizing it here's how this cognitive
[00:07:37] switch works when we add a small delay
[00:07:39] like just two or three sentences then
[00:07:43] our brain is in this juggle mode we're
[00:07:45] basically just trying to hold on to and
[00:07:48] juggle mentally all this new information
[00:07:51] that's coming and desperately try not to
[00:07:53] forget it until we can write it back
[00:07:55] down that's juggle mode and that kind of
[00:07:57] thinking is not helpful for learning
[00:07:59] it's not going to help you build a good
[00:08:01] memory and it's certainly not going to
[00:08:02] help you apply what you've learned but
[00:08:04] once that delay in our note taking
[00:08:06] starts widening even further really
[00:08:09] interesting thing starts happening in
[00:08:10] our brain this graph represents how long
[00:08:13] we delay our note taking for and then
[00:08:15] here on the left that's zero that's
[00:08:17] basically as soon as I hear it I'm
[00:08:18] writing it down again and then here on
[00:08:20] the right let's say this is you know a
[00:08:23] 10 minute delay which means that after I
[00:08:25] hear something new for the first time
[00:08:26] I'm actually holding on to that for 10
[00:08:28] minutes and continually consuming 10
[00:08:31] minutes worth of information before I'm
[00:08:32] writing it down and have a look at what
[00:08:34] happens to our mental effort and memory
[00:08:37] on the y axis so at first our effort
[00:08:40] involved in doing this is basically zero
[00:08:43] it's you know it's easy to do and our
[00:08:45] memory on this is almost zero as well
[00:08:47] this is extremely easy but also
[00:08:49] extremely useless now once we start
[00:08:51] delaying our note taking for a little
[00:08:53] longer like a few sentences what we'll
[00:08:55] find is that the amount of mental effort
[00:08:58] goes up a lot where in juggle mode we're
[00:09:00] trying to hold on to all of this new
[00:09:01] information before we can write it down
[00:09:03] again but remember I said juggle mode is
[00:09:06] not an efficient way for your brain to
[00:09:08] encode new information so even though
[00:09:10] the effort goes up rather rapidly our
[00:09:13] memory doesn't really go up by much at
[00:09:16] all now here's where it gets interesting
[00:09:17] because after we introduced a delay of
[00:09:20] more than let's say 1 or 2 minutes we're
[00:09:23] taking in so much new information that
[00:09:26] it's pretty much impossible for our bra
[00:09:29] to hold on to everything without
[00:09:31] forgetting it our effort is already
[00:09:33] going to be at its limit and we're going
[00:09:36] to be forgetting most of what we
[00:09:37] consumed during that time anyway so this
[00:09:40] situation which feels quite overwhelming
[00:09:41] is exactly where we want to put
[00:09:43] ourselves because this is what puts us
[00:09:45] into that cognitive switch from juggle
[00:09:49] mode into organizing mode and learning
[00:09:53] to think in this organizing mode is
[00:09:56] crucial to do any kind of effective
[00:09:58] learning in organizing mode we're not
[00:10:01] trying to hold on to every new piece of
[00:10:04] information and and juggle it in our in
[00:10:07] our brain so we're not going to forget
[00:10:09] it because it's impossible it's too much
[00:10:12] in organizing mode instead we're focused
[00:10:15] on trying to group it to simplify it to
[00:10:19] summarize it so that there are less
[00:10:22] individual things to hold on to we're
[00:10:24] transforming it into something that
[00:10:25] feels easier to remember and makes more
[00:10:28] sense and research Arch as well as my
[00:10:30] own observations from coaching thousands
[00:10:32] of people have shown that this process
[00:10:35] of organizing these separate facts and
[00:10:37] Concepts into groups is critical for
[00:10:40] forming stronger memory and deepening
[00:10:43] our ability to apply that knowledge it's
[00:10:45] kind of like folding and putting your
[00:10:48] clothes away instead of just trying to
[00:10:50] hold on to all of your laundry at once
[00:10:52] you know where to find your socks
[00:10:54] because they are logically in your sock
[00:10:56] drawer together in the same way your
[00:10:58] brain knows how to access certain
[00:11:00] information because it's been actively
[00:11:02] organized in a way that makes sense so
[00:11:04] if we look at this graph again once we
[00:11:06] flick into this organizing mode then our
[00:11:11] mental effort actually starts going down
[00:11:14] and we'll stay at this more reasonable
[00:11:17] level it's not going to drop to zero
[00:11:19] because you still have to spend effort
[00:11:21] on trying to find ways to group it and
[00:11:23] organize it together but it's a lot
[00:11:25] easier than just holding on to and
[00:11:27] trying to remember everything but more
[00:11:29] importantly our memory and our depth of
[00:11:32] understanding shoots up massively now an
[00:11:34] efficient learner can usually delay
[00:11:36] their note taking by around 5 minutes or
[00:11:39] more depending on how dense and
[00:11:41] complicated the information is however
[00:11:43] diligence is key it could literally take
[00:11:46] you years to delay your note taking by
[00:11:50] up to 3 to 5 minutes which is really the
[00:11:52] level that you want it to be if you want
[00:11:54] a chance at mastering mind mapping and
[00:11:56] in fact it's going to take so long that
[00:11:58] you're probably going to give up before
[00:11:59] before you actually crack it which means
[00:12:00] if you want to improve your memory and
[00:12:03] retain more and solve more complex
[00:12:05] problems and improve your performance
[00:12:07] and assessments without studying all day
[00:12:11] then you have to work on your learning
[00:12:14] skills
[00:12:15] consistant every week and even if you
[00:12:17] found me on YouTube today I worked on
[00:12:21] this every day for years just why to try
[00:12:24] to make this as easy as possible for you
[00:12:27] so that you don't have to spend every
[00:12:28] day for years I make videos like this
[00:12:31] but I also have a free newsletter it's
[00:12:34] called The Learning drops newsletter
[00:12:35] it's a completely free newsletter that
[00:12:37] you can sign up to and I'll email you
[00:12:40] every single week practical things that
[00:12:42] you can do to get better and faster at
[00:12:45] learning every single week the emails
[00:12:47] only take 3 to six minutes to read but
[00:12:49] they aim to save you hours per week in
[00:12:52] study time while improving your academic
[00:12:54] performance and without spending years
[00:12:57] to figure it out like I did I'll leave a
[00:12:58] link in the description if you want to
[00:12:59] join now if you give delayed not taking
[00:13:01] AO you're going to run into another
[00:13:03] problem which is that you don't have
[00:13:05] enough time to write your notes because
[00:13:08] if you're just listening and sitting
[00:13:10] there like listening or reading
[00:13:11] something for 5 or 10 minutes and then
[00:13:14] you are writing your notes then you need
[00:13:16] to write those notes very very quickly
[00:13:18] otherwise you're going to miss the next
[00:13:20] 5 minutes worth of stuff or if you're
[00:13:22] reading and it's a self-study session
[00:13:23] this study session is going to take you
[00:13:25] hours but if this happens to you then
[00:13:27] that's probably because of another bad
[00:13:30] habit that you have and this is the
[00:13:32] second major mental barrier which is the
[00:13:35] belief that writing more notes is better
[00:13:38] cuz for a lot of people there's a sense
[00:13:40] of security with writing lots of
[00:13:42] detailed comprehensive notes research
[00:13:45] actually shows that having longer
[00:13:47] wordier notes tends to reduce your
[00:13:49] academic performance and the reason is
[00:13:52] because of what I mentioned before if
[00:13:53] you have lots of notes it probably means
[00:13:55] you did more constant writing which
[00:13:57] means you actually thought about what to
[00:13:59] write less so on top of delaying your
[00:14:02] not taking I also want you to actively
[00:14:05] drop your word count by writing less not
[00:14:09] only does it save time but also forces
[00:14:11] you to think about another way that you
[00:14:13] can represent that same information
[00:14:16] which in turn forces us to think about
[00:14:19] the information more deeply and honestly
[00:14:21] rather than delaying the note taking
[00:14:22] it's this dropping the word count part
[00:14:25] that I found most people find more
[00:14:27] challenging and it's probably because
[00:14:29] writing lots of notes keeps you in the
[00:14:33] illusion of learning the illusion of
[00:14:35] learning is when we are doing things
[00:14:36] that make us feel like we're making
[00:14:38] progress when we're actually not for
[00:14:40] example I know a lot of people that buy
[00:14:42] a lot of like books or audio books and
[00:14:45] it just goes from like the delivery
[00:14:46] person to their shelf like they never
[00:14:48] even read it that is the illusion of
[00:14:50] learning you're doing something usually
[00:14:52] something very easy that feels like it's
[00:14:55] productive when it actually isn't making
[00:14:57] a difference to the the thing you're
[00:14:59] trying to improve writing notes is the
[00:15:01] same thing anyone can write a lot of
[00:15:03] notes and when you get to the end of a
[00:15:05] long study session and you've got 30
[00:15:07] pages of beautiful comprehensive notes
[00:15:09] you look at that and think wow that's so
[00:15:11] beautiful pet yourself in the back I've
[00:15:12] been so productive except that's a lie
[00:15:15] and we all know it because a week later
[00:15:17] we're probably going to forget half of
[00:15:18] it and we're not even going to read the
[00:15:19] other half again anyway but once we
[00:15:21] force ourselves to drop the word count
[00:15:24] it strips away the illusion of learning
[00:15:26] it's forcing us to engage with the proof
[00:15:29] process of learning directly if we
[00:15:31] struggle with that learning process it
[00:15:33] becomes painfully obvious because we can
[00:15:35] literally see it in our notes so to make
[00:15:37] it a little easier for you to escape
[00:15:39] this illusion of learning more
[00:15:41] successfully let me show you a
[00:15:43] stepbystep progression of what it would
[00:15:45] look like as you progressively drop your
[00:15:47] word count we start with your original
[00:15:49] notes that might look something like
[00:15:51] this so we're going to take the first
[00:15:53] step now of shortening it which is just
[00:15:55] reducing down some of those unnecessary
[00:15:58] sentences turning some of them into
[00:16:00] bullet points just just taking out
[00:16:02] unnecessary obvious filler
[00:16:10] words all righty and this is the
[00:16:12] simplified word drop version straight
[00:16:14] away just comparing it back and forth
[00:16:16] there's literally no useful information
[00:16:19] that was Stripped Away between the two
[00:16:20] versions here so that's the first step
[00:16:22] of dropping the word count so now what
[00:16:24] we're going to do is take the next step
[00:16:26] where we're not necessarily taking away
[00:16:28] more words but we're now seeing how we
[00:16:30] can start using spatial Arrangement some
[00:16:34] lines some basic arrows and connections
[00:16:37] to just express some of these obvious
[00:16:39] relationships and ideas without having
[00:16:41] to physically write it
[00:16:48] out and you can see at this point it's
[00:16:51] even simpler and again there's no useful
[00:16:54] information that was stripped away in
[00:16:55] fact I'd say that this final one is
[00:16:56] actually a little better at showing the
[00:16:59] relationships uh and showing the overall
[00:17:01] picture of how I should understand it
[00:17:03] you can see at a glance it's actually
[00:17:04] easier to see as well at this point you
[00:17:07] can see it's actually almost starting to
[00:17:10] naturally form a kind of mindmap so even
[00:17:13] though with each of these iterations
[00:17:14] there's less and less on the page
[00:17:18] there's more and more learning that is
[00:17:20] happening in the brain Less on the page
[00:17:23] more in the membrane this is how you're
[00:17:25] meant to create a mind map this kind of
[00:17:28] natural prog here most people when they
[00:17:30] think about doing a mind map they start
[00:17:31] with this big central theme on a page
[00:17:33] and all these things Branch out of it
[00:17:34] but that's not the point the a mind map
[00:17:36] is just a representation of the
[00:17:38] relationships and the connections that
[00:17:40] you discovered and synthesized based on
[00:17:43] thinking about how the information is
[00:17:46] related and can be grouped together and
[00:17:48] by getting to this point alongside some
[00:17:51] delayed note taking that's going to help
[00:17:53] you unlock a better memory which means
[00:17:56] that you're going to forget less of what
[00:17:57] you studied and better knowledge
[00:17:59] application which means that you can use
[00:18:01] what you've learned to solve more
[00:18:02] problems and do better in your exams so
[00:18:04] how long does it take to go from this
[00:18:06] here all the way through to this final
[00:18:08] version if you are a total beginner who
[00:18:11] has only done linear note taking before
[00:18:14] and you feeling really really insecure
[00:18:15] and uncomfortable about this it's going
[00:18:17] to take you probably one or two weeks if
[00:18:19] you are diligent with practicing it and
[00:18:21] from this point to get to a fully
[00:18:25] supercharged memory boosting mind map
[00:18:27] will take another two to six weeks with
[00:18:30] guidance or two to six months if you're
[00:18:32] doing it alone again it depends on how
[00:18:34] deep your old habits are and how
[00:18:35] diligently you practice if you want to
[00:18:37] make this all easier remember there's a
[00:18:38] link to my newsletter in the description
[00:18:40] which you can join for free I hope you
[00:18:42] found this helpful thank you so much for

=== How to Remember Everything You Read ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okHkUIW46ks

[00:00:00] in this video I'll teach you a system
[00:00:01] for remembering everything you read
[00:00:04] study or learn I've been using the
[00:00:06] system for the last 7 years starting
[00:00:09] from learning disease pathophysiology in
[00:00:11] medical school through to reading
[00:00:13] research articles and learning science
[00:00:16] or reading books on productivity or
[00:00:18] business and the reason the system works
[00:00:20] so consistently and so well is because
[00:00:23] it breaks down that process of reading
[00:00:24] into two distinct stages the first stage
[00:00:28] is the consumption
[00:00:31] period and the second stage is the
[00:00:34] digestion
[00:00:36] period most people think that by
[00:00:38] focusing on the first stage and
[00:00:40] consuming more information they'll be
[00:00:42] able to therefore remember and apply
[00:00:45] more information so they focus on trying
[00:00:47] to read faster or watching lectures at
[00:00:49] triple speed or binge listening to audio
[00:00:51] books or watching hours of YouTube
[00:00:53] tutorials but that is not how learning
[00:00:56] works and once we understand how
[00:00:58] learning does work you'll see why my
[00:01:01] system is so effective you see when it
[00:01:03] comes to remembering and applying
[00:01:05] information it's much less about what
[00:01:08] comes in to your brain and it's much
[00:01:10] more about how much stays in your brain
[00:01:14] and that is what the second stage the
[00:01:16] digestion period is all about and it's
[00:01:19] the part that is often neglected so
[00:01:21] teach you a system for mastering both of
[00:01:23] these stages which in turn increases
[00:01:26] your Aurora retention as well as your
[00:01:29] ability to actually use the knowledge in
[00:01:31] the way that you need to but first we
[00:01:33] need to ask ourselves is it even
[00:01:36] possible to remember everything you read
[00:01:39] and the short answer is no but here's
[00:01:43] the secret trying to remember everything
[00:01:47] we read should not be the goal in the
[00:01:51] first place and we know this because of
[00:01:53] a man who actually could remember
[00:01:55] everything this man's name is Kim Peak
[00:01:58] and his story is so crazy that Hollywood
[00:02:00] made an entire movie about him Kim Peak
[00:02:03] was a mega genius and his memory was
[00:02:06] ridiculous he was able to memorize a
[00:02:09] book with such perfect recall that after
[00:02:11] reading a book one time he would be able
[00:02:15] to write it out word for word with every
[00:02:19] comma and full stop back to front he
[00:02:23] memorized so many maps and atlases that
[00:02:26] he could give you driving directions
[00:02:28] between any two cities in the world and
[00:02:30] the path that he gave you was mentally
[00:02:33] calculated to be the shortest distance
[00:02:35] now the reason K had such supernatural
[00:02:37] abilities is because of a very rare
[00:02:39] medical condition he had called FG
[00:02:41] syndrome he was born with macroy which
[00:02:44] means he had a larger brain and he had
[00:02:47] no Corpus colossum which is basically
[00:02:49] the bundle of neurons that connect both
[00:02:52] hemispheres of the brain together in
[00:02:53] scientists believe that because he
[00:02:54] didn't have the normal pattern of
[00:02:56] neurons his brain adapted and developed
[00:02:59] Ved new connections to compensate which
[00:03:02] I guess gave him like superhuman memory
[00:03:05] now I want you to imagine that both you
[00:03:07] and Kim Peak were about to sit the same
[00:03:09] exam who do you think would do better
[00:03:12] and the answer is that it actually
[00:03:14] depends on the exam you see despite his
[00:03:17] superhuman memory Kim Peak struggled
[00:03:20] with reasoning and problem solving which
[00:03:23] means that if the exam was at the junior
[00:03:26] levels of schooling which often tests on
[00:03:28] the lower levels of of learning which
[00:03:30] involve a lot of memorization and recall
[00:03:33] then Kim Peak would definitely win but
[00:03:35] if the exam was at a higher level like
[00:03:37] University or postgraduate where the
[00:03:40] reasoning and problem solving the higher
[00:03:43] orders of learning are examined as a
[00:03:46] higher priority then you may actually
[00:03:49] have the edge now for most of you
[00:03:51] listening probably using the knowledge
[00:03:53] you have consumed to reason and problem
[00:03:56] solve is kind of the whole point of why
[00:03:58] you're trying to read and remember in
[00:04:00] the first place which basically means
[00:04:02] that it is not enough to remember
[00:04:06] everything which is good because for
[00:04:08] most people that's not possible anyway
[00:04:10] but it is possible to remember
[00:04:13] everything you need to remember in such
[00:04:16] a way that we can use that knowledge in
[00:04:20] the way we need to and that is what the
[00:04:22] system that I'll teach you helps you to
[00:04:24] achieve so to start using the system we
[00:04:27] have to understand that not all
[00:04:29] information is equal in fact I break
[00:04:32] down the information that I read into
[00:04:34] five different categories using the
[00:04:36] acronym
[00:04:38] Pacer and it's important to be able to
[00:04:40] identify which category the information
[00:04:43] you're reading to belongs to because for
[00:04:45] each category there are specific
[00:04:48] targeted processes that then help you to
[00:04:51] deal with and manage that information
[00:04:53] more effectively and when we use the
[00:04:55] wrong process for the specific category
[00:04:58] of information it makes remembering and
[00:05:01] understanding what you read much harder
[00:05:04] much more timec consuming and much less
[00:05:06] effective and that you're more likely to
[00:05:08] forget what you read it also increases
[00:05:10] the chance of you entering the passive
[00:05:12] mode of reading which is where you get
[00:05:14] to the bottom of a page and you can't
[00:05:15] even remember what you just read so the
[00:05:18] system goes like this in the first part
[00:05:20] where we are consuming information we
[00:05:23] want to identify which category what we
[00:05:27] are consuming belongs to using the Pacer
[00:05:31] acronym then during stage two we digest
[00:05:35] what we have read using the targeted
[00:05:38] process for that category which takes
[00:05:41] the information and stores it in our
[00:05:43] long-term memory through the process
[00:05:45] called encoding so let's go through
[00:05:47] Pacer together so that you can
[00:05:49] accurately identify the category of
[00:05:51] information you're trying to remember
[00:05:53] the p and Pacer stands for
[00:05:57] procedural and procedural information is
[00:05:59] any information that tells you how
[00:06:02] something should be executed for example
[00:06:05] this is a book that I used during
[00:06:06] medical school that taught me about how
[00:06:09] to do a clinical examination like listen
[00:06:11] to a heartbeat or take someone's blood
[00:06:13] pressure and a lot of the information in
[00:06:15] this book is about the correct technique
[00:06:18] to perform the examination and some
[00:06:20] subjects and domains have a lot of
[00:06:23] procedural information some great
[00:06:25] examples of this would be coding and
[00:06:27] languages the targeted process for
[00:06:29] working with with and mastering this
[00:06:31] type of procedural information is
[00:06:34] practice the key is that you want to
[00:06:37] apply procedural information in real
[00:06:40] life as early as possible a lot of
[00:06:43] people will spend time to read it and
[00:06:45] memorize it and write lots of notes
[00:06:47] about it and then a week or two later
[00:06:49] they'll try to practice it but by then
[00:06:52] it's too late we've already forgotten a
[00:06:53] lot of it and a lot of that time is just
[00:06:56] wasted instead as soon as you take that
[00:06:58] procedural information into your brain
[00:07:01] try to apply it and practice it as early
[00:07:03] as you can now straight away we run into
[00:07:07] a problem with using this approach what
[00:07:10] if we're reading something and we don't
[00:07:12] have time to practice it right now the
[00:07:14] answer is you either move on to
[00:07:17] something else or you stop consuming
[00:07:21] anything and you wait until you have
[00:07:24] time to practice it but you do not waste
[00:07:26] your time trying to just memor memorize
[00:07:29] it on the spot because here is the
[00:07:31] crucial part about learning that
[00:07:33] everyone overlooks the two stages of
[00:07:36] consuming and digesting must always be
[00:07:43] balanced everything you consume must be
[00:07:46] digested in order for you to retain and
[00:07:49] use it only when stage one is followed
[00:07:53] by stage two does learning actually
[00:07:57] occur if we're reading something and we
[00:07:59] don't have time time to use the right
[00:08:00] process like practice then most people
[00:08:02] will say oh well I don't have time right
[00:08:04] now I'm just going to get through as
[00:08:06] much of it as I can and they spend more
[00:08:08] time reading and reading and essentially
[00:08:10] just consuming more and more but this is
[00:08:14] the learning equivalent of overeating
[00:08:16] they haven't had a chance to digest it
[00:08:17] so they're just going to end up vomiting
[00:08:19] it all up again through the mental
[00:08:22] vomiting process we call forgetting
[00:08:23] which is why for most people the amount
[00:08:26] that they forget after reading is
[00:08:28] extremely high with some studies
[00:08:31] suggesting that up to
[00:08:33] 90% of what is consumed is forgotten
[00:08:37] despite hours of consuming and if we're
[00:08:40] forgetting 90% of what we read rather
[00:08:43] than consuming more and taking time away
[00:08:47] from the digesting it actually makes
[00:08:49] more sense to spend less time consuming
[00:08:53] and more time on the digesting and
[00:08:56] processing this increases your retention
[00:08:59] with which therefore increases the
[00:09:02] amount of working knowledge you're able
[00:09:04] to build so earlier I said what goes
[00:09:07] into your brain is less important than
[00:09:09] what stays in your brain and this
[00:09:11] principle of balancing stage one
[00:09:13] consuming with stage two digesting is
[00:09:16] important not just for procedural
[00:09:18] information but for every other category
[00:09:21] of PESA unfortunately stage two
[00:09:24] digesting is almost completely neglected
[00:09:27] for the second category of in the a of
[00:09:30] Pacer which stands for
[00:09:35] analogous analogous information is
[00:09:37] actually one of the easiest types of
[00:09:40] information to work with and remember
[00:09:43] and apply because analogous information
[00:09:47] is the information that is related to
[00:09:50] something you already have prior
[00:09:53] knowledge about and even if we don't
[00:09:55] have direct prior knowledge about it it
[00:09:58] may remind us indirectly of something
[00:10:01] that we do have knowledge about for
[00:10:03] example let's say that we are an avid
[00:10:05] swimmer and we're learning about the
[00:10:08] physiology of a muscle contraction when
[00:10:10] we look at that muscle contraction cycle
[00:10:13] we might think hey that reminds me a lot
[00:10:16] about the swimming technique I use and
[00:10:19] by connecting the new information about
[00:10:22] muscle contraction physiology with what
[00:10:25] we already know our swimming technique
[00:10:28] we have created
[00:10:29] an analogy and so that is analogous
[00:10:32] information and analogies can form with
[00:10:35] any prior knowledge including knowledge
[00:10:38] within a topic itself in most fields of
[00:10:41] study there are Concepts or patterns of
[00:10:44] Concepts and relationships that tend to
[00:10:47] repeat and recur throughout that field
[00:10:50] you might have learned about how to
[00:10:51] solve a particular type of problem last
[00:10:53] semester and now this semester this new
[00:10:56] problem solving approach that you're
[00:10:57] learning for the first time reminds you
[00:10:59] a lot of that old problem solving
[00:11:02] process and relating those two
[00:11:04] approaches is also an analogy so when
[00:11:06] we're engaging in stage one the
[00:11:09] consumption period of reading we want to
[00:11:12] actively be thinking about whether what
[00:11:14] we are reading is related to something
[00:11:18] that we already have knowledge about and
[00:11:20] once we identify it as potentially
[00:11:22] analogous information the targeted
[00:11:25] process we want to use here is critique
[00:11:30] this is the part I said everyone misses
[00:11:32] once we create an analogy critiquing it
[00:11:36] means we examine critically how good
[00:11:39] that analogy actually is for example
[00:11:42] with the analogy of muscle contraction
[00:11:44] and swimming technique critiquing that
[00:11:46] analogy means asking ourselves in what
[00:11:49] way specifically are these two things
[00:11:52] similar or related to each other in what
[00:11:55] ways are they different in what
[00:11:58] situation does this analogy not make
[00:12:00] sense anymore and if there are a lot of
[00:12:02] differences or a lot of conditions and
[00:12:04] situations where the analogy breaks
[00:12:06] apart then is there a better analogy or
[00:12:09] can we extend or modify that analogy to
[00:12:12] make it more comprehensive and more
[00:12:14] accurate this critiquing process
[00:12:16] massively drives up our attention and
[00:12:19] depth of understanding of this new
[00:12:21] information and the reason this works is
[00:12:23] because instead of new information just
[00:12:25] being new information that your brain
[00:12:28] doesn't know what to do with we're
[00:12:29] actually extending it from what we
[00:12:32] already know we're taking our existing
[00:12:34] Network and connecting it to the new
[00:12:37] information straight away which is the
[00:12:39] reason why creating analogies has been
[00:12:41] shown in studies repeatedly to be so
[00:12:44] powerful for our retention and
[00:12:46] understanding now at this point you
[00:12:47] might be looking at the system and
[00:12:49] thinking this seems a little forced it
[00:12:52] doesn't feel natural and you're right in
[00:12:54] fact it's crucial that you understand
[00:12:57] that this is not natural and that's why
[00:13:01] it works if you have no time pressure
[00:13:04] and it doesn't matter how well you learn
[00:13:06] something then you can learn and read
[00:13:08] however you want but unfortunately what
[00:13:11] research has shown is that there are
[00:13:13] clear biological limitations of the
[00:13:16] human brain to how much it can consume
[00:13:19] and store into our memory in one go and
[00:13:22] in the modern day when there is so much
[00:13:24] we have to learn it is very very easy to
[00:13:28] exceed that biological limit and then
[00:13:30] get overwhelmed learning is extremely
[00:13:33] complicated so to be able to learn a lot
[00:13:36] in a short amount of time reach a high
[00:13:37] level of knowledge a lot of processes
[00:13:40] need to go right and this is why most
[00:13:43] people will Plateau on their learning
[00:13:45] ability and after a point not really
[00:13:48] improve for the rest of their lives for
[00:13:50] me figuring out what processes to care
[00:13:52] about and therefore what to improve on
[00:13:55] and then how to even execute on those
[00:13:59] correctly took me at least 7 or 8 years
[00:14:02] of almost constant experimentation and
[00:14:06] reading of research and coaching people
[00:14:09] to see what works for them and honestly
[00:14:11] I got lucky because 10 15 years ago a
[00:14:13] lot of the research didn't even exists
[00:14:15] which is why to make it easier for you
[00:14:18] I've started a free Weekly Newsletter I
[00:14:21] take everything that I've learned that
[00:14:23] helps you become a more efficient
[00:14:24] learner the things that have the highest
[00:14:26] chance of giving you success in a short
[00:14:29] amount of time and I packaged them in a
[00:14:31] way that you can take and Implement into
[00:14:34] your own learning in less than 10 15
[00:14:36] minutes if you want to sign up to the
[00:14:37] newsletter it's completely free I'll
[00:14:38] leave a link in the description for you
[00:14:40] now getting back to peser you might
[00:14:42] notice that the way that I've written
[00:14:44] the a in PESA is is like this it's this
[00:14:48] kind of strange shape there the reason
[00:14:50] is because a the analogous information
[00:14:54] can exist within as a subset of
[00:14:59] procedural information for example you
[00:15:01] could create an analogy on a set of
[00:15:04] instructions to make it simpler and
[00:15:06] easier for you to understand and then
[00:15:07] later you go and practice it but
[00:15:09] analogous information also exists as a
[00:15:11] subset within the next category of
[00:15:14] information which is the C of Paca and
[00:15:17] this stands for
[00:15:19] conceptual if procedural information is
[00:15:22] the how to do something then conceptual
[00:15:25] information is the what and for most
[00:15:27] science subjects the majority of what
[00:15:29] you need to learn is conceptual
[00:15:31] conceptual information includes facts
[00:15:33] and explanations theories and principles
[00:15:37] relationships between Concepts and ways
[00:15:40] that that concept can be applied and in
[00:15:42] most cases we need both the procedural
[00:15:44] and the conceptual knowledge to solve a
[00:15:47] problem and apply our knowledge properly
[00:15:49] for example although this book goes
[00:15:51] through how to listen to someone's heart
[00:15:55] I still need to have the conceptual
[00:15:58] knowledge about what I'm listening to to
[00:16:00] be able to analyze that and make a
[00:16:02] conclusion on the diagnosis so when we
[00:16:05] identify that a piece of text we're
[00:16:06] reading is conceptual type information
[00:16:09] the process we want to use straight away
[00:16:11] is
[00:16:13] mapping
[00:16:14] nonlinear network based note taking such
[00:16:18] as mind mapping is an efficient way of
[00:16:21] increasing your attention and Mastery of
[00:16:24] conceptual knowledge because conceptual
[00:16:26] knowledge inherently exists in a network
[00:16:29] although a textbook or a lecture might
[00:16:31] be delivered word after word in a linear
[00:16:34] format if we look at the mind and
[00:16:37] knowledge of the person that wrote that
[00:16:39] textbook it doesn't exist in a linear
[00:16:43] sentence by sentence structure their
[00:16:45] knowledge and expertise exists in a
[00:16:47] highly connected network of information
[00:16:51] there is no innate sequence of
[00:16:53] information an expert can start at any
[00:16:56] point and navigate to any other point
[00:16:59] this is what allows an expert to do
[00:17:01] complex problem solving because they can
[00:17:03] look at a problem understand what
[00:17:05] concepts are related and see how those
[00:17:08] Concepts connect together to solve the
[00:17:11] problem whereas a beginner who's only
[00:17:12] learned it at a surface level just sees
[00:17:15] individual separated Concepts and they
[00:17:18] don't understand how they link together
[00:17:21] as a learner our job is not to remember
[00:17:24] the sequence word for word our job is to
[00:17:26] try to recreate that network of
[00:17:30] knowledge that the expert had and
[00:17:31] mapping is such a great technique
[00:17:33] because it forces us to not only think
[00:17:36] about each fact and concept but also how
[00:17:39] they connect to each other to form a
[00:17:42] bigger picture so when you are reading
[00:17:44] and consuming take some time to get out
[00:17:48] a piece of paper or a tablet and make a
[00:17:51] map of the things that you're learning
[00:17:53] and as you read more you add more to
[00:17:57] your map you move things around you
[00:17:59] reorganize things as you read more you
[00:18:03] also digest more and your map grows
[00:18:06] remember analogous information can also
[00:18:09] exist within conceptual information so
[00:18:12] you might find Opportunities within
[00:18:14] conceptual information to create some
[00:18:16] analogies and you might want to add
[00:18:18] those into your map as well even if the
[00:18:20] analogy doesn't make its way into the
[00:18:21] map it could give you an idea in terms
[00:18:23] of how you want to structure your ideas
[00:18:26] on your map now here's that same problem
[00:18:28] again let's say you reading but you
[00:18:30] don't have time to draw a map or maybe
[00:18:33] you don't have anything to map on while
[00:18:35] you're reading then again we need to
[00:18:37] slow down and consume less so that
[00:18:40] consumption and digestion can stay
[00:18:42] balanced and if you don't you'll just
[00:18:45] end up overwhelmed again and wasting
[00:18:47] time because not only are you going to
[00:18:50] forget a lot of what you are consuming
[00:18:53] but now you've given the future version
[00:18:55] of you more work to do by having to go
[00:18:57] and figure out what your forgotten and
[00:18:59] then Rec consume it again anyway now the
[00:19:02] good news is that the digesting of
[00:19:04] procedural analogous and conceptual
[00:19:06] information is easily the most timec
[00:19:09] consuming the E and the r of PESA are
[00:19:12] much faster and easier to deal with I
[00:19:14] talk about e and are together because
[00:19:15] they're both very similar to each other
[00:19:18] but pay close attention because the two
[00:19:20] are actually so similar to each other
[00:19:23] that most people never distinguish
[00:19:26] between the two and that can lead
[00:19:28] directly to hours of wasted time per
[00:19:31] week the E and Pacer stands for
[00:19:35] evidence evidence type information is
[00:19:37] the information that helps make
[00:19:40] conceptual information more concrete
[00:19:43] they're often very detailed sometimes
[00:19:45] very technical pieces of information but
[00:19:48] they're useful because we can use these
[00:19:51] facts or statistics or cases as examples
[00:19:55] to prove a conceptual point for example
[00:19:58] we could understand
[00:20:00] conceptually how World War I started but
[00:20:04] we also need to know the evidence
[00:20:06] information of date certain specific
[00:20:09] events occurred between which specific
[00:20:12] people at which specific location to
[00:20:15] make that concept more concrete and the
[00:20:18] key process for evidence type
[00:20:20] information is to
[00:20:22] store and
[00:20:25] rehearse store means that you just colle
[00:20:28] collect that information and note it
[00:20:30] down somewhere you could add it to your
[00:20:33] conceptual map you could add it to a
[00:20:35] second brain system using something like
[00:20:37] notion or Rome or obsidian or you can
[00:20:40] put it onto flashcards you could even
[00:20:43] just write them down on a document
[00:20:45] somewhere with all the other things that
[00:20:46] you are storing this should happen as
[00:20:48] soon as you identify it so as you are
[00:20:51] consuming the information and you
[00:20:53] identify that this piece of information
[00:20:56] is an Evidence type we go ahead and
[00:20:59] straight away store it the rehearsing
[00:21:02] part of it comes a little later we put
[00:21:05] aside time to do the rehearsal and
[00:21:07] rehearsing the information is the key to
[00:21:11] improving our retention of evidence type
[00:21:13] information rehearsing means that we
[00:21:15] think about how we will need to use this
[00:21:19] piece of information how are we going to
[00:21:21] apply it what type of conceptual
[00:21:23] information is this an example of we
[00:21:25] then challenge ourselves by using an
[00:21:28] applying that information in the way
[00:21:30] that we will need to use it this means
[00:21:33] solving problems or writing detailed
[00:21:35] answers to questions or creating
[00:21:36] explanations teaching it to other people
[00:21:39] or maybe writing essays that use that
[00:21:41] piece of evidence as a supporting
[00:21:44] example for a wider concept and so while
[00:21:46] we store the information while we
[00:21:49] consume it the rehearsing happens later
[00:21:52] maybe at the end of the day or at the
[00:21:53] end of the week but do not waste time
[00:21:57] while you are cons assuming trying to
[00:22:00] just memorize and read and reread and
[00:22:03] writing copious notes on that piece of
[00:22:05] information otherwise you are not going
[00:22:07] to have enough time for the PA and C the
[00:22:11] first three types of information which
[00:22:13] is what forms the foundation of
[00:22:16] knowledge that the evidence type needs
[00:22:19] to build off of in the first place now
[00:22:22] evidence type information is very
[00:22:24] similar to the final type which is the r
[00:22:26] of PESA and this stands for
[00:22:29] reference type information reference
[00:22:31] information is the easiest to deal with
[00:22:34] it is all of the Nitty Gritty very
[00:22:37] specific detailed bits of information
[00:22:40] that don't really change your conceptual
[00:22:44] understanding they're not particularly
[00:22:47] that important they're not analogous and
[00:22:49] they're not procedural but for whatever
[00:22:51] reason we might need to know this later
[00:22:55] this might be something like the exact
[00:22:56] value of a mathematical con Conant or a
[00:22:59] specific Gene involved in a particular
[00:23:01] mutation or the name of a very specific
[00:23:03] molecule of a disease or maybe a list of
[00:23:06] attributes used to define a variable for
[00:23:09] coding and the process we use to deal
[00:23:12] with this type of information is the
[00:23:13] same as for evidence almost it's store
[00:23:18] and rehearse the same
[00:23:21] things the storing part exactly the same
[00:23:25] you Chuck it in a second brand and your
[00:23:26] flash cards wherever makes sense for you
[00:23:29] but if you need to be able to record
[00:23:30] this information from memory and you
[00:23:32] can't like refer back to your notes when
[00:23:35] you need to use it then you probably
[00:23:36] want to use something like flash cards
[00:23:38] because the rehearse part is a little
[00:23:40] different because reference type
[00:23:42] information is by definition not very
[00:23:46] conceptually important anyway it's quite
[00:23:49] hard to use this for problem solving or
[00:23:52] as part of like an extended discussion
[00:23:54] or answer the way we're probably going
[00:23:56] to use this information is just Direct
[00:23:58] fact recoil which is why something like
[00:24:01] flash cards using a space repetition
[00:24:03] active recoil strategy like an app like
[00:24:06] ankey is going to be the best way to
[00:24:08] handle reference type information so as
[00:24:11] you're reading and you're thinking hey
[00:24:13] this might be a reference type
[00:24:14] information you dump it into your
[00:24:17] flashcards and you put aside like 30
[00:24:20] minutes every day or whatever to just go
[00:24:22] through your flash cards to do your
[00:24:24] rehearsal but please again
[00:24:26] absolutely do not waste time while
[00:24:30] you're reading trying to just read and
[00:24:32] reread and write notes and just memorize
[00:24:34] this information at the time you need to
[00:24:37] use that time for the first three which
[00:24:40] forms the bulk of your knowledge as I
[00:24:43] said earlier there are a lot of things
[00:24:45] that need to go right to be able to
[00:24:47] learn a lot of information in a short
[00:24:49] period of time and wasting time on
[00:24:52] trying to memorize reference information
[00:24:54] while you are reading it instead of
[00:24:56] spending that time on the first three
[00:24:59] types is one of the worst offenders and
[00:25:02] as soon as you get into that mind frame
[00:25:04] of reading something and then rereading
[00:25:07] it again trying to get it into your head
[00:25:09] you can say goodbye to your learning
[00:25:11] efficiency so now you know the five
[00:25:13] types of information for you to try to
[00:25:15] identify as you consume in stage one and
[00:25:19] the appropriate targeted process that
[00:25:21] will help you to digest that information
[00:25:23] in stage two and the key to be able to
[00:25:26] retain a lot and have a good high level
[00:25:29] of knowledge for what you have consumed
[00:25:31] is to keep that stage one and stage two
[00:25:33] balanced however when it comes to
[00:25:35] learning efficiently this just scratches
[00:25:38] the surface in fact if you look at this
[00:25:41] map of learning that outlines the major
[00:25:44] processes that you need to be a
[00:25:46] consistently High performing efficient
[00:25:49] learner what we talked about today is
[00:25:51] like barely a few percent of it so if
[00:25:54] you want to start unpacking what those
[00:25:55] other processes look like without having
[00:25:57] to dedicate
[00:25:59] a decade of your life to uh learning
[00:26:01] about it like I did then make sure to
[00:26:03] check out my free newsletter the link is

=== How to Force Your Brain To Be Motivated (when you don’t feel like it) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMB3NsQotvM

[00:00:00] I have this four-step method that I use
[00:00:03] to stay motivated and get stuff done
[00:00:06] especially on the days where I feel
[00:00:07] tired or lazy or even burnt out over the
[00:00:11] past 11 years I have been working 60 to
[00:00:14] 100 hours a week studying full-time
[00:00:17] graduating medicine starting my own
[00:00:19] business working as a learning coach
[00:00:21] while working as a doctor and most
[00:00:23] people think I am highly motivated but
[00:00:25] honestly I think I'm a pretty lazy
[00:00:28] person and I've been demotivated and
[00:00:31] burnt out more times than I can count
[00:00:33] but by using this four-step method I've
[00:00:35] been able to stay productive and work
[00:00:37] towards my goal in a way that is
[00:00:40] actually sustainable and mentally
[00:00:42] healthy I call this four-step method
[00:00:45] defuse because by following each of
[00:00:48] these four steps you're able to activate
[00:00:50] something called thought action defusion
[00:00:53] which is a cognitive technique commonly
[00:00:55] used in Clinical Psychology being able
[00:00:57] to activate thought action defusion is
[00:01:00] almost like a superpower and virtually
[00:01:02] anyone can learn to do it I'll go over
[00:01:04] each of the four steps of defuse in more
[00:01:06] detail but before that we need to
[00:01:09] understand that there are actually two
[00:01:11] different ways that we can use
[00:01:13] motivation one of them is healthy and
[00:01:15] productive but the other much more
[00:01:18] common way can actually ruin our
[00:01:20] productivity and lead to burnout and
[00:01:22] once we understand the right versus
[00:01:24] wrong way of using motivation you'll see
[00:01:26] why the defuse method works so well so
[00:01:29] let's say that we have a goal for the
[00:01:31] day and that goal might be to go for a
[00:01:33] run it might be to do some study or
[00:01:36] whatever other task that you have on
[00:01:38] your mind naturally in order for us to
[00:01:40] accomplish this goal we first need to
[00:01:42] want to accomplish it and that's where
[00:01:44] we have intention and after that we take
[00:01:46] a series of actions to help us reach
[00:01:50] that goal now if our goal was to uh go
[00:01:53] for a run it might be putting on our
[00:01:55] shoes if it was to study it might be
[00:01:57] going to our desk opening up our laptop
[00:01:59] getting our textbook out starting to
[00:02:02] read and write some notes these are the
[00:02:04] actions that help us achieve the goal
[00:02:05] but in reality what actually happens
[00:02:09] when we try to reach the goal what
[00:02:11] happens is that we get
[00:02:13] distracted we procrastinate or maybe we
[00:02:16] start feeling lazy or tired so between
[00:02:19] the intention and our first few actions
[00:02:22] all of these barriers start forming that
[00:02:25] stop us from achieving our goal which
[00:02:26] means no running no studying task
[00:02:29] incomplete that is where motivation
[00:02:31] comes in motivation gives us that extra
[00:02:34] energy the extra incentive to overcome
[00:02:37] these barriers to peel our eyes away
[00:02:39] from those distractions to uh persevere
[00:02:42] and push through even though we feel
[00:02:44] lazy or that we feel tired at the end of
[00:02:46] the day motivation is this feeling that
[00:02:49] allows us to push through and overcome
[00:02:52] these barriers this is the first and
[00:02:55] most common way that people use
[00:02:58] motivation and that is a major problem
[00:03:03] because this way of using motivation is
[00:03:05] something that I call
[00:03:07] motivation dependent and before I go
[00:03:10] through the defuse method you have to
[00:03:12] understand why this is such a problem
[00:03:15] because I genuinely believe that if you
[00:03:17] are motivation dependent you will
[00:03:19] struggle to get stuff done for most of
[00:03:23] your life because here's the fundamental
[00:03:25] flaw with motivation that you need to
[00:03:28] know there's a lot of research around
[00:03:29] motiv a what it is where it comes from
[00:03:32] what influences it if you want me to go
[00:03:34] deeper in this let me know in the
[00:03:35] comments but what we know is that
[00:03:37] motivation originates from many
[00:03:40] different sources we can be
[00:03:42] extrinsically motivated by things like
[00:03:44] money a reward social status or even
[00:03:48] fear of punishment but we can also be
[00:03:50] intrinsically motivated which is where
[00:03:53] the motivation comes from within our own
[00:03:55] mind this includes things like a sense
[00:03:57] of satisfaction from fulfilling
[00:03:59] something or a sense of purpose and
[00:04:02] fulfillment from doing something that
[00:04:04] feels aligned to your values and sense
[00:04:07] of identity and it includes also just
[00:04:09] simply enjoying the task itself and here
[00:04:13] is where being motivation dependent
[00:04:16] becomes problematic and therefore why
[00:04:19] the defuse method is so much better see
[00:04:22] extrinsic motivators tend to be out of
[00:04:24] our control and they go up and down for
[00:04:27] example what happens if we get paid paid
[00:04:30] less or more or we're around different
[00:04:32] people to compare ourselves to or we're
[00:04:35] around different people who value
[00:04:37] different things and so they judge you
[00:04:39] differently when we are motivated by
[00:04:42] those extrinsic things then our
[00:04:44] motivation fluctuates wildly it feels
[00:04:47] unstable and insecure because they
[00:04:50] depend on things that we can't control
[00:04:51] on the other hand intrinsic motivators
[00:04:53] tend to be more stable for example our
[00:04:56] values or the things that we enjoy don't
[00:04:59] tend to FL uate so rapidly but even
[00:05:02] intrinsic motivators can fluctuate for
[00:05:05] example how much sleep we get and how
[00:05:07] energized we feel our mood on that day
[00:05:10] or our physical health all of these
[00:05:13] things affect our level of motivation on
[00:05:16] any given day so why is that actually a
[00:05:19] problem well what all of that means is
[00:05:22] that our motivation is always going to
[00:05:25] go up and down it's always going to
[00:05:28] fluctuate and if you're AB ility to get
[00:05:30] stuff done depends on your motivation
[00:05:34] then your ability to be productive is
[00:05:36] also going to fluctuate and if what you
[00:05:39] do depends on how you feel then the only
[00:05:42] way to be consistent is to feel
[00:05:46] consistently great that is not a
[00:05:48] realistic or a reliable way to reach our
[00:05:51] goals in fact there's even some research
[00:05:53] around something called willpower
[00:05:54] depletion which says that if we
[00:05:56] consistently rely on our motivation and
[00:05:58] willpower to get stuff done and resist
[00:06:01] Temptations then eventually we'll sort
[00:06:04] of run out of willpower and some
[00:06:06] researchers think that this is actually
[00:06:08] what burnout is they call it the burnout
[00:06:11] cycle where you constantly try to do
[00:06:13] something and then you have to have more
[00:06:15] and more effort and willpower to get it
[00:06:17] done and then you're constantly
[00:06:18] overcoming barriers until there's no
[00:06:20] more motivation or energy left to give
[00:06:23] so what is the alternative way of using
[00:06:25] motivation the alternative much
[00:06:27] healthier and more consistent way of
[00:06:29] using motivation is something that I
[00:06:31] call motivation enhanced and becoming
[00:06:35] motivation enhanced rather than
[00:06:36] motivation dependent is what the entire
[00:06:38] defuse method is based on being
[00:06:41] motivation enhanced means that you can
[00:06:43] be motivated but you don't need to be
[00:06:47] personally I don't feel motivated most
[00:06:51] days I don't feel demotivated but I just
[00:06:54] don't live every day like full of hype I
[00:06:57] keep that motivation in reserve on the
[00:07:00] days that I really need to use it
[00:07:02] instead of just using it to get through
[00:07:05] my daily tasks then how am I overcoming
[00:07:08] those barriers of laziness or being
[00:07:11] distracted or feeling tired on a daily
[00:07:13] basis we do it by following the four
[00:07:15] steps of the defuse method the first
[00:07:18] step of Defuse The D is for distinguish
[00:07:22] distinguish means to recognize the
[00:07:24] difference between
[00:07:27] feelings thoughts
[00:07:31] and
[00:07:32] actions for example think about when you
[00:07:35] feel hungry hunger is a physical
[00:07:38] sensation it's a feeling and when we
[00:07:40] feel hunger we have the thought I must
[00:07:46] eat and then we perform the action of
[00:07:49] eating and normally all three of these
[00:07:53] are actually fused together but they
[00:07:55] don't have to be we could feel hunger as
[00:07:59] okay I just feel this sensation in my
[00:08:03] stomach that tells me that I am hungry
[00:08:05] we just notice that we don't have to act
[00:08:08] on it we just notice it just like how we
[00:08:10] might notice that there's a breeze
[00:08:12] touching our arm and by doing that we
[00:08:14] can see Hunger as a physical Sensation
[00:08:17] that isn't always connected to the
[00:08:20] thought I must eat and that actually
[00:08:23] makes the feeling of hunger not bother
[00:08:25] us as much because we no longer have to
[00:08:28] do something about it this is actually
[00:08:29] strategy I used to use all the time as a
[00:08:31] doctor where I'd often not have enough
[00:08:33] time to have lunch or dinner but I still
[00:08:36] needed to work effectively now of course
[00:08:38] it this is temporary you will eventually
[00:08:41] have to eat you can't just thought
[00:08:42] action diffuse your way to immortality
[00:08:45] now in Clinical Psychology when what we
[00:08:48] do our actions are directly tie to our
[00:08:51] feelings and our thoughts that's called
[00:08:53] thought action fusion and so being able
[00:08:55] to separate that is thought action
[00:08:57] defusion this actually comes up a lot in
[00:08:58] anxiety y therapy the feelings of
[00:09:01] anxiety are a physical sensation our
[00:09:04] hands are getting clammy they're shaking
[00:09:06] a bit we feel that our heart racing
[00:09:08] we're actually feeling these physical
[00:09:11] symptoms of an adrenaline response our
[00:09:13] body entering the fight or flight mode
[00:09:15] and it's actually the exact same
[00:09:16] response as if you were really excited
[00:09:18] about something the physical Sensations
[00:09:20] aren't inherently negative but if you
[00:09:22] have anxiety you notice these symptoms
[00:09:25] and then you tell yourself I am anxious
[00:09:29] and we enter an anxious spiral where
[00:09:32] realizing that we are feeling these
[00:09:34] things and therefore we're anxious makes
[00:09:36] us feel even more anxious so step one of
[00:09:39] defuse is to distinguish between a
[00:09:42] feeling and a thought to recognize that
[00:09:45] we can feel something but we can control
[00:09:49] the way we respond and react to that
[00:09:52] feeling and I actually used this method
[00:09:54] before my Ted X talk a couple of years
[00:09:56] ago where I was feeling really nervous
[00:09:58] before I and I I felt those physical
[00:10:01] Sensations and instead of letting myself
[00:10:03] think I feel this and therefore I'm
[00:10:05] anxious I reframed it to be hey I'm
[00:10:08] getting this adrenaline response I'm
[00:10:11] excited I'm about to crush this thing
[00:10:13] and by reframing that physical feeling
[00:10:16] and changing the thought I had from it
[00:10:19] and actually helped me to be a lot more
[00:10:21] confident and that tedex talk ended up
[00:10:23] becoming one of the uh top 1% most
[00:10:26] viewed tedex talks of 2022 by the way
[00:10:29] way I've summarized the main points from
[00:10:31] that tedex talk into my free Weekly
[00:10:34] Newsletter as well where I try to impart
[00:10:37] the advice that will improve your
[00:10:39] learning efficiency every week through
[00:10:42] your inbox it's completely free and if
[00:10:44] you're interested in joining I'll leave
[00:10:45] a link in the description for you so
[00:10:47] next time you feel tired or lazy
[00:10:50] recognize that it's just a feeling you
[00:10:52] feel tired cool feeling lazy that's fine
[00:10:56] but we distinguish between that feeling
[00:10:59] and then what comes after that which is
[00:11:01] the thought which we can control and
[00:11:03] controlling those thoughts is step two
[00:11:06] of Defuse The if which stands for fake
[00:11:10] you've heard of fake it till you make it
[00:11:12] well it's kind of the same for this as
[00:11:14] well think about this when you watch a
[00:11:16] movie and you see an actor or an actress
[00:11:19] you know that they're not actually that
[00:11:21] character you know that they are acting
[00:11:23] and if an actor arrives on set feeling
[00:11:26] tired or lazy guess what they can still
[00:11:29] act like their character who is not
[00:11:33] tired or lazy so instead of I feel lazy
[00:11:37] and tired therefore I must rest and then
[00:11:42] not do anything we can use fake to say I
[00:11:46] feel lazy and tired that's fine I'm just
[00:11:50] going to pretend like someone who's not
[00:11:54] lazy and tired which means this feeling
[00:11:57] doesn't lead to the thought of I must
[00:11:59] rest we don't have to change how we feel
[00:12:03] we can keep feeling lazy or tired but by
[00:12:06] pretending and Faking It pretending and
[00:12:09] doing the actions of someone who doesn't
[00:12:12] feel that way we are able to keep doing
[00:12:14] the actions that we need to do my old
[00:12:17] powerlifting coach put at the best when
[00:12:19] one day I asked him hey I'm feeling
[00:12:21] really tired today I don't think I be
[00:12:23] have to train very well how do you stop
[00:12:26] feeling tired and he replied back just
[00:12:29] train tired what a man and the
[00:12:32] ridiculously powerful part of this
[00:12:35] relationship between feelings and
[00:12:37] thoughts and actions is that it goes
[00:12:40] both ways when we do the actions of
[00:12:43] someone who isn't lazy or tired even if
[00:12:45] it's just pretending and faking it then
[00:12:48] our mind observes the fact that we're
[00:12:51] taking these actions and starts thinking
[00:12:54] hey maybe I'm not so lazy maybe I'm kind
[00:12:56] of productive and that actually makes
[00:12:59] must feel less lazy and tired in the
[00:13:02] first place and in doing that we have
[00:13:03] actually made ourselves more motivated
[00:13:07] so feelings and thoughts don't just lead
[00:13:09] to actions actions can also trigger us
[00:13:12] to have certain thoughts which change
[00:13:15] the way that we feel so by doing step
[00:13:17] one and step two of defuse and unlocking
[00:13:21] thought action defusion we're able to
[00:13:24] act without feeling the need to act
[00:13:28] we're no longer a slave to motivation
[00:13:30] and that is a huge win but once we get
[00:13:33] to this point we'll realize that we can
[00:13:35] only maintain this defused state for a
[00:13:38] short period of time and so now we want
[00:13:41] to maintain this defusion for a longer
[00:13:45] time period if we don't maintain it we
[00:13:47] just end up being dependent on our
[00:13:49] feelings again which brings us all the
[00:13:50] way back to motivation dependent and
[00:13:52] that's why we have step three of Defuse
[00:13:55] The U which stands for uptime we want to
[00:13:58] gradually increase the amount of time
[00:14:01] we're able to activate that thought
[00:14:03] action defusion State and do those
[00:14:05] actions even if we don't feel like it at
[00:14:08] first we might only be able to get
[00:14:09] through 10 minutes of studying great
[00:14:12] that's fine tomorrow we try 12 minutes
[00:14:14] and then 14 and then 20 and then 30
[00:14:17] gradually increase the uptime that we
[00:14:19] can maintain thought action defusion for
[00:14:22] and as we continue to expose our brain
[00:14:24] to this pattern of thinking and acting
[00:14:28] thanks to this cognitive phenomenon
[00:14:30] called
[00:14:31] neuroplasticity our brain will mold and
[00:14:34] adapt and eventually just get better and
[00:14:36] better at activating thought action
[00:14:38] defusion now some people when I teach
[00:14:41] this to them they say that it seems like
[00:14:43] we're kind of training ourselves to
[00:14:46] become mindless robots it doesn't really
[00:14:48] feel natural or right but it's important
[00:14:52] to remember that a lot of our modernday
[00:14:55] challenges and goals and pressures are
[00:14:57] not natural to begin with back when we
[00:15:01] were living in caves and foraging for
[00:15:03] food we didn't come back to our campfire
[00:15:07] every night to sit an exam on the herbs
[00:15:09] that we forag and Cave person Society
[00:15:11] probably didn't care which cave
[00:15:13] University you went to most of our
[00:15:15] modernday goals and pressures are modern
[00:15:19] day creations and to meet these
[00:15:21] artificial demands while staying healthy
[00:15:24] we need to use these deliberate
[00:15:26] Frameworks and techniques to help
[00:15:29] overcome them using strategies like
[00:15:31] defuse is what gives us the freedom to
[00:15:35] live our lives in alignment to how we
[00:15:38] want to live and spend our time having
[00:15:40] said that just because we are constantly
[00:15:44] exposed to and surrounded by these
[00:15:45] artificial distractions doesn't mean we
[00:15:48] just have to sit there and struggle
[00:15:49] through them after all if there were
[00:15:51] just literally fewer barriers in place
[00:15:54] then it will be easier to achieve our
[00:15:56] goal which is why step four the Z in
[00:16:00] defuse is so important which stands for
[00:16:03] Zone to maintain consistency and reduce
[00:16:06] our need for motivation we have to
[00:16:08] create a zone of focus free from
[00:16:11] distraction and procrastination triggers
[00:16:14] a great technique I teach in my program
[00:16:15] for this is the distraction cheat sheet
[00:16:18] do some work or study and anytime you
[00:16:20] get distracted write down on a piece of
[00:16:22] paper what it was you got distracted by
[00:16:24] try to be specific it could be the icon
[00:16:27] of an app that you saw on your desktop
[00:16:29] top or on your phone maybe it was a
[00:16:31] notification that you got or you saw a
[00:16:33] game controller sitting on the table
[00:16:35] then when you're feeling a little less
[00:16:36] lazy remove those distractions and
[00:16:39] triggers from your environment hack your
[00:16:41] game controller away remove apps from
[00:16:44] your home screen or deactivate accounts
[00:16:46] use app blockers like focused work and
[00:16:49] create a focused workspace with all of
[00:16:52] your study or work materials laid out
[00:16:54] there just ready for you to sit down and
[00:16:56] start over time your Zone of focus
[00:17:00] becomes an area that distractions cannot
[00:17:02] touch and by this point you've completed
[00:17:04] all four steps of diffuse you are
[00:17:07] motivation enhanced you are free from
[00:17:09] the shackles of motivation dependence
[00:17:11] you are never going to look for another
[00:17:13] motivational video ever again now it's
[00:17:14] not a magic pill it does take time to
[00:17:17] practice this and get bitter at it but
[00:17:19] it is a proven strategy that pretty much
[00:17:21] anyone can do now if you found this
[00:17:23] video helpful you'll also find my weekly
[00:17:25] learning drops newsletter helpful I talk
[00:17:27] about how to do Active Learning properly

=== The ONLY Way to Beat Procrastination ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbeyFz4bdHg

[00:00:00] when we give it this name
[00:00:01] procrastination it makes it seem like
[00:00:02] this big phenomenon in itself and it
[00:00:05] hides the true nature of what it is when
[00:00:07] we are procrastinating something what is
[00:00:08] it actually saying we're basically
[00:00:10] saying I do not want to do this right
[00:00:13] usually something that we should do but
[00:00:15] we don't want to do it so when someone
[00:00:17] says how do I stop procrastinating it
[00:00:19] makes it seem like there's this kind of
[00:00:21] like magic spell that you need to break
[00:00:23] but actually what you're asking is how
[00:00:25] do I do something that I hate doing and
[00:00:27] that is a very different question
[00:00:29] because instead instead of asking that
[00:00:30] we could be asking something else like
[00:00:32] how do I make it more enjoyable and that
[00:00:35] is actually a perfectly valid question
[00:00:36] even for something like studying most
[00:00:38] people are just conditioned to study in
[00:00:40] such a meaningless Bland way that it's
[00:00:42] really boring but the human brain loves
[00:00:44] learning if you're studying in a way
[00:00:45] that's truly activating effective
[00:00:47] learning it's actually more enjoyable
[00:00:49] and engaging without you having to force
[00:00:51] it to become more enjoyable or engaging
[00:00:53] so the question we should be asking is
[00:00:54] how do we make studying more enjoyable


=== How to actually study Math ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZzevkW-Gy8

[00:00:00] the first thing is that math has a lot
[00:00:01] of procedural and conditional components
[00:00:03] to it a big part of math will be
[00:00:05] dependent on being able to do good inter
[00:00:07] Le retrieval however math is typically
[00:00:09] taught with only a procedur and
[00:00:11] conditional Focus the declarative
[00:00:13] aspects of math are often either not
[00:00:14] taught at all or like very very very
[00:00:16] understated but if you like literally
[00:00:17] just like go on YouTube and like listen
[00:00:19] to these math prodigies and established
[00:00:21] professors of mathematics talk about the
[00:00:23] best way to learn math they all say that
[00:00:25] before you learn how to use the equation
[00:00:27] formulas you should understand in words
[00:00:30] what it is that you're learning and why
[00:00:31] you're learning it the difficulty is
[00:00:33] that when you first receive the
[00:00:34] information when it's taught to you it's
[00:00:36] taught to you in a way that is far
[00:00:37] remove from that level of conceptual
[00:00:40] understanding and that's where the
[00:00:40] effort comes in a big part of being able
[00:00:43] to solve complex problems like a lot of
[00:00:45] stuff in calculus is understanding
[00:00:48] conceptually how to approach the problem
[00:00:51] before you even think about the numbers
[00:00:52] and the formulas as part of it


=== The Ultimate Guide to The Perfect Mindmap (6-Step Checklist) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grd7K7bJVWg

[00:00:00] I've taught people to mind map for over
[00:00:01] 10 years I've made hundreds of mind maps
[00:00:04] myself and reviewed thousands more as a
[00:00:06] coach it's a skill that's allowed me and
[00:00:08] my students to not only get top results
[00:00:10] but to do so efficiently and without
[00:00:12] spending every waking hour studying so
[00:00:14] in this video I'll show you my six-step
[00:00:17] framework for mind mapping which I call
[00:00:19] grind and each step of this framework
[00:00:22] helps you unlock a different learning
[00:00:25] outcome following these six steps
[00:00:27] correctly will help you create the
[00:00:29] perfect mind map which allows you to
[00:00:31] have a deep and nuanced understanding of
[00:00:34] a topic much more quickly than what it
[00:00:37] would normally take you as well as a
[00:00:40] stronger memory on what you've learned
[00:00:42] and the ability to apply what you've
[00:00:44] learned in deeper more nuanced ways but
[00:00:46] first we need to clear up a common
[00:00:48] misunderstanding and talk about what a
[00:00:50] perfect mind map even is and once we
[00:00:53] understand what a perfect mind map
[00:00:54] actually means creating one becomes much
[00:00:57] easier you see the perfect mind map is
[00:01:00] less about the Mind map and more about
[00:01:02] the process you use to create it let's
[00:01:05] say you took one of the mind maps that I
[00:01:06] created and got first in class and then
[00:01:09] you imported that into your own notes
[00:01:11] would you do just as well with just that
[00:01:14] probably not and that's because you
[00:01:16] can't just copy paste Knowledge from one
[00:01:18] person's brain into another well at
[00:01:21] least not yet learning is not something
[00:01:23] that happens automatically or even
[00:01:25] naturally in some cases learning is a
[00:01:27] series of processes that we have to
[00:01:30] deliberately engage in great Learners
[00:01:32] are ones that have a lot of great
[00:01:35] processes and bad Learners are ones that
[00:01:38] are either not engaging in enough
[00:01:40] processes or they're wasting time with
[00:01:43] the wrong processes and when we engage
[00:01:45] in the right effective processes the
[00:01:49] side effects of that are better
[00:01:51] understanding better memory and a better
[00:01:53] ability to apply what we've learned when
[00:01:55] we use the wrong processes that's when
[00:01:58] we can spend hours and hours reading and
[00:02:01] writing notes and not really having any
[00:02:03] benefit on our memory or our
[00:02:05] understanding or our ability use
[00:02:06] knowledge so what most people don't
[00:02:08] appreciate is that the point of
[00:02:09] mindmapping isn't to have a mindmap the
[00:02:12] Mind map itself is not the knowledge
[00:02:14] mindmapping is a skill that helps us
[00:02:17] engage in the right thinking processes
[00:02:21] to build the knowledge and that concept
[00:02:23] is distilled in my six-step grind
[00:02:26] checklist when we create a mind map
[00:02:28] following grind we effectively Force our
[00:02:31] brain to engage in high efficiency in
[00:02:34] coding which is basically the technical
[00:02:36] term for our brain turning information
[00:02:39] into memory so let's start with the
[00:02:41] first step of grind which is also one of
[00:02:43] the most fundamental processes that you
[00:02:45] should ever do in learning there's
[00:02:47] almost no situation where you should not
[00:02:50] be doing this and step one of grind the
[00:02:53] G is
[00:02:56] grouping grouping is simply arranging
[00:02:59] related ideas together so for example if
[00:03:02] I have these pens then grouping just
[00:03:05] means that I'm categorizing them somehow
[00:03:08] and putting the categories together the
[00:03:10] hard part which takes thinking and
[00:03:12] therefore promotes learning is figuring
[00:03:15] out what kind of grouping I want for
[00:03:19] example I could group these pens based
[00:03:21] on color or I could group them based on
[00:03:25] how much ink is left in them or I could
[00:03:28] even group them based on sentimental
[00:03:30] value uh this one I got as a as a gift
[00:03:33] and this one I just found off the floor
[00:03:35] so you see the way that we think about
[00:03:38] how these items are similar or related
[00:03:40] to each other affects the groups we
[00:03:42] arrive at the point is that there are
[00:03:44] always multiple ways that we can group
[00:03:48] information and the right way for you
[00:03:51] and your memory is not always the first
[00:03:54] almost obvious one even if that's the
[00:03:56] way that it's taught to you so if we
[00:03:58] have a look here are some mind m that do
[00:04:00] not have much grouping going on and now
[00:04:05] we have a look at some mind maps that do
[00:04:07] have grouping when we create groups to
[00:04:10] organize information it has a twofold
[00:04:13] benefit the first one is that the
[00:04:15] process of grouping and figuring out how
[00:04:17] I want to arrange information promotes a
[00:04:20] stronger memory and depth of
[00:04:22] understanding but in addition the fact
[00:04:24] that we have organized the information
[00:04:26] in these categories makes it easier for
[00:04:29] our brain to then retain and access that
[00:04:32] information again in the future in other
[00:04:33] words we not only benefit from having
[00:04:36] these groups in our memory but the
[00:04:38] process of making the groups themselves
[00:04:42] is also beneficial in the learning
[00:04:44] science research will often hear the
[00:04:46] benefits of grouping refer to by terms
[00:04:48] like chunking or scaffolding or creating
[00:04:50] mental models or information schemas and
[00:04:53] as more and more research comes out
[00:04:55] we're increasingly finding that grouping
[00:04:58] is critical for promoting a strong
[00:05:01] memory now these days with AI there are
[00:05:04] actually some ways that we can kind of
[00:05:05] cheat the step and get the AI to group
[00:05:08] things for you and there are definitely
[00:05:10] some ways that you can use AI to help
[00:05:13] you but there are some ways that it can
[00:05:15] harm you instead I'll show you the right
[00:05:17] way to use AI later uh right after I go
[00:05:20] through the other steps of grind now
[00:05:22] step two of grind is something that we
[00:05:24] already started doing back in step one
[00:05:26] while we're grouping but here we take it
[00:05:28] to the next level the r in grind step
[00:05:32] two stands for relational we want to
[00:05:36] make our mind maps relational relational
[00:05:39] means we're thinking about how ideas are
[00:05:43] related to each other and we're
[00:05:45] expressing that on our mind map and
[00:05:47] there are broadly three levels of
[00:05:50] relationships that we can form while
[00:05:51] mind mapping in level one we have too
[00:05:55] few relationships and here's an example
[00:05:59] of that now at level two we are having
[00:06:03] too many relationships it's getting
[00:06:06] overwhelming and that's what it looks
[00:06:08] like here and then in level three we
[00:06:11] have a good amount of very organized
[00:06:15] relationships and it's the fact that you
[00:06:18] can actually have too many relationships
[00:06:22] that makes this second step tricky
[00:06:25] here's why a relationship can be any way
[00:06:30] that two facts or concepts relate to
[00:06:33] each other this could be a influence
[00:06:36] that they have on each other it could be
[00:06:37] a cause and effect relationship it could
[00:06:40] be a chronological relationship like
[00:06:43] step one or step two or any other
[00:06:46] conceptual link which means there are
[00:06:48] really a lot of different ways that two
[00:06:51] things or three things or an entire
[00:06:53] topic can be related to each other so
[00:06:56] it's not enough just to know
[00:07:00] that two things are related we have to
[00:07:03] understand the nature of that
[00:07:06] relationship when we put down just every
[00:07:08] relationship we can find that's when it
[00:07:11] ends up looking like that level two
[00:07:14] where there's too much going on we have
[00:07:16] to consciously decide which
[00:07:19] relationships are important enough for
[00:07:22] us to put down on the Mind map and
[00:07:24] that's a decision that we need to make
[00:07:26] now the reason that the grind checklist
[00:07:28] is so effective is because because each
[00:07:30] step of grind influences the other step
[00:07:34] so for example depending on the types of
[00:07:37] relationships we want to emphasize it
[00:07:40] also affects the groups we will form so
[00:07:43] if we take this example of uh a medical
[00:07:45] disease this is the method of grouping
[00:07:48] and the types of relationships that are
[00:07:50] a little bit more obvious this is
[00:07:51] usually how it'll be taught in a
[00:07:52] textbook but here is that exact same
[00:07:55] topic and the same
[00:07:56] information arranged differently by
[00:07:59] looking at different types of
[00:08:01] relationships which leads to different
[00:08:03] types of groups and you can see that the
[00:08:05] two look very different to each other
[00:08:08] and that reflects it being organized in
[00:08:11] a different way in our mind now there's
[00:08:13] no right or wrong answer it's the
[00:08:16] process of trying to figure out which is
[00:08:19] best for me that promotes that stronger
[00:08:22] memory and depth of understanding you'll
[00:08:24] also see later on how the other steps
[00:08:26] influence your grouping and
[00:08:27] relationships as well now the third step
[00:08:30] of the grind checklist is something that
[00:08:32] should naturally occur if we did step
[00:08:35] one the grouping and step two the
[00:08:37] relationships properly but if we do
[00:08:40] happen to miss step three then we'll
[00:08:42] find that we know each individual
[00:08:46] concept pretty well but we struggle to
[00:08:49] apply that information especially in
[00:08:52] more complex problem solving having
[00:08:54] deeper discussions we're just trying to
[00:08:56] use that knowledge in a way that's
[00:08:58] different to how it was just directly
[00:09:00] taught to you so if you've ever felt
[00:09:01] that way about what you've learned then
[00:09:03] step three is the one you need to look
[00:09:05] out for and step three the eye and grind
[00:09:08] stands for making our mind maps
[00:09:12] interconnected once we have formed the
[00:09:14] groups and relationships in step one and
[00:09:16] step two we need to make sure that the
[00:09:19] groups themselves are related and
[00:09:22] connected to each other to create an
[00:09:24] overall structure AKA a big picture
[00:09:28] understanding of the topic and here's an
[00:09:29] example of a mind map that has done step
[00:09:32] one and step two correctly so there are
[00:09:34] groups and there are lots of
[00:09:35] relationships but it's not very well
[00:09:38] interconnected you can see that there
[00:09:40] are these really dense uh bodies of
[00:09:44] relationships but the overall connection
[00:09:47] between each group is relatively weak
[00:09:50] and loose when we zoom out it's a little
[00:09:52] hard to see how that entire topic comes
[00:09:54] together this is a pattern I call
[00:09:56] Islands and it's actually one of the
[00:09:58] over 90 patterns in my training program
[00:10:01] that I teach people to avoid this
[00:10:03] usually happens when we get Tunnel
[00:10:04] Vision on what we're learning and we're
[00:10:06] not really thinking about how what we're
[00:10:08] learning right now relates to that
[00:10:11] overall big picture frequently enough
[00:10:13] and when that happens and we end up with
[00:10:15] these islands of quite concentrated but
[00:10:18] sort of isolated uh groups then it
[00:10:22] compartmentalizes our understanding of
[00:10:25] the topic and it restricts our ability
[00:10:27] to use that information more freely and
[00:10:30] fluidly which is exactly the type of way
[00:10:32] we need to be able to think about the
[00:10:34] information to do complex problem
[00:10:37] solving or to have deeper more nuanced
[00:10:40] applications so here's an example where
[00:10:42] there is a similar density of
[00:10:43] information but it's been organized with
[00:10:46] a much better overall structure and aka
[00:10:49] the interconnectedness is a lot better
[00:10:52] and you can see it actually just looks
[00:10:55] cleaner and more organized as well and
[00:10:56] by making sure that our mind maps are
[00:10:59] grouped relational and interconnected
[00:11:03] we're able to form what's known in the
[00:11:04] research as a knowledge schema which is
[00:11:07] basically the way that our brain
[00:11:09] organizes information to form knowledge
[00:11:12] and memory now just for your reference
[00:11:14] getting to this point with your mind
[00:11:16] mapping skill is not something that you
[00:11:17] can usually pull off in just one or two
[00:11:20] attempts at least not correctly most
[00:11:22] people try mind mapping they're not
[00:11:25] really able to hit these first three
[00:11:27] steps correctly they don't find mind
[00:11:30] mapping as very useful for them and then
[00:11:31] they stop and yes if you're not doing it
[00:11:34] correctly it's not going to be effective
[00:11:36] on my training program I normally teach
[00:11:38] these types of processes over 3 to four
[00:11:41] weeks and then an additional 3 or 4
[00:11:43] weeks to refine and consolidate them and
[00:11:45] the reason is because each step of grind
[00:11:49] has several cognitive processes that we
[00:11:52] need to get correct to be able to do it
[00:11:55] properly and those processes are not
[00:11:57] always obvious trying to do all of them
[00:12:00] correctly all at once is pretty much
[00:12:03] impossible but when we spend a week on
[00:12:06] just nailing one part of the process and
[00:12:09] then the next week on the next part of
[00:12:10] the process then it means that every
[00:12:13] week we can consistently improve
[00:12:16] unlocking B and better results along the
[00:12:18] way by the way these processes do get
[00:12:20] quite complicated so if you want me to
[00:12:21] dive into any of them and more detail
[00:12:24] let me know in the comments
[00:12:25] alternatively if you want to learn each
[00:12:27] step of making the perfect my map
[00:12:30] straight away in complete detail with
[00:12:32] stepbystep instructions and feedback on
[00:12:35] your work then you might be interested
[00:12:37] in my program at I can study I'll leave
[00:12:39] a link in the description if you want to
[00:12:40] learn more about it and see if it's
[00:12:42] right for you now by this point if we've
[00:12:44] gone out grouping relational and
[00:12:46] interconnected parts of the Mind map
[00:12:47] done we should be seeing some real
[00:12:50] improvements to our memory and our
[00:12:53] ability to understand Concepts deeply
[00:12:56] comprehensively and accurately uh and
[00:12:58] our ility to apply that information and
[00:13:01] in my experience this is almost certain
[00:13:03] so if you've done the grni steps and
[00:13:07] you're not seeing these improvements it
[00:13:09] probably means that one of those
[00:13:11] processes was not quite done correctly
[00:13:14] however even though it's effective a lot
[00:13:16] of people find that doing this can take
[00:13:19] a lot of time especially during uh
[00:13:21] lectures or seminars where someone is
[00:13:24] talking to you and you need to process
[00:13:25] that information and write notes on the
[00:13:27] go it can seem impossible which is which
[00:13:29] is where step four the N of grind comes
[00:13:32] in which is to make our mind maps
[00:13:36] nonverbal non-verbal simply means that
[00:13:38] we should try to express our ideas
[00:13:41] without necessarily using so many words
[00:13:44] there's a lot of research around how
[00:13:46] writing lots of notes can actually
[00:13:48] reduce the quality of your learning
[00:13:50] because it probably means you're not
[00:13:52] processing the information as much
[00:13:54] before you write it down you might have
[00:13:55] also noticed that in the previous my map
[00:13:57] examples I showed you most of the we're
[00:13:59] not that wordy and this is the first
[00:14:02] level of achieving in nonverbal which is
[00:14:05] just to reduce unnecessary words
[00:14:09] reducing unnecessary words forces you to
[00:14:12] synthesize and summarize what you're
[00:14:14] learning doing this also helps you to
[00:14:16] engage in What's called the generation
[00:14:18] effect of learning which is one of the
[00:14:20] most important processes to build new
[00:14:22] knowledge effectively one excellent way
[00:14:25] of reducing your wordiness is just to
[00:14:27] use your lines arrows and spatial
[00:14:30] arrangement to represent ideas for
[00:14:32] example instead of writing the sentence
[00:14:34] the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy
[00:14:37] dog she sells seashells by the seashore
[00:14:41] we can instead draw something like
[00:14:46] this and the bonus benefit of doing this
[00:14:48] is that it gives us an opportunity to
[00:14:51] look at the information and ask
[00:14:53] ourselves how can I group this what are
[00:14:56] the relationships that I can find those
[00:14:59] step one and step two processes for
[00:15:01] example why is the fox jumping over the
[00:15:05] lazy dog why is the dog lazy why is she
[00:15:08] selling seashells is there a
[00:15:10] relationship between the selling of
[00:15:12] seashells and the lazy dog is she
[00:15:15] raising money to build a fence to
[00:15:18] protect the dog from the fox because a
[00:15:20] dog is not lazy it's actually elderly
[00:15:23] and disabled this kind of thinking and
[00:15:26] uh questioning is one of the most
[00:15:28] important things that we can actually do
[00:15:30] is part of a process that's called
[00:15:32] Active Learning which is crucial for
[00:15:34] promoting a strong memory and a deeper
[00:15:36] level of understanding we can also take
[00:15:38] nonverbal to the next level by adding
[00:15:41] some simple sometimes abstract images
[00:15:44] you can see I did a very basic example
[00:15:47] on this here with the shells some
[00:15:49] symbols here for she and and and the
[00:15:51] money uh but here's another example
[00:15:54] where I spend a little bit more time to
[00:15:55] flesh it out and doing this is something
[00:15:59] that I call adding a memory landmark by
[00:16:02] drawing these memorable somewhat
[00:16:05] abstract images in our mind maps it
[00:16:08] makes it easier for us to review the
[00:16:11] information and come back to it in the
[00:16:12] future it creates a unique element in
[00:16:16] our notes that makes it more memorable
[00:16:18] and it also makes the process a little
[00:16:19] bit more fun does take a bit of time
[00:16:21] though so I probably wouldn't be doing
[00:16:23] that during a lecture or a seminar now
[00:16:25] to get to this point where we've got g r
[00:16:28] i and in down I would expect that this
[00:16:31] takes at least a couple of months of
[00:16:34] practice but remember before you have
[00:16:35] mastered this you're still going to be
[00:16:38] getting benefits from just applying this
[00:16:40] probably straight away and once you have
[00:16:43] mastered it your mind maps are going to
[00:16:45] be so beneficial for your learning that
[00:16:47] people around you are going to look at
[00:16:49] your notes and have no idea how you are
[00:16:52] doing so well and they will certainly
[00:16:54] have no idea about how deep the process
[00:16:57] was that you used to create your notes
[00:16:59] but it is the next two steps of grind
[00:17:04] that take our mind mapping skill to the
[00:17:07] highest level starting with step five
[00:17:09] the D of grind we have to make our mind
[00:17:13] maps
[00:17:15] directional a perfect mind map not only
[00:17:18] has groups has relationships is
[00:17:21] interconnected is non veriable it also
[00:17:24] has directionality or in other words
[00:17:27] flow and no I don't mean a mystical
[00:17:31] chakra flow uh I mean that we're using
[00:17:35] arrows to show how the ideas on our mind
[00:17:38] map interact with each other using mind
[00:17:41] maps purposefully to add Direction and
[00:17:44] flow in our mind map achieves two main
[00:17:47] things first of all it forces us to
[00:17:49] examine the nature of the relationships
[00:17:52] and the groups that we're formed like
[00:17:53] for example if I've got these Concepts
[00:17:56] here sure these might all be be related
[00:17:59] to each other but are they related to
[00:18:02] each other in a way that looks
[00:18:05] like this or maybe it's more accurate to
[00:18:08] say that the relationships are more
[00:18:12] like this they're the same
[00:18:16] relationships but it paints a completely
[00:18:18] different picture and number two it
[00:18:20] actually helps make our mind maps
[00:18:21] clearer and more organized which also
[00:18:24] helps with our retention have a look at
[00:18:26] this mind map that doesn't have great
[00:18:30] directionality and now have a look at
[00:18:33] this one that does you can see that this
[00:18:36] one with more directionality gives the
[00:18:39] mindmap more of a purposeful structure
[00:18:41] it adds meaning and context to the mymap
[00:18:45] which ultimately makes it more memorable
[00:18:47] now finally we're ready for the sixth
[00:18:49] and final step of grind which is
[00:18:51] arguably the step that most people skip
[00:18:54] but is also the step that probably
[00:18:57] increases our knowledge our memory our
[00:19:00] depth of understanding to the highest
[00:19:02] level a grind map without the final
[00:19:05] sixth step the E is not a perfect mind
[00:19:09] map and the E step six stands for making
[00:19:12] our mind maps
[00:19:14] emphasized emphasizing your mind maps is
[00:19:17] all about making decisions and judgments
[00:19:21] about what you learning AKA that
[00:19:24] critical level five of Bloom's taxonomy
[00:19:27] that higher order thinking to achieve
[00:19:30] step six and make our mind maps
[00:19:31] emphasized we need to deliberately make
[00:19:35] a decision on which relationships and
[00:19:38] groups and combination of relationships
[00:19:41] and groups are the most important for
[00:19:45] this topic and we need to visually
[00:19:48] represent that on our mindmap this
[00:19:50] creates something that I often call the
[00:19:52] backbone of the Mind map here is an
[00:19:54] example without clear emphasizing
[00:19:59] and now here are a couple that have good
[00:20:04] emphasizing now those of you that are on
[00:20:06] my program have probably heard me or the
[00:20:08] other coaches uh talking about the
[00:20:10] backbone constantly and there is good
[00:20:13] reason for that it's because a mind map
[00:20:16] with a clear backbone means that the
[00:20:19] most important relationships and groups
[00:20:21] have been clearly emphasized which means
[00:20:24] we have made clear and deliberate
[00:20:27] judgments about which parts of the Mind
[00:20:29] map and the topic are most important now
[00:20:32] remember how I said that each step of
[00:20:34] the grind map actually influences each
[00:20:37] other well here's another example of
[00:20:39] that when we examine which relationships
[00:20:42] and groups are the most important often
[00:20:45] we find that the relationships and
[00:20:47] groups we expressed are not actually the
[00:20:50] best maybe there's an alternative
[00:20:53] grouping or relationship structure that
[00:20:55] we think would actually make even more
[00:20:57] sense and if that happens
[00:20:59] that's a disaster because now we have to
[00:21:01] go through and do step one two and three
[00:21:04] all over again and that takes time is
[00:21:08] what you might think but
[00:21:11] actually this is a good thing by forcing
[00:21:14] ourselves to think about what we're
[00:21:16] learning more critically and make more
[00:21:19] explicit judgments about the importance
[00:21:22] of different things it helps us to
[00:21:24] refine and consolidate our knowledge
[00:21:27] helping us arise at a knowledge that is
[00:21:30] more accurate and deeper and is also
[00:21:33] stickier in our memory this back and
[00:21:36] forth process where we're redoing parts
[00:21:39] of the Mind map and adjusting the
[00:21:41] structure and regrouping and testing
[00:21:43] different relationships and going back
[00:21:45] and forth between different resources
[00:21:47] this is actually a natural part of
[00:21:50] learning which in the research is often
[00:21:52] called the recursive nature of deep
[00:21:54] learning and you can't skip the step or
[00:21:57] at least you shouldn't if you want a
[00:21:59] high level of knowledge Mastery the
[00:22:01] ability to explain what is and is not
[00:22:04] important and justify that is a Hallmark
[00:22:07] sign of expertise likewise not being
[00:22:11] able to clearly articulate what is or is
[00:22:14] not important but instead just knowing a
[00:22:16] whole bunch of individual facts that are
[00:22:19] generally connected to each other is a
[00:22:22] sign of a beginner in that topic now
[00:22:24] earlier in the video I said that there
[00:22:26] is a right and wrong way of using AI to
[00:22:30] help you make a mind map and if we
[00:22:32] remember that mind mapping is a process
[00:22:36] a skill that helps us engage in the
[00:22:39] right thinking process to promote good
[00:22:42] learning it becomes much more obvious as
[00:22:44] to what will help us and what will harm
[00:22:46] us for example I could plug a bunch of
[00:22:48] keywords into chat GPT and get it to
[00:22:51] generate some groups for
[00:22:57] me and just like like that it's done
[00:23:00] would that be harmful or helpful for our
[00:23:03] learning well if we remember the fact
[00:23:06] that the process of looking for
[00:23:09] similarities and differences and
[00:23:11] therefore deciding on which groups we
[00:23:14] want to form in itself is a process that
[00:23:17] helps us with learning then getting AI
[00:23:20] to just do that for us would be harmful
[00:23:24] it saves us time but it defeats the
[00:23:27] purpose of grouping it in the first
[00:23:28] place okay but what about instead if I
[00:23:30] think of some groups myself but then I
[00:23:33] use chat GPT to verify whether those
[00:23:37] groups make sense or not after all those
[00:23:40] are the types of things that it could be
[00:23:42] hard to verify using a Google search or
[00:23:44] trolling through your textbook
[00:24:01] now that bit of feedback actually seems
[00:24:04] pretty helpful so was this going to be
[00:24:07] helpful or harmful for our learning well
[00:24:10] in this case it would be helpful because
[00:24:12] we've already done the hard part of
[00:24:14] thinking about the groups and comparing
[00:24:16] and arriving at some kind of hypothesis
[00:24:19] and verifying whether that hypothesis is
[00:24:22] legitimate or not through Google
[00:24:24] searches and reading through pages and
[00:24:27] pages of textbooks and lecture slides is
[00:24:29] not really that different from getting
[00:24:31] the answer in a single report so as a
[00:24:33] rule of thumb using AI in our learning
[00:24:36] is generally harmful for learning if it
[00:24:40] number one makes it cognitively easier
[00:24:44] for us to organize the information and
[00:24:46] number two if it bypasses the need for
[00:24:50] us to compare or make active independent
[00:24:55] judgments about what we're learning on
[00:24:57] the other hand AI is generally helpful
[00:24:59] if it saves Time For Us in just
[00:25:03] collecting information or in just
[00:25:07] summarizing large bodies for us to then
[00:25:10] process and compare and make judgments
[00:25:12] on or number three it saves time
[00:25:15] compared to doing a Google search of
[00:25:17] essentially the same thing now if you
[00:25:19] follow these guidelines you will be well
[00:25:21] on your way to creating the perfect mind
[00:25:24] map but as I mentioned before there's a
[00:25:25] lot more to mindmapping than just this
[00:25:28] and there are dozens of these cognitive
[00:25:30] processes that you need to pull off
[00:25:32] correctly to get to the perfect my map
[00:25:35] stage if there's a particular aspect of
[00:25:37] grind that you'd like me to go deeper
[00:25:39] into those processes for then please let
[00:25:41] me know in the comments and I'll think
[00:25:43] about that for some of my future videos
[00:25:45] or bit yet if you want to get started
[00:25:46] straight away at becoming a hyper
[00:25:48] efficient learner then you might want to

=== 5 Dimensions of Learning Every Student MUST Master ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0yzQDBKNY

[00:00:00] there's a strategy for getting better at
[00:00:02] learning that I've been using for the
[00:00:04] thousands of people that I've coached
[00:00:06] for the last 10 years it's a strategy
[00:00:09] that not only helped me go from studying
[00:00:11] 20 hours a day to 2 hours a day while
[00:00:14] maintaining top marks but also create
[00:00:16] that kind of change in other people as
[00:00:18] well I call it the Broken Barrel
[00:00:21] approach and although everyone is
[00:00:22] different I found that when used
[00:00:25] correctly this approach is effective for
[00:00:27] virtually every person I've ever coached
[00:00:29] I'm going to show you exactly how you
[00:00:30] can use the Broken Barrel approach as
[00:00:33] well as explain the five Dimensions that
[00:00:35] you have to understand to use the
[00:00:36] approach in the first place but before
[00:00:38] we get into that we need to understand
[00:00:40] the more common ways that people try to
[00:00:42] get better at learning and why that
[00:00:44] absolutely does not work there are
[00:00:46] generally three ways people try to
[00:00:48] become a better learner the first one
[00:00:50] which is the most common is the Silver
[00:00:52] Bullet approach now if you have ever
[00:00:54] asked what is the best studying
[00:00:57] technique then you're probably using the
[00:00:59] Silver Bullet approach
[00:01:00] and this approach is pretty much doomed
[00:01:03] to be a waste of time from the very
[00:01:05] beginning so 80 years ago there was this
[00:01:07] French writer called HRI purah who wrote
[00:01:10] this novel about werewolves and this
[00:01:13] werewolf was causing havoc in the town
[00:01:16] but no one could stop this werewolf and
[00:01:18] then at the end of the book this Hunter
[00:01:20] comes up and shoots the werewolf with a
[00:01:23] bullet cast out of silver and everyone
[00:01:27] is sa and thus the term Silver Bullet
[00:01:29] was was born so why is it that asking
[00:01:32] what is the best studying technique the
[00:01:34] Silver Bullet approach because it
[00:01:36] assumes that there is a single almost
[00:01:39] magical solution that solves all of your
[00:01:42] learning and studying related problems
[00:01:44] if this was true then learning to learn
[00:01:46] would be very easy becoming a genius
[00:01:48] would be a walk in the park uh but
[00:01:50] unfortunately there is no such thing as
[00:01:52] the best technique there is no Universal
[00:01:55] trick or hack that works for everyone in
[00:01:58] every circumstance uh for every
[00:02:00] challenge for example flash cards are a
[00:02:01] great technique for memorizing and
[00:02:03] recalling isolated facts but they're
[00:02:06] pretty useless for complex problem
[00:02:08] solving this is why it's not a very
[00:02:09] popular method for post-graduate study
[00:02:12] or professional work likewise you can
[00:02:13] have 10 different people using the exact
[00:02:16] same studying technique and have very
[00:02:19] different outcomes and as long as you're
[00:02:21] looking for a silver bullet solution
[00:02:25] you're never really going to get any
[00:02:27] better at studying cuz you're looking
[00:02:28] for something that actually doesn't
[00:02:29] exist
[00:02:30] once we accept the fact that there's no
[00:02:33] such thing as a best studying Technique
[00:02:35] we can ask the real questions that make
[00:02:37] a difference like what are the parts of
[00:02:40] the way that I learn that are helping me
[00:02:43] which parts are holding me back and
[00:02:45] importantly what are my learning
[00:02:48] strengths and weaknesses everyone has
[00:02:51] different strengths and weaknesses and
[00:02:53] is the combination of these strengths
[00:02:56] and weaknesses that determine the
[00:02:58] results that you get which brings us to
[00:03:00] the second less common but smarter
[00:03:04] approach to improving studying which is
[00:03:07] the strength's first approach and as the
[00:03:10] name suggests this is when we focus on
[00:03:12] our learning strengths and we enhance
[00:03:15] them to get better at studying unlike
[00:03:17] the Silver Bullet approach figuring out
[00:03:19] our learning strengths and then making
[00:03:21] them stronger is a lot more personalized
[00:03:24] and when it comes to learning
[00:03:26] personalized means effective so what
[00:03:28] even is a learning strength well a
[00:03:31] strength is something that you find
[00:03:33] naturally easier to be good at they're a
[00:03:36] manifestation of our natural talents and
[00:03:39] tendencies which means that when we put
[00:03:41] effort into improving them they can
[00:03:44] become our Ultimate Weapon at least
[00:03:47] that's the idea but when it comes to
[00:03:49] learning and studying that doesn't
[00:03:52] actually work and the reason is because
[00:03:56] for learning you are only as good as
[00:04:00] your weakest link so imagine this wooden
[00:04:03] barrel is our ability to learn now if
[00:04:06] one of these pieces is broken it doesn't
[00:04:09] matter how high the other pieces are
[00:04:11] when we try to fill the barrel with
[00:04:13] water the highest level it's going to
[00:04:15] reach is the level of the broken plank
[00:04:19] now when it comes to learning there are
[00:04:21] five planks that make up your learning
[00:04:25] ability Barrel I call these the five
[00:04:28] dimensions of learning and and these are
[00:04:31] deep
[00:04:33] processing
[00:04:35] self-regulation
[00:04:37] mindset
[00:04:39] retrieval and
[00:04:44] self-management I'll explain those
[00:04:46] dimensions a little bit more later but
[00:04:47] let's say for example I have great
[00:04:49] processing skills which means I'm able
[00:04:51] to understand Concepts deeply connect
[00:04:54] information together for complex problem
[00:04:56] solving but I have terrible retrieval
[00:05:00] skills which means that I'm never really
[00:05:02] revising what I learn therefore I'm
[00:05:05] forgetting things needlessly and
[00:05:08] therefore I'm going to be missing out on
[00:05:10] marks it doesn't matter if my processing
[00:05:12] ability is Sky High if my retrieval is
[00:05:16] the broken part of the barrel then I'm
[00:05:19] always going to be limited by that or if
[00:05:21] I have great learning skills but then I
[00:05:24] procrastinate like crazy well then again
[00:05:27] I'm going to be limited by that which
[00:05:29] means that for learning our results
[00:05:32] reflect our weaknesses more than they
[00:05:36] reflect our strengths which is why
[00:05:38] instead of focusing on the strengths
[00:05:41] first approach I'm going to teach you
[00:05:42] the Broken Barrel approach the Broken
[00:05:45] Barrel approach starts with addressing
[00:05:47] the weakest links first the parts of our
[00:05:50] Barrel that are the most broken and the
[00:05:53] Broken Barrel approach is a GameChanger
[00:05:55] because it ensures that your method of
[00:05:58] learning is person personalized to what
[00:06:00] is actually holding you back from being
[00:06:03] better and remember when it comes to
[00:06:05] learning personalized means more
[00:06:08] effective so the Broken Barrel strategy
[00:06:11] in itself is pretty straightforward
[00:06:13] figure out your weaknesses and then
[00:06:15] improve them until they're not your
[00:06:16] weakness anymore re-evaluate see where
[00:06:19] your next weakness is and rinse and
[00:06:22] repeat I recommend re-evaluating to see
[00:06:24] if your weaknesses have changed every 3
[00:06:26] or 4 months the hard part is figuring
[00:06:29] fing out your strengths and weaknesses
[00:06:32] in the first place and for learning
[00:06:34] figuring this out is not easy in fact
[00:06:38] it's so not easy that there's even
[00:06:40] research around something called the
[00:06:41] black box of learning which basically
[00:06:44] says that people know that in order for
[00:06:46] them to get good results they need to
[00:06:49] put in time and
[00:06:52] effort but in terms of how that time and
[00:06:55] effort becomes a result is inside what's
[00:06:59] called the black box it's basically a
[00:07:02] mystery and inside this black box are
[00:07:04] the processes of learning and until we
[00:07:08] are able to open up this black box and
[00:07:11] see what's inside it we're never going
[00:07:13] to be able to effectively translate our
[00:07:16] time and effort into better results this
[00:07:18] is the reason why I said that the Silver
[00:07:20] Bullet approach was doomed to waste time
[00:07:24] from the very beginning most people have
[00:07:27] no idea which dimension they're weaker
[00:07:30] in fact most people are not even
[00:07:31] thinking about which weaknesses they
[00:07:33] have in the first place and research has
[00:07:36] repeatedly shown that people are pretty
[00:07:38] bad at identifying their true learning
[00:07:41] weaknesses which means you could spend
[00:07:43] an entire week trying out a new learning
[00:07:46] technique to see absolutely no
[00:07:48] improvement because it's not targeting
[00:07:51] the right part of your Barrel AKA you're
[00:07:54] not targeting your weaknesses in fact
[00:07:56] when you do this it actually makes it
[00:07:58] even harder to improve than doing
[00:08:00] nothing at all because now you've just
[00:08:03] given yourself more things to think
[00:08:05] about which is taking time and effort
[00:08:07] and energy away from the things that
[00:08:09] could be directly helping you to improve
[00:08:12] as if you didn't have enough to worry
[00:08:14] about already so how do we actually
[00:08:16] figure out our learning strengths and
[00:08:18] weaknesses when I coach people on a
[00:08:20] one-on-one basis I'm able to open up the
[00:08:22] black box for them I guide them to
[00:08:24] figure out where their strengths and
[00:08:25] weaknesses are and as a result I've been
[00:08:27] able to help people who have strugg
[00:08:29] strle to improve for years make multiple
[00:08:33] breakthroughs in Just 2 or 3 months
[00:08:35] obviously I can't do one-on ones with
[00:08:37] every single one of you but I still want
[00:08:39] to help you out so I've created a free
[00:08:41] quiz that will ask you a series of
[00:08:44] questions that assess and evaluate your
[00:08:46] learning strengths and weaknesses the
[00:08:48] calculation and questions are ones that
[00:08:50] I've not only tested and refined across
[00:08:53] almost 20,000 Learners going through my
[00:08:55] paid program that I can study but I've
[00:08:58] also conducted a study with Mones
[00:09:00] University to assess its validity it's
[00:09:02] free to use it only takes a few minutes
[00:09:04] and at the end you'll get a personalized
[00:09:06] report on your learning strengths and
[00:09:08] weaknesses based on three of the most
[00:09:11] important dimensions for most Learners
[00:09:13] based on the combination of your results
[00:09:15] it will also tell you your learner type
[00:09:17] which helps you figure out which
[00:09:19] dimension you should work on first I'll
[00:09:21] leave a link in the description for you
[00:09:22] to check that out now the reports will
[00:09:24] go into a little bit more detail but
[00:09:25] I'll briefly describe each of the five
[00:09:27] dimensions and when they become
[00:09:29] strengths versus weaknesses each
[00:09:31] Dimension is equally important and
[00:09:33] remember that a limitation in just one
[00:09:35] of those Dimensions can limit your
[00:09:38] overall result now the First Dimension
[00:09:40] is the dimension that defines genius
[00:09:43] when people talk about learning or
[00:09:45] intelligence or or someone who's a
[00:09:47] genius they're usually just talking
[00:09:49] about this Dimension and that is deep
[00:09:52] processing deep processing is your
[00:09:54] ability to understand and extract
[00:09:57] meaningful learning from from
[00:09:59] information deep processing is what
[00:10:01] allows you to form stronger memories
[00:10:04] understand information more deeply form
[00:10:07] connections between ideas and ultimately
[00:10:09] use what you've learned to solve complex
[00:10:12] problems deep processing is probably a
[00:10:14] strength for you if you find it easy to
[00:10:17] do well you don't have to study as much
[00:10:20] as other people to do well and you feel
[00:10:23] like your memory and depth of
[00:10:25] understanding tend to be stronger than
[00:10:27] most other people on the other hand and
[00:10:29] it's probably a weakness if you struggle
[00:10:31] to do well despite studying a lot it
[00:10:35] takes you a long time to understand
[00:10:37] Concepts or you struggle to apply your
[00:10:40] knowledge in ways that are different to
[00:10:42] how it was directly taught to you most
[00:10:45] top Learners have pretty good deep
[00:10:48] processing which is also why you
[00:10:51] shouldn't just copy the study techniques
[00:10:54] that top Learners use because they can
[00:10:57] get away with using pretty mediocre
[00:10:59] techniques and do well anyway because
[00:11:02] they can compensate for it with just
[00:11:04] better deep processing I like to think
[00:11:06] of deep processing is how powerful the
[00:11:09] engine is in your car but remember each
[00:11:11] Dimension is equally important so if de
[00:11:14] processing is the power of your engine
[00:11:16] then what also matters is how well you
[00:11:18] can drive the car and that's the next
[00:11:21] Dimension the second dimension is self
[00:11:23] regulation and I find that this is a
[00:11:25] common weakness in most people that
[00:11:26] haven't been trained on learning skills
[00:11:29] which is most people self-regulation is
[00:11:32] the awareness of how you learn the
[00:11:35] methods you use the way that you think
[00:11:38] and then your ability to then make
[00:11:41] adjustments to those methods and
[00:11:43] processes to achieve your goals this is
[00:11:46] probably a strength if you have a clear
[00:11:49] idea about how you study and which
[00:11:52] methods you use you also know how you
[00:11:54] think while you're using those methods
[00:11:58] you understand which techniques are
[00:12:00] helping you or harming you and you can
[00:12:03] make adjustments to those techniques to
[00:12:06] keep your learning effective even when
[00:12:08] you have different time pressures uh
[00:12:11] different subjects levels of difficulty
[00:12:14] or different levels of energy now I'm
[00:12:16] saying probably these are your strengths
[00:12:18] and weaknesses because these are all
[00:12:20] pretty generalized descriptions I still
[00:12:22] recommend taking the quiz because it's
[00:12:24] going to give you a much more
[00:12:25] personalized look at which of your
[00:12:28] weaknesses is limiting you the most and
[00:12:30] to what magnitude anyway self-regulation
[00:12:33] is probably a weakness for you if you
[00:12:36] don't really know where to start with
[00:12:39] improving the way that you study you
[00:12:42] don't have a clear idea about what
[00:12:44] methods or processes you use and you're
[00:12:47] not sure how You' make a predictable
[00:12:50] change in your results by adjusting your
[00:12:53] techniques or processes self-regulation
[00:12:56] becomes much more important usually in
[00:12:59] the later years uh especially if your
[00:13:02] deep processing isn't as high or your
[00:13:04] deep processing is high but you're
[00:13:06] aiming for a competitive result amongst
[00:13:09] lots of other people that also have
[00:13:11] highd processing now I would argue that
[00:13:14] although every Dimension is equally
[00:13:18] important the next Dimension is
[00:13:21] potentially the most crucial of all I
[00:13:25] say that because it's the most limiting
[00:13:27] weakness and over 70% of Learners I've
[00:13:31] assessed this is a dimension that
[00:13:33] focuses on how we respond to stress
[00:13:36] challenges and making mistake this third
[00:13:39] dimension is called mindset here's the
[00:13:42] thing learning to learn takes trial and
[00:13:45] error it feels uncertain a lot of the
[00:13:48] time most of the time and it requires a
[00:13:51] lot of experimentation which means if
[00:13:53] you are afraid of making mistakes and
[00:13:55] you don't know how to handle
[00:13:57] uncertainty you're not really going to
[00:14:00] improve this is the kind of situation
[00:14:03] where people can spend years trying to
[00:14:05] get better at learning and make almost
[00:14:07] zero progress the mindset Dimension is
[00:14:10] probably a strength for you if you're
[00:14:12] able to jump into new challenges and
[00:14:15] experiment very easily you're also able
[00:14:17] to make mistakes and learn from them
[00:14:20] quickly on the other hand it's probably
[00:14:22] a weakness if you don't like
[00:14:24] experimenting because it feels uncertain
[00:14:28] and you avoid making mistakes because
[00:14:31] you're afraid of making them you might
[00:14:33] feel a significant blow to your
[00:14:36] confidence or self-esteem when you don't
[00:14:38] do well and you might ask a lot of
[00:14:41] clarifying questions before giving
[00:14:44] something new AO these clarifying
[00:14:47] questions are basically an attempt to
[00:14:49] reduce the level of uncertainty and
[00:14:51] avoid making mistakes having said that
[00:14:54] hands down the most impressive
[00:14:57] Transformations I've ever seen are the
[00:14:59] ones who originally started off being
[00:15:02] limited by the mindset Dimension and
[00:15:04] then improved it now the next Dimension
[00:15:06] is what takes a roar diamond and
[00:15:09] polishes it into a sparkling gem you see
[00:15:12] human memory is far from perfect and no
[00:15:14] matter how good your deep processing or
[00:15:16] self-regulation are there's always going
[00:15:18] to be gaps uh there's always going to be
[00:15:19] things that we forget and we can always
[00:15:21] be faster or more fluent with applying
[00:15:24] what we've learned this is the fourth
[00:15:26] dimension retrieval retrieval is how we
[00:15:29] recall and test ourselves on what we've
[00:15:32] previously learned it's probably a
[00:15:34] strength if you have a good space
[00:15:36] retrieval schedule and you challenge
[00:15:38] yourself at multiple levels of
[00:15:41] difficulty it's probably a weakness if
[00:15:44] you don't really review what you've
[00:15:46] leared before at all or the way that you
[00:15:49] challenge yourself isn't reflective of
[00:15:51] the way that you actually need to use
[00:15:53] your knowledge retrieval is actually a
[00:15:55] dimension that many students score
[00:15:59] pretty highly on and that's because
[00:16:01] they've heard lots of great things about
[00:16:02] space retrieval and flash cards uh
[00:16:05] however most of those students also
[00:16:08] aren't seeing great results and that's
[00:16:10] because it's usually not their limiting
[00:16:13] weakness in other words they weren't
[00:16:15] using the Broken Barrel approach and
[00:16:17] finally there is potentially no other
[00:16:20] dimension that is as frustrating to fix
[00:16:24] as the next one if you've ever wasted an
[00:16:27] entire evening scrolling through social
[00:16:29] media or binging your favorite series or
[00:16:32] youve struggled to manage your time or
[00:16:34] stay focused then you have been limited
[00:16:37] by this final Dimension and that is
[00:16:40] self-management self-management is the
[00:16:42] dimension that is focused on the way
[00:16:44] that you manage your time how you
[00:16:46] prioritize your tasks how you manage
[00:16:49] your focus and distractions how you
[00:16:51] avoid procrastination basically ensure
[00:16:54] that you're spending your time in the
[00:16:56] way that you should be and it's probably
[00:16:58] a strength for you if you can manage
[00:16:59] your time and tasks sustainably and
[00:17:02] consistently you prioritize your tasks
[00:17:05] effectively ensuring that you're
[00:17:07] spending your time on what really
[00:17:08] matters you can manage your focus and
[00:17:10] reduce distractions and you can mitigate
[00:17:13] the procrastination tendencies that
[00:17:15] everyone has it's probably a weakness if
[00:17:18] basically you struggle with all of those
[00:17:20] things uh or you can only do those in
[00:17:23] short bursts of intense concentration
[00:17:26] which is not sustainable once we figure
[00:17:29] are where our true strengths and
[00:17:30] weaknesses lie we can usually improve
[00:17:33] our learning ability week after week in
[00:17:36] fact when I'm coaching someone if I
[00:17:38] don't see progress on a weekly basis it
[00:17:41] tells me that we're probably not
[00:17:43] focusing on the right true weakness so
[00:17:45] please do make sure to use that free
[00:17:47] quiz that I made for you guys it goes
[00:17:48] through the first three dimensions which
[00:17:50] are usually the most important for most
[00:17:52] people in fact I I'll actually show you
[00:17:55] how to use it so this is the quiz first
[00:17:56] I'll start off by answering the
[00:17:57] questions I'm not going to answer this
[00:17:58] the way way that I used to study like 10
[00:18:00] years ago when I was an amoeba floating
[00:18:03] through the the learning
[00:18:08] universe so you can see the results that
[00:18:10] I've gotten here it said I'm a sprout
[00:18:13] it's rated My overall score 65% honestly
[00:18:15] feels kind of high compared to uh how it
[00:18:19] felt at the time but I guess I did end
[00:18:21] up doing pretty well in that year so uh
[00:18:24] it goes through tells me exactly uh
[00:18:27] which each dimension means for me how
[00:18:30] much of an impact it has and what I need
[00:18:32] to do about it and I also get a more
[00:18:35] personalized uh comprehensive report
[00:18:37] sent through in my email and I can now
[00:18:39] take that information and start using
[00:18:41] the Broken Barrel approach which I can
[00:18:44] tell you is about a thousand times
[00:18:47] faster than trying to figure out my
[00:18:50] learning strengths and weaknesses like
[00:18:53] years ago which required me to spend
[00:18:57] years and thousands of hours trial and
[00:18:59] error to figure it out again I'll leave
[00:19:01] the link in the description for you to
[00:19:03] check out I hope this approach gives you
[00:19:04] as much success as it has for me and my
[00:19:07] students thank you so much for watching
[00:19:10] and I will see you in the next one


=== How To Learn Complex Skills So Fast It Feels ILLEGAL ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHN7BXpdAPQ

[00:00:00] there are four stages of learning any
[00:00:02] complex skill that you need to know and
[00:00:04] there are four corresponding actions
[00:00:07] that you have to take to be able to
[00:00:09] learn that skill effectively when we do
[00:00:12] the right actions for the right stage
[00:00:14] we're able to progress through that
[00:00:16] stage very quickly this is what fast
[00:00:19] trcks our ability to learn skills
[00:00:21] unfortunately most people are doing
[00:00:23] actions at stage three when they're only
[00:00:25] at stage two and when there's this
[00:00:27] misalignment it creates Wast of time
[00:00:31] frustration stress and ultimately you
[00:00:33] will not be able to master pretty much
[00:00:35] any complex skill this is where the rail
[00:00:39] framework comes in to make sure that we
[00:00:41] are aligned and mastering new skills as
[00:00:44] effectively as possible by using this
[00:00:45] framework my ability to coach students
[00:00:48] on how to study and learn more
[00:00:49] effectively has become about five or six
[00:00:53] times faster than before what used to
[00:00:55] take me 2 years to train now only takes
[00:00:59] me two or 3 months and I've personally
[00:01:02] used this framework to learn pretty much
[00:01:05] every new skill I've picked up over the
[00:01:07] last 10 years from studying to public
[00:01:10] speaking dancing archery photography
[00:01:13] even using nunchucks in fact actually
[00:01:16] let me show you I I don't break anything
[00:01:18] uh as I do this let's give it a
[00:01:22] [Music]
[00:01:23] go literally just hit my light
[00:01:33] nothing destroyed uh and yes FYI that is
[00:01:36] a skill that serves absolutely no
[00:01:38] purpose in my life but the best part is
[00:01:40] that this framework is actually really
[00:01:44] really easy to use by the end of this
[00:01:45] video you'll learn how to use rail to
[00:01:48] learn any new complex skill but first we
[00:01:51] actually have to understand the
[00:01:52] scientific principle behind why some
[00:01:55] skills are even harder to learn than
[00:01:58] other skills in the first place so when
[00:02:00] I was 15 I watched this video on how to
[00:02:02] tie
[00:02:04] shoelaces really
[00:02:06] quickly and I practiced this skill for
[00:02:10] like 5 minutes and I learned how to do
[00:02:12] it but learning to tie a shoelace is
[00:02:15] very different from learning to play an
[00:02:17] instrument or learning to code or most
[00:02:19] other complex skills and one of the
[00:02:22] things that makes a complex skill
[00:02:24] complex is this thing called the latent
[00:02:28] learning period latent learning was
[00:02:30] first described in the 1930s by this
[00:02:32] American psychologist called Edward
[00:02:34] Tolman and it basically talks about when
[00:02:36] there is no immediate reinforcement
[00:02:39] while you are learning the skill for
[00:02:41] example if I'm learning something simple
[00:02:42] like tying my shoelaces then there's no
[00:02:44] real latent learning period I'm getting
[00:02:46] immediate feedback on whether the shoes
[00:02:48] were tied up well or not but as soon as
[00:02:50] we enter into any even moderately
[00:02:53] complex skill the latent learning period
[00:02:55] stretches out much longer for example if
[00:02:57] you're learn to play chess you might
[00:02:58] spend lots of time weeks even just
[00:03:01] learning the rules and how to move which
[00:03:03] piece and figuring out the strategy but
[00:03:06] until you really play a game and get
[00:03:08] some real experience you're not going to
[00:03:10] know where your mistakes are and how to
[00:03:12] actually improve and so there's a long
[00:03:14] time between the learning and then the
[00:03:17] getting feedback on the learning that's
[00:03:19] the latent learning period and for
[00:03:21] skills like learning how to study you
[00:03:23] might not get feedback on how good your
[00:03:26] new study technique is for weeks or
[00:03:28] months until actually get an exam result
[00:03:31] and during that time you might have done
[00:03:34] hundreds of other things that all affect
[00:03:36] the outcome it's pretty much impossible
[00:03:39] to know what was the reason you got the
[00:03:41] result that you did and therefore what
[00:03:43] you need to change to improve and every
[00:03:46] skill especially complex skills take
[00:03:48] trial and error and experimentation to
[00:03:51] improve but we waste a lot of time
[00:03:55] triing things and making errors over and
[00:03:58] over again sort of aimlessly but if we
[00:04:01] can answer just one question it can
[00:04:04] massively increase our ability to learn
[00:04:07] any complex skill and that question is
[00:04:11] am I moving in the right direction
[00:04:14] because even if we don't know the
[00:04:16] fastest most direct line to learn a
[00:04:19] skill if we have guidelines that tell us
[00:04:21] whenever we're potentially deviating off
[00:04:24] track then we know that our experiments
[00:04:26] and our efforts are going to eventually
[00:04:28] get us toward towards the goal rather
[00:04:30] than just wandering around aimlessly for
[00:04:33] years and we can answer this question of
[00:04:36] am I moving in the right direction with
[00:04:38] the rail framework here's how it works
[00:04:40] in the first stage of learning any
[00:04:43] complex skill we're pretty clueless we
[00:04:46] have no idea where to start we don't
[00:04:48] know how to think about it we don't even
[00:04:49] know what questions to ask because we
[00:04:51] don't know enough to even ask questions
[00:04:53] and this is a huge problem because it
[00:04:55] means we don't know where to put our
[00:04:57] effort and attention because I'm a
[00:04:58] learning coach I'm going to use learning
[00:05:00] to learn as an example most people have
[00:05:02] no idea really where to start increasing
[00:05:05] their learning efficiency and they come
[00:05:06] in with a bunch of misconceptions about
[00:05:08] learning like just thinking that more
[00:05:10] hours studying is the key to success and
[00:05:12] even in my training program that I can
[00:05:14] study where people are actually trying
[00:05:16] to upgrade their studying techniques it
[00:05:18] is not uncommon for me to see someone
[00:05:21] skip a technique because they don't
[00:05:23] think it's important or relevant for
[00:05:24] them when actually it might be literally
[00:05:28] the most important thing that they could
[00:05:31] possibly be working on we don't know
[00:05:33] what we don't know and trying to improve
[00:05:36] anything without knowing where to direct
[00:05:39] our effort is the biggest time waste of
[00:05:42] all but this is the first stage of
[00:05:44] learning a new skill it is the r of rail
[00:05:47] and it stands for
[00:05:50] relevance because improving at this
[00:05:53] stage means understanding what is
[00:05:56] relevant for you and what is worth
[00:05:58] caring about so how do you know you're
[00:05:59] at the relevance stage number one you'll
[00:06:01] feel generally lost and confused about
[00:06:04] where to begin you either can't think of
[00:06:07] many things to work on or experiment
[00:06:09] with or there seem to be so many things
[00:06:13] to work on and experiment with that it's
[00:06:15] overwhelming AKA we don't know what to
[00:06:17] care about yet you'll know you're making
[00:06:19] progress through this relevance stage
[00:06:22] when you start realizing more variables
[00:06:24] to think and care about and things that
[00:06:27] seemed irrelevant before now become
[00:06:30] relevant for learning to learn these
[00:06:32] variables might be things like
[00:06:34] understanding what creates Active
[00:06:36] Learning or being able to assess your
[00:06:38] cognitive load or learning about
[00:06:40] different orders of learning or
[00:06:42] understanding how encoding affects
[00:06:43] retrieval so as you progress through the
[00:06:45] relevance stage you're not actually
[00:06:47] getting any better at the skill like you
[00:06:50] can't do it properly yet and you're
[00:06:52] certainly not getting any results for it
[00:06:54] but you are still progressing and that's
[00:06:58] the key so how do we make this progress
[00:07:00] well the actions that help you progress
[00:07:02] through the relevance stage are number
[00:07:04] one exploration and two challenging
[00:07:07] exploration means that we're spending
[00:07:09] time to understand the skill talk to
[00:07:12] people that are already good at it what
[00:07:13] do they say you should be thinking about
[00:07:16] and caring about get a diverse range of
[00:07:18] opinions spend some time to learn more
[00:07:20] about the theory what are the other
[00:07:22] variables that you should be thinking
[00:07:24] about challenging means that we're being
[00:07:27] open-minded and challenging our own
[00:07:29] beliefs or assumptions like I mentioned
[00:07:31] with learning to learn a lot of people
[00:07:33] think that a certain technique is what
[00:07:35] they need to get better but in reality
[00:07:38] what's really holding them back might be
[00:07:40] another variable that they haven't
[00:07:42] considered or don't think is very
[00:07:43] important like the way that they're
[00:07:44] practicing or how they're managing their
[00:07:46] time and the only way that we can really
[00:07:48] find out what matters is to be
[00:07:50] open-minded to the idea that what we
[00:07:53] think is important right now might not
[00:07:57] be correct now learning to learn is one
[00:08:00] of the most important skills that you
[00:08:02] can Master because it makes learning
[00:08:04] everything else in your life much easier
[00:08:06] however it is probably one of the most
[00:08:08] challenging skills to learn because it
[00:08:10] is an incredibly long latent learning
[00:08:13] period and seeing people trying to learn
[00:08:15] to learn and struggling and stressing
[00:08:18] because they don't know where to start
[00:08:20] is not only really sad but it's very
[00:08:22] frustrating for me because it is so much
[00:08:26] easier when you know what to care about
[00:08:29] so to help you with this I've created a
[00:08:32] free learning system health check quiz
[00:08:35] for you it's a free quiz that you can
[00:08:37] take that will evaluate your learning
[00:08:39] system and score you out of a 100 but
[00:08:42] more importantly you'll get a
[00:08:43] personalized report that will give you
[00:08:44] which components you're doing well on
[00:08:46] and then which parts that are holding
[00:08:48] you back from being a learning Master
[00:08:50] now for learning to learn this quiz
[00:08:52] should probably get you almost to the
[00:08:55] end of stage one of rail and it only
[00:08:58] takes like 10 minutes FYI it took me
[00:09:02] like 2 years to get to the end of stage
[00:09:04] one uh because I had no one to teach me
[00:09:07] and I was literally spending like
[00:09:08] thousands of hours reading research
[00:09:10] papers and thinking about the way that I
[00:09:12] learned for some people they never reach
[00:09:15] the end of stage one for their entire
[00:09:17] lives but you can now skip all that I've
[00:09:18] got the link to the quiz in the
[00:09:20] description below so anyway we're now at
[00:09:21] the end of stage one relevance we know
[00:09:24] what to care about we know what the
[00:09:26] variables are what now well this is the
[00:09:29] part in skill acquisition research which
[00:09:31] is called the plateau period it's often
[00:09:34] the part where most people give up in
[00:09:36] the second stage of learning a skill we
[00:09:38] are trying to perform the skill but we
[00:09:41] are consistently failing sometimes we
[00:09:43] know why we failed and sometimes we
[00:09:45] don't we continuously make mistakes and
[00:09:47] we don't seem to be making any clear
[00:09:49] progress this is why it's called the
[00:09:50] plateau period it's frustrating and
[00:09:52] demotivating and so this is when a lot
[00:09:55] of people will give up but not if you
[00:09:59] know the framework because the second
[00:10:00] stage is the awareness
[00:10:03] stage as in we're becoming more aware of
[00:10:07] our mistakes and the key sign that
[00:10:09] you're in this stage is that you are
[00:10:11] trying and making mistakes hopefully
[00:10:14] lots of mistakes think of it like a
[00:10:16] checklist let's say to learn a skill
[00:10:18] correctly you need to make a 100
[00:10:21] mistakes in order to finally be able to
[00:10:23] do it correctly for the first time in
[00:10:25] that case progress is about making as
[00:10:28] many of those mistakes as quickly as
[00:10:31] possible so making mistakes doesn't feel
[00:10:33] good but it is helpful and necessary
[00:10:37] once you know how to overcome the
[00:10:39] mistakes doing it correctly happens by
[00:10:42] default a lot of people go through my
[00:10:44] program hold off on practicing new
[00:10:46] techniques because they're afraid of
[00:10:48] making mistakes and getting it wrong
[00:10:50] they can spend days or even weeks just
[00:10:53] thinking about it and asking questions
[00:10:55] to try to avoid every possible mistake
[00:10:57] they can think of and then by the time
[00:10:58] it comes to give it a go the head is so
[00:11:01] full of things to try to avoid that they
[00:11:03] become overwhelmed and paralyzed on the
[00:11:06] other hand people who recognize the
[00:11:08] value of learning from mistakes can give
[00:11:10] things a go and pick up a new skill
[00:11:12] within days so as you progress through
[00:11:14] the awareness stage again you're still
[00:11:17] not doing it correctly yet and you're
[00:11:19] still not seeing good results but you
[00:11:22] are progressing by becoming more aware
[00:11:24] of the mistakes you tend to make so how
[00:11:26] can you progress through the awareness
[00:11:28] stage more quickly the two actions here
[00:11:30] are experimentation and reflection
[00:11:32] experimentation is about trying to
[00:11:35] perform the skill correctly and probably
[00:11:37] making mistakes reflection is about
[00:11:38] thinking what those mistakes were and
[00:11:41] why you made them we can then try a new
[00:11:43] experiment based on that reflection to
[00:11:45] try to overcome that mistake if it was a
[00:11:47] repeated mistake that you already knew
[00:11:49] about you think well what am I missing
[00:11:52] what's the variable that I haven't
[00:11:54] considered and if you don't even know
[00:11:55] what your mistake was in the first place
[00:11:57] you need to get feedback from someone
[00:11:59] who who does know and everyone needs
[00:12:01] feedback even the highest performing
[00:12:03] athletes in the world have coaches to
[00:12:05] give them feedback like I said we don't
[00:12:07] know what we don't know awareness is
[00:12:09] about knowing more things so that we can
[00:12:11] overcome them and it's hard to gain
[00:12:13] awareness when you're going through it
[00:12:14] alone so as you move through this second
[00:12:17] stage of awareness we are making less
[00:12:20] and less mistakes and at a certain point
[00:12:22] there are no more mistakes we're making
[00:12:25] this is the sign that we're nearing the
[00:12:26] end of stage two now you might think at
[00:12:29] this point we're done we've learned the
[00:12:31] skill we're not making any mistakes time
[00:12:33] to move on with my life but
[00:12:34] unfortunately not we're now only
[00:12:37] entering into stage three of four and
[00:12:40] stage three is another point at which
[00:12:42] many people tend to give up now before
[00:12:44] we get into stage three it's important
[00:12:46] to know why rail even works and it's
[00:12:50] because it's derived from another widely
[00:12:52] studied model called the four stages of
[00:12:55] competence in this original model the
[00:12:57] stages are called un conscious
[00:12:59] incompetence conscious incompetence
[00:13:01] conscious competence and unconscious
[00:13:04] competence and I love this model and I
[00:13:06] even teach it in my program but the
[00:13:08] reason I'm teaching you rail is because
[00:13:10] the four stages of competence is very
[00:13:12] dense and there are a lot of nuances
[00:13:14] it's also a little abstract and it
[00:13:16] doesn't actually tell you what you need
[00:13:17] to do to progress through the stages the
[00:13:20] reason I developed rail is so that you'd
[00:13:22] have something that's a little more
[00:13:24] practical especially for stage three and
[00:13:27] that's because stage three can be even
[00:13:29] more demotivating than stage two if you
[00:13:32] don't have rail so at stage three we
[00:13:34] finally overcome our mistakes we've
[00:13:37] learned how to do the skill correctly
[00:13:40] however it takes a lot of effort we're
[00:13:43] not very consistent and it's pretty slow
[00:13:46] and that's because it's a brand new
[00:13:48] skill because it's brand new it's slower
[00:13:51] and takes more effort than our previous
[00:13:53] habits and how we used to do things and
[00:13:54] in the early part of stage three our
[00:13:57] consistency is so bad that out of 10
[00:13:59] attempts we might only get it correct
[00:14:02] two or three times which is why stage
[00:14:04] three is called
[00:14:06] iteration and you know you're in stage
[00:14:08] three when you've been able to perform
[00:14:09] the technique correctly at least one or
[00:14:12] two times and you're not discovering any
[00:14:15] new mistakes but you're struggling to
[00:14:17] overcome all of them every time you know
[00:14:20] you're progressing through stage three
[00:14:22] when with each cycle or iteration you
[00:14:25] feel that your consistency is improving
[00:14:28] and you're able to do the technique
[00:14:30] correctly a higher percentage of the
[00:14:32] time you're starting to feel that it's
[00:14:34] becoming easier to do it and it requires
[00:14:37] less effort and you're getting faster as
[00:14:39] well and it must be in that order if you
[00:14:43] try to go faster when you don't have the
[00:14:45] consistency and accuracy yet you're just
[00:14:47] going to be increasing your error rate
[00:14:49] this is a common reason for demotivation
[00:14:51] and why people might give up at this
[00:14:53] stage so to progress through this stage
[00:14:55] more quickly we want to take these two
[00:14:57] actions which is varied practice and
[00:15:00] adjust so varied practice isn't just
[00:15:03] performing the skill again and again
[00:15:04] it's actually about performing the skill
[00:15:06] in different levels of challenge
[00:15:07] different context and different
[00:15:09] conditions if you're learning a new
[00:15:10] study technique you want to apply it to
[00:15:13] lots of different subjects with
[00:15:15] different volumes of workload through
[00:15:17] different mediums and different
[00:15:18] difficulties it just means you're
[00:15:20] observing how your consistency changes
[00:15:23] in each of these different contexts and
[00:15:25] levels of difficulty adjusting involves
[00:15:27] fine-tuning your technique so that you
[00:15:30] can maintain your consistency even when
[00:15:32] the situation isn't optimal for example
[00:15:35] how do you adjust your technique for
[00:15:36] different subjects or for when you're
[00:15:38] tired or when you don't have as much
[00:15:40] time to study again I'm using study
[00:15:41] techniques as an example here but you
[00:15:43] can use this for literally any other
[00:15:44] skill and after enough iterations you'll
[00:15:46] notice that you're able to perform the
[00:15:48] skill with a high level of consistency
[00:15:51] with a low level of effort and you're
[00:15:53] able to do it very fast this means
[00:15:55] you've entered the final stage of rail
[00:15:58] and it's when when your new skill has
[00:16:00] become a new habit it's just as easy as
[00:16:03] any other habit and in fact it actually
[00:16:04] takes effort to do it differently at
[00:16:07] this stage the actions to take are not
[00:16:08] so much about improving the technique
[00:16:10] but about refining it to make it better
[00:16:13] if it needs to be and regularly using it
[00:16:16] because if you don't use it enough you
[00:16:18] will lose it this is a phenomenon called
[00:16:21] skill Decay and it can happen for any
[00:16:23] skill that's neglected and it causes us
[00:16:25] to slip down into the earlier stages of
[00:16:28] rail and because stage four is about
[00:16:31] keeping your skills for life it is
[00:16:34] called the lifelong stage so you can now
[00:16:37] use ra to figure out what stage you're
[00:16:39] in see whether the actions You' have
[00:16:41] been taking to learn a new complex skill
[00:16:44] have been aligned for the stage you're
[00:16:46] at and start taking the right action to
[00:16:49] progress you to the next stage more
[00:16:50] quickly and if you're wanting to get a
[00:16:51] head start on the rail framework for one
[00:16:54] of the most complex and important skills
[00:16:56] that you can ever learn AKA learning to

=== 3 Levels of Mind Maps Every Student MUST Master ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8RxHtoLVTk

[00:00:00] mind mapping can be broken down into
[00:00:01] three different levels of skill when
[00:00:04] mind mapping is done at a skill level of
[00:00:06] level three it's legitimately one of the
[00:00:08] most powerful learning techniques that
[00:00:10] you can Master it improves your memory
[00:00:12] it increases your processing speed it
[00:00:14] makes it easier to think about more
[00:00:17] content more deeply but when mind
[00:00:19] mapping is done at level one it can be a
[00:00:22] complete waste of time for me being able
[00:00:24] to do a level three mind map every time
[00:00:27] is a big part of what gave me the
[00:00:29] confidence to run a business full-time
[00:00:31] while going through medical school and
[00:00:33] then later my full-time Masters for
[00:00:35] which I ranked first in my year now the
[00:00:37] first step and actually being able to
[00:00:39] level up your mind mapping is to be able
[00:00:41] to look at a mind map and identify what
[00:00:44] level it's at once we can figure out the
[00:00:46] difference between the different levels
[00:00:48] of mindmap we can then focus on the
[00:00:49] processes that help us Bridge each of
[00:00:52] these levels so I'll show you some
[00:00:53] examples of each level of my maps see if
[00:00:56] you can Spot the Difference so these
[00:00:57] ones are level one
[00:00:59] [Music]
[00:01:02] and then these ones here are level
[00:01:07] two and these are some level
[00:01:16] three now you might think that the main
[00:01:18] difference is that a level three mind
[00:01:20] map just looks simpler or more
[00:01:23] comprehensive but it is so much more
[00:01:26] than that and the difference between a
[00:01:27] level one and a level three is probably
[00:01:30] the difference that separates a top 30%
[00:01:33] learner from a top 1% learner but before
[00:01:35] we get into that let's take a deep dive
[00:01:37] into level one so here's the example of
[00:01:39] the level one mind map again now the
[00:01:43] level one mind map has two important
[00:01:45] characteristics the first thing is that
[00:01:48] it has
[00:01:49] nonlinearity of ideas so if you have a
[00:01:52] look at this you can see that it's not
[00:01:54] just going left to right down the page
[00:01:56] uh all of these things it's trying to
[00:01:57] represent the ideas spatially around the
[00:02:01] page and second thing is that there are
[00:02:03] connections between the ideas uh you can
[00:02:06] see that they're trying to express these
[00:02:08] connections with these lines and arrows
[00:02:10] now the difference is actually a lot
[00:02:11] more obvious when we go back a level to
[00:02:14] what's even before level one which is
[00:02:17] level zero note taking and level zero
[00:02:20] note taking looks a little bit more like
[00:02:23] this and these are actually my old notes
[00:02:27] from like over 10 years ago go and I can
[00:02:30] tell you that the thousands of hours I
[00:02:33] spent on writing notes like these were
[00:02:36] ultimately a waste of time so at level
[00:02:38] zero there are five characteristics that
[00:02:41] you should definitely avoid firstly it's
[00:02:44] very linear uh secondly it's usually
[00:02:47] very wordy and thirdly it's pretty
[00:02:50] superficial uh it doesn't go into the
[00:02:52] content very deeply it doesn't really
[00:02:54] look at how ideas are related to each
[00:02:56] other because frankly trying to write
[00:02:58] that all down through level zero linear
[00:03:00] note taking would be completely
[00:03:02] overwhelming there's often a lot of
[00:03:03] highlighting and sometimes there's a lot
[00:03:05] of annotating and at the end of the day
[00:03:07] it is uselessly timec consuming in that
[00:03:09] it takes a lot of time but it's not
[00:03:12] really helping with our retention or our
[00:03:14] depth of understanding so level one
[00:03:16] really represents this first point where
[00:03:18] someone's trying to break this old
[00:03:20] linear mold but the important thing is
[00:03:23] not to just recognize the
[00:03:25] characteristics of each level it's to
[00:03:27] know what the process is that takes you
[00:03:29] from level zero to level one and there
[00:03:32] are three key
[00:03:34] processes that someone is engaging in to
[00:03:37] go from Level Zer to level one the first
[00:03:39] process is that they're looking at how
[00:03:42] they can use arrows and lines to
[00:03:46] represent information instead of just
[00:03:48] writing it out as full sentences so no
[00:03:51] full
[00:03:53] sentences the second thing is that we're
[00:03:56] trying to cut down on how wordy it is
[00:03:59] we're often doing a little bit more
[00:04:03] summarizing and the third part is
[00:04:06] getting a little bit more comfortable
[00:04:08] with just representing information
[00:04:11] spatially and without using
[00:04:16] words when we follow these processes we
[00:04:18] go from Level zero to level one now at
[00:04:23] level one we're not really getting a
[00:04:26] strong benefit from mindmapping the real
[00:04:28] power of Mind mapping comes comes from
[00:04:30] level two and level three and in fact
[00:04:31] level one often looks pretty messy
[00:04:35] however level one is not bad mind
[00:04:39] mapping is a skill and like any other
[00:04:41] skill there are levels to that skill and
[00:04:43] you can't just skip a level level one is
[00:04:47] necessary because it allows us to break
[00:04:49] out from Level zero to then work towards
[00:04:52] level two it's kind of like training
[00:04:54] wheels on a bicycle and a lot of people
[00:04:56] will say oh I gave mind mapping a go it
[00:04:58] didn't really work for me but they
[00:05:00] actually only reached level one and
[00:05:02] you're right if you only reached level
[00:05:04] one it's not really going to work for
[00:05:05] you so let's have a look at level two
[00:05:07] where you should see some benefit here's
[00:05:09] an example of the level two mind maps
[00:05:12] again and once we're at this level two
[00:05:14] skill we should be feeling a lot more
[00:05:17] comfortable with expressing information
[00:05:19] nonlinearly and at level two there are
[00:05:21] three characteristics to look out for
[00:05:24] first of all we have groups of
[00:05:26] information and these groups are related
[00:05:29] to each other and as a result there is a
[00:05:32] clearer flow or structure to the
[00:05:35] information you can see these groups
[00:05:38] being represented uh here in the brown
[00:05:41] uh as well as the flow of information
[00:05:43] with the arrows being a little bit
[00:05:45] cleaner and if your mind map has these
[00:05:47] characteristics it's probably at level
[00:05:50] two and by the way let me know what
[00:05:52] level you are in the comments so that I
[00:05:54] can help cater my future videos to you
[00:05:56] so now that we know what a level two
[00:05:58] mind map looks like let's think about
[00:06:00] what the processes are that take us from
[00:06:03] level one to level two there are again
[00:06:06] three main processes that we want to
[00:06:09] focus on here the first one is that
[00:06:11] we're thinking a little bit more about
[00:06:14] how ideas are similar or different to
[00:06:17] each
[00:06:21] other and by thinking about how similar
[00:06:23] things are to each other this allows us
[00:06:25] to put them into groups we're arranging
[00:06:27] them by those similar ities number two
[00:06:30] we're now thinking about how the
[00:06:32] information actually
[00:06:34] flows and influences each
[00:06:38] other we've created these groups we've
[00:06:41] looked at how things might be related
[00:06:42] and similar to each other and we're
[00:06:43] thinking how do these ideas connect
[00:06:46] together in a coherent structure which
[00:06:48] leads to number three we're actually
[00:06:50] thinking about
[00:06:52] intentionally creating more of a
[00:06:57] structure as opposed to for example just
[00:06:59] drawing a bunch of lines and arrows
[00:07:01] connecting things all over the place and
[00:07:03] overall the the difference between level
[00:07:05] one and level two the major difference
[00:07:07] is that we're spending a lot more time
[00:07:10] thinking about how we want to arrange
[00:07:13] the information and organize it as
[00:07:15] opposed to just getting used to
[00:07:17] organizing it nonlinearly and by
[00:07:20] thinking about how to organize the
[00:07:22] information in level two and later also
[00:07:25] in level three we're forcing our brain
[00:07:27] to engage in that higher order think
[00:07:29] which is one of the most important
[00:07:32] cognitive processes that you can do to
[00:07:35] understand remember and apply what you
[00:07:37] learned properly in fact the oecd has
[00:07:41] even come out with a statement saying
[00:07:42] that higher order thinking skills is one
[00:07:45] of the most crucial things that a
[00:07:48] modernday learner needs to know to be
[00:07:51] successful so what that means is that if
[00:07:53] you are mindmapping and you're not
[00:07:55] noticing improvements in your
[00:07:57] understanding or your memory or your
[00:07:58] ability to apply the information it
[00:08:00] probably means that you're not engaging
[00:08:03] at that higher order of thinking and
[00:08:06] that would be common because most people
[00:08:10] tend to avoid higher order thinking
[00:08:13] since it takes more mental effort and it
[00:08:15] can feel uncomfortable which basically
[00:08:17] means most people are avoiding the type
[00:08:20] of thinking that helps build stronger
[00:08:23] memory and deeper understanding in the
[00:08:25] first place this is famously called the
[00:08:27] misinterpreted iFit hypothesis which
[00:08:28] I've talked about in lots of my other
[00:08:30] videos and this is important because
[00:08:31] there's essentially no point in using
[00:08:33] mind mapping as a technique if we're not
[00:08:36] engaging in the right type of thinking
[00:08:38] and it's actually really easy to
[00:08:40] demonstrate the difference between level
[00:08:43] zero level one and level two so I'll
[00:08:46] show you using this article on
[00:08:48] metacognition which is just taken from
[00:08:50] Wikipedia it could be from a textbook or
[00:08:52] from lecture slides uh it doesn't really
[00:08:53] matter this is just a demonstration so
[00:08:55] at level zero let me show you what my
[00:08:58] note taking would look like I'll type it
[00:09:00] out for you so you don't have to
[00:09:01] struggle reading through my handwriting
[00:09:03] so as I'm running these notes all I'm
[00:09:04] doing is I'm reading a sentence I'm
[00:09:07] summarizing it a little I'm transcribing
[00:09:09] it down honestly I may as well have just
[00:09:11] used chat gbt or something to do this
[00:09:13] because it takes no mental effort and my
[00:09:16] brain is almost asleep uh no real
[00:09:20] learning is happening in the
[00:09:22] brain now there actually is a way to
[00:09:25] still do linear notes while still
[00:09:28] getting level three results uh and I'll
[00:09:31] show you that one later okay so I'll
[00:09:34] just end that demonstration there
[00:09:35] because I'm losing brain Styles let me
[00:09:37] do the same passage at level
[00:09:43] one and so here as I'm writing I'm
[00:09:45] mentally doing the same thing I'm
[00:09:47] basically just reading a sentence I'm
[00:09:49] summarizing it a little uh maybe a
[00:09:52] little bit more concisely and then I'm
[00:09:53] just writing it down and I'm basically
[00:09:56] just looking to see if it's connect to
[00:09:59] anything else really obviously and I'm
[00:10:02] putting some lines and arrows
[00:10:04] down as we are progressing you can see
[00:10:08] it's starting to get a little messy and
[00:10:12] honestly like it's already kind of
[00:10:14] overwhelming in terms of just there's a
[00:10:16] lot of lines and arrows going everywhere
[00:10:19] um and this is usually when a lot of
[00:10:20] students will say it's not working since
[00:10:22] it might actually feel worse than just
[00:10:24] linear nodes which were at least easier
[00:10:26] to read but anyway that was level one
[00:10:30] same content same stuff but done through
[00:10:33] level one mind mapping and you can see
[00:10:35] some similarities with the examples that
[00:10:36] I showed you before so now let's do
[00:10:38] level two exactly the same content again
[00:10:42] now here there's a big difference in
[00:10:44] thinking compared to before because
[00:10:46] instead of just going sentence by
[00:10:48] sentence and putting it down I'm
[00:10:49] actually uh reading more I'm actually
[00:10:52] thinking about it back and forth I'm
[00:10:54] actively deciding how I want to
[00:10:56] structure this information in a way that
[00:10:59] makes sense and I'm also actively trying
[00:11:01] to group related ideas together you can
[00:11:03] see it's looking tidier it's there's
[00:11:06] more groups it's a little bit easier to
[00:11:08] follow and it's actually a lot more
[00:11:09] engaging in fact it's actually even a
[00:11:12] little bit fun and I can feel that the
[00:11:14] information uh sticks in my head a lot
[00:11:17] more easily while at level zero and then
[00:11:19] level one I barely remember what I wrote
[00:11:22] down uh also it's a little hard to see
[00:11:23] from the video but the time I spent just
[00:11:26] thinking about what to write before even
[00:11:29] writing anything down in the first place
[00:11:31] is a lot longer so at level zero and
[00:11:33] level one I'm I'm basically writing
[00:11:35] something every 5 or 10 seconds I'm
[00:11:37] pretty much writing Non-Stop and at
[00:11:39] level two I'm thinking about things for
[00:11:41] like you know 20 or 30 seconds or even
[00:11:44] more before even writing it down because
[00:11:46] I'm just trying to think about how I
[00:11:48] want to arrange it that's actually um
[00:11:51] one really good way to see if you're
[00:11:53] thinking about things enough to learn
[00:11:55] effectively it shouldn't really be
[00:11:58] possible to think at level two depth and
[00:12:02] also write constantly so that is level
[00:12:06] two and now going from Level zero to
[00:12:08] level two is probably enough to give you
[00:12:11] a decent little grade bump of like 10 to
[00:12:14] 15% but level three is where you start
[00:12:17] seeing some serious improvements now
[00:12:20] before we go into what a level three
[00:12:22] mind map looks like I just want to
[00:12:23] preface by saying that my mapping is a
[00:12:26] complex skill it took me like over a
[00:12:29] decade of trial and error and reading
[00:12:32] research to really Master it and I'm
[00:12:34] glad that I did because I'm able to save
[00:12:36] time for you uh with videos like these
[00:12:39] but what about other skills that are not
[00:12:41] mind mapping brilliant question and
[00:12:43] Brilliant is the answer brilliant is a
[00:12:46] sponsor of today's video and it is where
[00:12:47] you learn by doing you learn by
[00:12:50] experimenting solving problems making
[00:12:52] mistakes and learning from them there
[00:12:55] have thousands of interactive lessons on
[00:12:57] subjects like data analysis math math
[00:12:59] programming and AI brilliant helps you
[00:13:01] to build knowledge that you can learn
[00:13:03] and then apply within minutes you can
[00:13:05] also fit it in whenever you've got time
[00:13:07] which helps to build a habit of learning
[00:13:08] something useful every single day and
[00:13:10] their Hands-On problem solving approach
[00:13:12] makes it much faster and more fun than
[00:13:15] the traditional boring old lesson it's
[00:13:17] an opportunity to train your critical
[00:13:19] thinking and real world problem solving
[00:13:22] skills which are part of those crucial
[00:13:24] higher order thinking skills that I
[00:13:27] mentioned earlier as opposed to the
[00:13:29] normal kind of pointless memorization
[00:13:31] which is very lower order brilliant has
[00:13:34] recently launched a bunch of new lessons
[00:13:36] on data analysis and probability which
[00:13:39] is a subject that I'm personally pretty
[00:13:41] interested about it uses real world data
[00:13:43] and trains you on how to find Trends to
[00:13:46] make better decisions it's perfect for
[00:13:47] Learners at any level and you also get
[00:13:50] to see the real data from companies like
[00:13:53] Starbucks X and Spotify to try
[00:13:55] everything that brilliant has to offer

[00:14:07] that link now let's dive back into the
[00:14:09] level three mind maps which is where the
[00:14:11] real power of mind maps comes in here's
[00:14:14] an example of my maps at level three
[00:14:16] again and there are three
[00:14:18] characteristics that you need to know uh
[00:14:21] at level three the first thing is that
[00:14:23] the structure and flow is much clearer
[00:14:26] you can clearly see uh where where the
[00:14:29] information is going throughout this map
[00:14:32] number two there's more emphasis to some
[00:14:34] groups and arrows over others for
[00:14:37] example you can see that these arrows
[00:14:39] are a little bit thicker compared to for
[00:14:40] example these arrows that visually
[00:14:42] indicates the importance of information
[00:14:44] and relationships and this last one is
[00:14:47] harder to notice but the groups
[00:14:49] themselves are more intuitive and easier
[00:14:53] to remember so if we kind of zoom in a
[00:14:55] little bit here we can see that the
[00:14:57] actual name of the the groups that have
[00:14:59] been used are not always the same
[00:15:02] terminology that is taught for the topic
[00:15:05] they've actually relabeled the group so
[00:15:07] it makes more sense for them at an
[00:15:09] intuitive level it's actually easier to
[00:15:12] understand the difference between level
[00:15:13] two and three by talking about the
[00:15:15] processes that we need to engage in to
[00:15:18] go from level two to level three now by
[00:15:21] the time we're at a level three skill
[00:15:23] we're used to writing nonlinear notes
[00:15:26] we're used to thinking about how things
[00:15:28] are similar we're used to grouping
[00:15:30] things together we're used to creating
[00:15:32] structures and flows what we're focusing
[00:15:34] on with the process at level three is
[00:15:37] the quality so we're improving the
[00:15:39] quality of the connections and
[00:15:42] relationships that we're forming we're
[00:15:43] also increasing the quality and when I
[00:15:46] say quality I'm talking about how
[00:15:48] intuitive the groups that we're forming
[00:15:51] are yeah sure we can connect this group
[00:15:54] to this group we can connect these ideas
[00:15:56] to these other ideas we can group these
[00:15:58] things together sure but which way of
[00:16:02] grouping is actually the best for us
[00:16:06] which makes the most sense which is the
[00:16:08] most intuitive which feels like it's
[00:16:10] going to be stickier in our memory which
[00:16:12] means number three we have to spend time
[00:16:15] to identify Alternatives and then make
[00:16:18] an actual judgment on which one is the
[00:16:22] best for example here's that little map
[00:16:24] that I made before at level two and then
[00:16:27] here is the exact same map with
[00:16:30] essentially the exact same information
[00:16:32] but just grouped and structured
[00:16:35] differently so at level three I'm
[00:16:37] actually thinking about these
[00:16:39] alternative ways of structuring the
[00:16:41] information and arranging them in a way
[00:16:43] that makes more sense to me at level
[00:16:45] three our mind maps are becoming cleaner
[00:16:48] more intuitive more deliberate the lines
[00:16:51] and the arrows and everything that I'm
[00:16:53] putting on there is more intentional now
[00:16:55] for most people the difference between
[00:16:57] level two and level three
[00:16:59] uh may not seem like much after all
[00:17:01] we're still just grouping and organizing
[00:17:03] information but the difference between
[00:17:06] level two and level three in terms of
[00:17:08] how much it affects your performance and
[00:17:10] results and memory and depth of
[00:17:12] understanding is probably more than the
[00:17:15] difference between going from Level zero
[00:17:18] all the way through to level two being
[00:17:20] able to create a level three mind map
[00:17:23] consistently is very uncommon and
[00:17:26] probably translates to aough L top 10%
[00:17:30] level of performance in fact the type of
[00:17:34] thinking that you have to do for a level
[00:17:36] three mind map is so crucial that
[00:17:39] virtually any top 1 or 2% learner is
[00:17:42] going to be thinking in this way even if
[00:17:45] they're not using mind maps as the
[00:17:47] technique mentally they're engaging in
[00:17:51] those same higher order thinking
[00:17:53] processes and patterns which is why
[00:17:55] earlier I said that it is actually
[00:17:57] possible to do level zero uh linear note
[00:18:01] taking but still get level three types
[00:18:05] of results and let me show you how so
[00:18:08] just going back to my article on
[00:18:10] metacognition here I'm going to do the
[00:18:12] like pseudo level three note taking with
[00:18:14] linear notes uh here so as I do this
[00:18:17] just notice how I'm spending a lot of
[00:18:19] time reading and um and when I'm writing
[00:18:22] I'm not actually just reading things and
[00:18:25] writing things down I'm actually
[00:18:27] thinking about it and synthesizing it
[00:18:29] and I'm doing all of that higher order
[00:18:30] thinking and grouping and thinking about
[00:18:32] how things are related to each other I'm
[00:18:33] doing that all mentally as I read and
[00:18:35] then I'm writing down like my entire
[00:18:37] synthesis and structure so it's almost
[00:18:40] like a mini essay where I'm trying to
[00:18:42] explain all the relationships and
[00:18:43] nuances of the content that I've read
[00:18:46] and this is basically how you're able to
[00:18:48] get some people that are using what
[00:18:50] seems like a pretty mediocre method of
[00:18:53] note taking but they're getting great
[00:18:54] results because mentally what's going on
[00:18:56] is at a high level but there are two
[00:18:58] specific reasons that you should not do
[00:19:01] this first of all it's honestly just
[00:19:04] much harder than doing the level three
[00:19:07] mind map because I'm having to do all
[00:19:08] the thinking in my head and all the
[00:19:10] processing I can't track my thoughts and
[00:19:13] uh all the relationships that I'm
[00:19:15] thinking of on the mindmap so it's much
[00:19:19] much harder for me to actually create
[00:19:21] the connections and organize my thoughts
[00:19:23] being able to just literally write it
[00:19:26] down and brainstorm the ideas as I I go
[00:19:29] uh is probably two or even three times
[00:19:32] faster and easier than trying to do it
[00:19:35] all mentally and then just forcing it
[00:19:37] back down into a linear set of notes
[00:19:39] again this is actually also the reason
[00:19:40] why you should use mind maps to plan uh
[00:19:43] literature reviews and essays it's also
[00:19:46] probably two or three times more time
[00:19:49] consuming overall not just when I'm
[00:19:53] writing the notes but later when I go to
[00:19:55] review the notes I'm forcing myself to
[00:19:57] have to read through this entire thing
[00:20:00] all over again to extract the the
[00:20:03] meaning from it whereas if I had just
[00:20:05] the Mind map I can just glance at it to
[00:20:08] review the structure in like seconds or
[00:20:11] minutes and even though the Mind map
[00:20:12] looks simpler it's actually the same
[00:20:16] types of relationships and thoughts that
[00:20:19] as were in the essay the essay is not a
[00:20:22] more comprehensive set of notes at all
[00:20:26] in fact the essay probably doesn't even
[00:20:29] cover all of the relationships that I'd
[00:20:31] be able to express in the mindmap the
[00:20:34] level three mind map is
[00:20:36] incomparably simpler faster and more
[00:20:40] organized this synthesized essay writing
[00:20:42] thing that I just did you can use that
[00:20:44] as a revision technique later instead
[00:20:47] now if you found this video and you want
[00:20:49] even more to help you master the Art and
[00:20:52] Science of learning then I've got a free
[00:20:55] Weekly Newsletter that I've created
[00:20:57] where I've taken my decade of coaching
[00:21:00] and distilled what really works into
[00:21:03] bite-sized emails each email contains a
[00:21:05] key concept to help you improve your
[00:21:07] memory your depth of understanding your
[00:21:09] ability to apply your knowledge as well
[00:21:12] as a practical takeaway or a challenge
[00:21:14] it's completely free and the concepts
[00:21:16] that I talked about in this video are
[00:21:18] also included in one of those
[00:21:19] newsletters as well as other Concepts
[00:21:21] that I have never made any videos about
[00:21:23] if you're interested I'll leave a link

=== 6 Levels of Thinking Every Student MUST Master ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xqerXscTsE

[00:00:00] there are six levels or types of
[00:00:02] thinking that every student or learner
[00:00:05] of any age should master and each of
[00:00:07] these six levels leads to a different
[00:00:11] level of result unfortunately most of
[00:00:14] the students I work with stuck in these
[00:00:16] first few levels of thinking and the
[00:00:19] reason that they struggle to reach top
[00:00:21] results is because they are thinking at
[00:00:23] the wrong level when this happens it
[00:00:25] causes a lot of stress it wastes a lot
[00:00:27] of time it can be very frustrating it
[00:00:30] feel impossible to reach top results
[00:00:32] with any degree of confidence and with
[00:00:34] enough time we can start thinking that
[00:00:36] maybe we're just not cut out for it but
[00:00:39] that probably is not true and for me
[00:00:42] learning how to think deliberately at
[00:00:44] the right level is one of the main
[00:00:46] reasons I was able to achieve top
[00:00:48] academic results in both medical school
[00:00:50] and for my masters of education and
[00:00:52] trust me I'm certainly not a genius I've
[00:00:55] seen similar results with thousands of
[00:00:58] students and professionals that have
[00:00:59] trained over years and by the end of
[00:01:01] this video you'll be able to see what
[00:01:02] level you tend to operate at and how you
[00:01:05] can get to the level that you need to be
[00:01:06] and FYI the level you need to be is
[00:01:10] probably higher than you think but we'll
[00:01:13] get to that later so the first level is
[00:01:16] all about memorizing things this
[00:01:18] involves a lot of rereading uh rewriting
[00:01:22] it is usually very repetitive it can
[00:01:24] feel very tedious it often makes us feel
[00:01:27] drowsy and this level is called
[00:01:30] remember it is the level of roote
[00:01:33] learning and repeating hundreds and
[00:01:34] thousands of flash cards this is the way
[00:01:37] I and maybe you studied for like most of
[00:01:40] High School uh and it's maybe the reason
[00:01:43] why you might have hated studying and
[00:01:45] when you do this level of thinking and
[00:01:47] studying then it unlocks level one
[00:01:50] result which is
[00:01:53] regurgitate the regurgitate level is all
[00:01:56] about listing defining stating facts
[00:01:59] it's the kinds of questions that are
[00:02:02] less common as you go through our
[00:02:03] University and become semi useless in
[00:02:06] professional life confusingly even
[00:02:08] though this first level is called
[00:02:09] remember it's actually not a very good
[00:02:11] way to hold on to and retain the things
[00:02:14] that you learn uh but we'll talk about
[00:02:16] that later the second level of learning
[00:02:18] is about really trying to comprehend
[00:02:21] what you are learning rather than just
[00:02:23] like repeatedly smash it into your brain
[00:02:25] this is the level that we call
[00:02:28] understand now there's a reason I've
[00:02:31] been saying these are levels of thinking
[00:02:34] uh and not different levels of studying
[00:02:36] and that's because your intentions
[00:02:39] really matter you could have two people
[00:02:41] doing exactly the same technique and for
[00:02:44] someone looking at you it can look
[00:02:47] exactly the same and then when you ask
[00:02:48] them hey how are you studying they might
[00:02:51] both just say I'm just reading my
[00:02:53] textbook but mentally it's different for
[00:02:56] the person at level one by reading they
[00:02:59] actually mean mean I'm reading it again
[00:03:01] and again so I can try to get it stuck
[00:03:03] in my head whereas for the person in
[00:03:06] level two what they mean is I'm reading
[00:03:09] it so I can understand what it's trying
[00:03:11] to say and wrap my head around it and so
[00:03:13] naturally at level two thinking
[00:03:16] understand what we unlock is level two
[00:03:19] result which is
[00:03:22] explain this allows us to answer
[00:03:24] questions that require us to explain our
[00:03:27] understanding of a concept or a process
[00:03:29] these these types of questions often
[00:03:30] make up the bulk of most assessments up
[00:03:33] until around later in uni now if this is
[00:03:35] sounding familiar to you so far it's
[00:03:37] because it's described in a framework
[00:03:38] called Bloom's revised taxonomy which
[00:03:40] was first published in
[00:03:42] 1956 and then later revised in 2001 and
[00:03:45] even though it is 70 years old uh it is
[00:03:49] still one of the most underrated
[00:03:51] principle that most students have never
[00:03:53] heard of and if you have heard of it
[00:03:55] stick around because I'll teach you a
[00:03:56] way of using it that helped me double my
[00:03:58] learning efficiency so level three is
[00:04:01] about using what you have leared to then
[00:04:04] solve problems and this is a level that
[00:04:07] we call apply now this is where things
[00:04:10] can get a little bit confusing because a
[00:04:11] lot of people misunderstand this about
[00:04:13] Bloom's taxonomy there are lots of
[00:04:15] different ways that you can apply your
[00:04:17] knowledge to solve problems so for
[00:04:19] example you have what we I would say are
[00:04:22] simple problems uh these are the types
[00:04:24] of problems where you learn something
[00:04:26] and then you just directly use that
[00:04:28] thing that you learned to solve a
[00:04:29] problem so for example in math or
[00:04:31] physics you learn an equation or formula
[00:04:33] and there is a problem that you need to
[00:04:35] solve by just using that equation or
[00:04:37] formula then again there are what I
[00:04:40] might call a little bit more advanced
[00:04:42] problems and these are the ones where
[00:04:44] you actually have to think about the
[00:04:46] best way to tackle the problem there are
[00:04:48] a combination of Concepts that you need
[00:04:51] to apply in a certain sequence and
[00:04:53] there's a lot more strategic thinking
[00:04:55] involved at level three we're mostly
[00:04:59] talking about the first one simple
[00:05:02] problem solving and so we unlock that
[00:05:06] level which is the simple problem
[00:05:09] solving result we're now able to solve
[00:05:11] what I call One to One problems where
[00:05:14] there is one concept you learn and the
[00:05:17] problem requires that one concept to
[00:05:19] solve and you can get to this level
[00:05:21] level three by just literally solving
[00:05:25] questions and solving problems lots of
[00:05:27] practice papers and quizzes have
[00:05:30] questions at the apply level for
[00:05:32] something more procedural like coding it
[00:05:34] might be building a simple function with
[00:05:36] a few simple variables but what about
[00:05:38] the harder and more complex questions
[00:05:41] the types of problems that are Advanced
[00:05:43] this is where level four thinking comes
[00:05:46] in we're entering into the territory of
[00:05:48] higher order learning people who know
[00:05:51] how to think at level four tend to do
[00:05:54] pretty well but level four thinkers are
[00:05:57] not common and you'll see why why that
[00:05:59] is soon level four thinking is all about
[00:06:02] comparing and contrasting it's about
[00:06:05] looking for similarities and differences
[00:06:07] we call this level analyze it's the
[00:06:10] first time that we're not just looking
[00:06:12] at information by itself but we're
[00:06:14] looking at it in relation to another
[00:06:16] piece of information and there are
[00:06:18] countless techniques that help with
[00:06:20] level four analyze Vin diagrams making
[00:06:24] tables making summaries that explain the
[00:06:26] similarities and differences using mind
[00:06:28] maps so in problems and questions that
[00:06:31] force you to compare one Concept in
[00:06:33] relation to another all of these things
[00:06:35] are going to be helpful really any
[00:06:38] technique is effective as long as it
[00:06:42] forces you to compare and contrast one
[00:06:46] thing against another thing so unlocking
[00:06:49] level four accesses the level four
[00:06:53] result which is the comparison level and
[00:06:57] instead of just giving you some examples
[00:06:58] of what comparison looks like like I'm
[00:06:59] going to do one bit and show you this
[00:07:02] great little study tip that you can use
[00:07:04] go on to something like chbt or Gemini
[00:07:07] and type in this prompt give me
[00:07:10] questions at the educational stage that
[00:07:13] you want so let's say second year
[00:07:15] university level for the subject so
[00:07:19] let's say in this example we'll say uh
[00:07:23] microbiology at blooms revised taxonomy
[00:07:29] level in this case it's going to be
[00:07:30] level four and these are exactly the
[00:07:33] types of questions that test you at
[00:07:35] level four and you'll see that every
[00:07:37] single option forces you to compare
[00:07:39] ideas against each other now the reason
[00:07:42] that this technique is actually useful
[00:07:44] to use in your studying is because
[00:07:46] Bloom's revised taxonomy was not created
[00:07:49] for people like you like a learner they
[00:07:53] were created for educators and exam
[00:07:56] writers and internationally almost every
[00:07:59] single curriculum is designed around
[00:08:03] Bloom's taxonomy or a similar taxonomy
[00:08:06] they're all pretty similar to each other
[00:08:07] which means your exam writer is thinking
[00:08:10] in this way to create the questions that
[00:08:13] are going to filter out the good versus
[00:08:15] the great Learners which means you can
[00:08:17] now predict the types of questions
[00:08:20] they're going to ask you and even create
[00:08:21] your own practice papers but here is why
[00:08:25] level four thinkers are not common as
[00:08:29] soon as you jump from level three to
[00:08:33] level four you will 100% notice that
[00:08:37] this level of thinking requires more
[00:08:40] mental effort it is harder to do you're
[00:08:42] thinking for longer and more deeply than
[00:08:45] the previous levels which is a good
[00:08:47] thing because it means that your brain
[00:08:48] is forming deeper knowledge and stronger
[00:08:50] memory but it can feel like you've
[00:08:53] gotten slower and some people think that
[00:08:56] that means they're doing something wrong
[00:08:58] so even though most students can think
[00:09:01] at level four most students choose not
[00:09:04] to because it doesn't feel as easy this
[00:09:08] is a phenomenon called the
[00:09:09] misinterpreted effort hypothesis and it
[00:09:13] prevents the majority of Learners from
[00:09:15] ever really improving and this is even
[00:09:18] more the case at level five level five
[00:09:21] thinking is for the top Learners if you
[00:09:23] can think at level five you will be
[00:09:25] reaching those top results it's also the
[00:09:28] level that people find the most
[00:09:30] confusing so I'm going to make it really
[00:09:31] simple for you level five is all about
[00:09:36] Judgment at level four we analyzed we
[00:09:39] compared and contrasted we found
[00:09:41] similarities and differences at level
[00:09:44] five we're asking so what what does it
[00:09:47] matter who cares why is it important
[00:09:50] level five is called
[00:09:52] evaluate and learning to think at this
[00:09:55] level unlocks the level five result
[00:09:58] which is
[00:10:00] prioritize so let's do that little AI
[00:10:02] trick again and see the difference in
[00:10:04] the types of questions we get so you can
[00:10:07] see level four on the left and level
[00:10:08] five on the right so notice that at
[00:10:10] level five we are forming conclusions
[00:10:12] and now we have to justify it it's not
[00:10:14] enough like at level four just to know
[00:10:16] that there are similarities and
[00:10:18] differences we then have to use that
[00:10:20] knowledge to make a decision level five
[00:10:22] thinking takes much more effort uh and
[00:10:25] you'll know that you are doing it right
[00:10:27] when you are going back and forth
[00:10:29] between the material trying to answer
[00:10:31] the question in your head of why does
[00:10:34] this matter how does it fit in with
[00:10:35] everything else why do I need to care
[00:10:38] you're going to be jumping between your
[00:10:39] lectures and your textbook and doing a
[00:10:41] Google search these are the signs that
[00:10:43] you are operating at level five and it's
[00:10:45] not as easy as the previous levels but
[00:10:48] to reach level five results you need to
[00:10:51] go through this and level four and level
[00:10:54] five are the types of questions and
[00:10:55] challenges you'll find in second and
[00:10:57] third year university and Beyond on uh
[00:11:00] and in postgrad studies most of what
[00:11:02] you're assist at is level four and level
[00:11:05] five also pretty much any senior
[00:11:07] position in any profession will require
[00:11:11] you to have level four and level five
[00:11:12] thinking and much like before it's less
[00:11:14] about what your Technique looks like and
[00:11:17] more about what's happening inside your
[00:11:19] brain for example for level five mind
[00:11:22] maps uh teaching answering questions uh
[00:11:26] creating summaries these are all
[00:11:29] techniques that are great for level five
[00:11:33] but you could also do all of those
[00:11:36] techniques and still not do it at level
[00:11:40] five if you're not thinking in the right
[00:11:41] way for example it's easy to make a mind
[00:11:44] map just connecting a bunch of lines and
[00:11:45] arrows together between words forming a
[00:11:47] few groups and categories here and there
[00:11:49] and just call it done but that's not
[00:11:51] level five thinking it's very different
[00:11:53] to for example creating a mind map where
[00:11:56] you're critically evaluating which lines
[00:11:59] and relationships are more important
[00:12:01] than other possible relationships and
[00:12:03] you're thinking what is the best way I
[00:12:05] can group these ideas together mentally
[00:12:08] it's a very different process even
[00:12:10] though physically it can look very
[00:12:11] similar now level six I'll go through
[00:12:13] this one pretty quickly because finally
[00:12:15] enough it's actually less important for
[00:12:17] most people level six is about creating
[00:12:21] a hypothesis it's about synthesizing new
[00:12:24] and novel information from what you
[00:12:26] already know this level is called create
[00:12:29] and when you unlock create it unlocks
[00:12:31] the level six result which is
[00:12:34] hypothesize now some people think that
[00:12:36] level six create is any situation where
[00:12:39] you have to generate anything with your
[00:12:42] knowledge uh this is not true it's only
[00:12:44] level six if you are creating a answer
[00:12:50] for something that you don't think the
[00:12:53] answer exists in your knowledge already
[00:12:56] you're identifying a gap and you're
[00:12:58] creating a potential answer that makes
[00:13:01] sense based on what you do know and the
[00:13:03] reason level six is not as important as
[00:13:04] the previous levels is because most
[00:13:07] people will not really be assisted uh at
[00:13:11] level six unless you are at the highest
[00:13:13] levels of Education or your profession
[00:13:16] most people in their daily lives will be
[00:13:19] at the top of their game just being able
[00:13:22] to perform at level five consistently
[00:13:25] but just for your knowledge here are
[00:13:26] some examples of level six and as you
[00:13:28] can see it's pretty Advanced you can
[00:13:30] pause to read this a little bit more if
[00:13:31] you like or you can jump onto your AI
[00:13:32] and do this for your own subject now
[00:13:34] here's the part that is going to blow
[00:13:35] your mind if you want to get to level
[00:13:38] five and level six there are actually
[00:13:41] two different methods to get there the
[00:13:44] first way is to start studying and just
[00:13:46] to go through each level from bottom to
[00:13:49] top first you remember it and then you
[00:13:51] understand it and then you apply it and
[00:13:52] then you analyze it so on and so forth
[00:13:54] this sounds very logical but for most
[00:13:58] people this will not work the problem
[00:14:00] with starting at the bottom mastering
[00:14:02] level one then mastering level two then
[00:14:04] mastering level three Etc is that it is
[00:14:06] very very time consuming and most people
[00:14:10] do not have enough time to even reach
[00:14:13] level five let alone Master it so in
[00:14:16] reality most people will just do a
[00:14:17] little bit of each level kind of back
[00:14:19] and forth like for example in lectures
[00:14:21] they might be doing little bit of level
[00:14:23] one and then a little bit of level two
[00:14:24] and then later when doing some quizzes
[00:14:26] they might be doing a bit of level two
[00:14:27] and a little bit of level three and just
[00:14:29] sort of moving back and forth if they do
[00:14:31] a more challenging question they'll be
[00:14:32] doing a little bit of level four and
[00:14:34] then level five and this doesn't really
[00:14:36] work very well because we will always
[00:14:40] forget things over time in research we
[00:14:42] call this phenomenon knowledge Decay it
[00:14:44] occurs because the memory has something
[00:14:47] called a forgetting curve so basically
[00:14:49] while you're doing level two and level
[00:14:52] three our knowledge of level one will
[00:14:55] slowly Decay away right we're going to
[00:14:58] forget it and so instead of being able
[00:15:00] to actually just move up the levels
[00:15:02] we're going to be spending most of our
[00:15:03] time just relearning the things that we
[00:15:05] continuously forget so instead here is
[00:15:08] the better way to reach the higher
[00:15:11] levels instead of starting at level one
[00:15:13] and moving up we're going to start at
[00:15:16] level five and actually move down
[00:15:19] remember level five because level six is
[00:15:20] not relevant for most people and the
[00:15:21] reason this works is because our brain
[00:15:24] actually processes information and forms
[00:15:26] memory more strongly at level five than
[00:15:30] it does at level one and when we set our
[00:15:32] sights at the top our brain will
[00:15:34] actually fill in and achieve the lower
[00:15:38] levels of results along the way as
[00:15:41] almost like a side effect and this
[00:15:42] doesn't work the other way around if we
[00:15:44] are trying to just learn so that we can
[00:15:47] regurgitate material our brain is not
[00:15:49] going to then be able to automatically
[00:15:52] compare or prioritize information but if
[00:15:54] we are trying to compare and prioritize
[00:15:57] then we will gain better memory so that
[00:16:00] we can if we need to regurgitate explain
[00:16:03] and solve problems now by the way the
[00:16:05] science on this gets a little bit
[00:16:06] complicated so if you want me to go
[00:16:08] deeper in on this then let me know in
[00:16:09] the comments like I said level five
[00:16:11] takes more mental effort but it pays off
[00:16:14] big time by forgetting less so this
[00:16:17] means when we start studying don't focus
[00:16:19] on trying to remember or understand
[00:16:22] Focus most of your attention on trying
[00:16:25] to evaluate which forces you to
[00:16:28] understand and analyze it in the first
[00:16:30] place now if you found this video useful

[00:16:33] summarized sent straight to your inbox
[00:16:35] then I've actually got a newslet where I

=== Should you become a doctor? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9Rnc0gcPZk

[00:00:00] would rather be sick not even take a
[00:00:01] fake Sicky I would rather legitimately
[00:00:04] be sick to stay at home than go to work
[00:00:06] and I'm getting paid to go to work so I
[00:00:08] started thinking about like well this is
[00:00:10] essentially my life and yes when I'm at
[00:00:12] work I'm thinking oh it's not too bad
[00:00:14] like oh it's okay like oh this coffee is
[00:00:15] quite nice you know I made it to the end
[00:00:17] of the ward round and I get to do a few
[00:00:19] things during that day that I find kind
[00:00:20] of meaningful and like me personally
[00:00:22] there wasn't anything in medicine that I
[00:00:24] personally like loved there were a lot
[00:00:25] of little things that I thought oh it's
[00:00:26] pretty cool and I liked it and there
[00:00:28] were little elements that I felt were
[00:00:30] quite fulfilling but as a whole I
[00:00:31] definitely wouldn't say that the job had
[00:00:33] anything in it that I felt like I really
[00:00:35] really loved often I felt the sense of
[00:00:37] obligation to myself to try and love
[00:00:39] something to justify the fact that I was
[00:00:41] doing it


=== Medical School vs Real Life Doctors ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icu2Z9EhgTA

[00:00:00] most medical schools they are teaching
[00:00:02] things at a disease basis you learn like
[00:00:04] one disease and the signs and symptoms
[00:00:06] and the investigations for one disease
[00:00:07] and you kind of progress through but in
[00:00:09] Ral practice you're very rarely actually
[00:00:11] looking at it from a disease first point
[00:00:13] of view It's usually the opposite way
[00:00:15] where there's multiple possible diseases
[00:00:17] that are being formed through the you
[00:00:18] know the clinical reasoning process and
[00:00:20] actually what you're doing is you're
[00:00:21] saying well here's a set of symptoms and
[00:00:23] signs that I found how can I make sense
[00:00:25] of this which is really the total
[00:00:27] reverse way that many students will
[00:00:29] study something thing so even something
[00:00:31] that seems on the surface like it should
[00:00:33] be memorized just as it is it should
[00:00:35] always be challenged


=== Why I cram all the time? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7KbiYsU01I

[00:00:00] so I cram all the time the only
[00:00:01] difference is I cram at the very
[00:00:02] beginning of the semester I get all my
[00:00:03] studying done when the first couple
[00:00:04] weeks and then I just chill out I work
[00:00:06] full-time while studying full-time I can
[00:00:08] afford to do that luxury because I'm
[00:00:10] able to cram in a way that is efficient
[00:00:12] and the results that I get are the
[00:00:13] highest you can possibly get in the
[00:00:14] morning I do like the main important
[00:00:15] ones in the afternoon and do the next
[00:00:17] most important one it's more relevant
[00:00:19] from your brain's point of view and so
[00:00:20] it's going to hold on to it more so
[00:00:21] you're going to actually retain a
[00:00:22] greater percentage of what you study as
[00:00:23] well


=== 7 Years of Building a Learning System in 12 minutes ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GTt10GDWII

[00:00:00] I spent 7 years building a learning
[00:00:03] system that boosted my efficiency by
[00:00:05] over 60% and saved me at least 10 hours
[00:00:08] of studying per week and although every
[00:00:10] learner's brain is different the best
[00:00:13] thing about this system is that anyone
[00:00:15] can use it and personalize it and I call
[00:00:17] it the pero system it stands for priming
[00:00:20] encoding reference retrieval and
[00:00:23] overlearning I'll explain all of it in a
[00:00:24] sec one of the most common questions
[00:00:26] that people ask me is Justin what is the
[00:00:28] best technique for studying and if
[00:00:30] someone ask me this I immediately know
[00:00:33] something crucial about this person's
[00:00:35] studying ability it is that this person
[00:00:37] does not know how learning truly works
[00:00:40] because they thinking about techniques
[00:00:43] rather than systems and unless that
[00:00:45] changes you can never really be an
[00:00:47] efficient learner most people think of
[00:00:49] learning like this this is how I used to
[00:00:51] look at it information comes in we then
[00:00:54] do something that allows us to learn it
[00:00:58] and we enter through this cycle of
[00:01:00] repetition to strengthen our memory but
[00:01:02] this is just not how Learning Works
[00:01:05] learning is not just something that
[00:01:07] happens it is an entire series of
[00:01:09] processes and the quality of those
[00:01:11] processes affects how good your memory
[00:01:13] and your depth of understanding is going
[00:01:14] to be if the processes involved in this
[00:01:16] learning step are bad it means we have
[00:01:18] to have more repetition to make up for
[00:01:20] it on the other hand if our processes
[00:01:22] here are good that means that we need
[00:01:24] less repetition so instead the right way
[00:01:26] to think about learning is a little bit
[00:01:27] more like this information comes into
[00:01:29] our brain and then that information is
[00:01:32] filtered out it's filtered based on
[00:01:34] whether we think it is relevant to what
[00:01:36] we already know and that's based on what
[00:01:38] we already have existing in our memory
[00:01:40] so if it's related and if we can see how
[00:01:43] it is something that we need to hold on
[00:01:45] to we will then go and process it a
[00:01:48] little bit more organizing the
[00:01:50] information making sense of it and this
[00:01:52] is really where the understanding and
[00:01:54] the depth comes from once we do the
[00:01:57] processing part of that also helps to
[00:01:59] organ the information into our memory in
[00:02:02] a structure and a model that makes sense
[00:02:05] for us that is easy for our memory to
[00:02:07] hold on to and is relevant for our brain
[00:02:09] if it didn't meet that filtration
[00:02:11] criteria we are just going to forget it
[00:02:13] which means if information comes in and
[00:02:16] we think it's not relevant we don't see
[00:02:17] how it connects to anything else we
[00:02:19] don't see how it connects to anything we
[00:02:20] already know then no matter how many
[00:02:22] times you try to put the information in
[00:02:24] we are just going to forget it and
[00:02:26] usually very quickly on the other hand
[00:02:27] once the information is in our memory we
[00:02:29] can retrieve that knowledge and the
[00:02:32] retrieval process also helps to process
[00:02:34] and organize it again in a way that
[00:02:36] makes even more sense so this is
[00:02:37] constantly refining our memory within
[00:02:40] using our existing knowledge and our
[00:02:42] existing memory to help us filter any
[00:02:45] new information that comes in now
[00:02:47] learning is a lot more complicated than
[00:02:48] this by the way but if we use this model
[00:02:50] then we can start seeing where our own
[00:02:52] weaknesses might be so for example let's
[00:02:55] take me back when I was trying to enter
[00:02:57] into medical school studying 20 hours a
[00:02:59] day because I sucked at learning uh what
[00:03:01] I was doing I would just sit there and I
[00:03:03] just read through my notes I'd go to
[00:03:04] these lectures and sit there listening
[00:03:06] trying to understand whatever I could
[00:03:07] and then I'd spend all the rest of the
[00:03:08] day just writing more notes studying
[00:03:10] things again and then eventually doing
[00:03:12] flash cards on past papers that was like
[00:03:13] my entire life so for me if we look at
[00:03:15] this information was definitely coming
[00:03:17] in and very very quickly but I wasn't
[00:03:19] aware that my brain was filtering it
[00:03:21] based on relevance so I wasn't trying to
[00:03:24] make it more relevant as a result a lot
[00:03:26] of what I learned felt pretty random and
[00:03:28] arbitrary and I would for get a lot of
[00:03:30] it and so I'd have to shove it back in
[00:03:32] again so I was trapped inside this Loop
[00:03:34] and even though occasionally bits of it
[00:03:36] did make its way in so I was able to
[00:03:38] process it a little bit more eventually
[00:03:40] again it would end up being forgotten
[00:03:42] because of the fact that it still wasn't
[00:03:44] that relevant for my brain and I just
[00:03:46] wasn't aware that this is the process I
[00:03:48] need to try to optimize and once I
[00:03:50] nailed that that is what made the big
[00:03:53] difference for me that is what flipped
[00:03:54] my learning into a mode that was much
[00:03:56] more efficient and so this is where the
[00:03:58] Paro system comes in the p in pero
[00:04:01] stands for priming priming is any
[00:04:03] technique that you use before a main
[00:04:06] learning event that could be a class it
[00:04:08] could be a lecture it could just be a
[00:04:10] single long study session but it's
[00:04:12] talking about an activity that you do
[00:04:15] before you encounter a topic for the
[00:04:18] first time it is priming your brain to
[00:04:21] learn that information more effectively
[00:04:23] essentially what it's helping us do is
[00:04:25] it's helping our brain filter the
[00:04:27] information and say hey this new
[00:04:29] information is relevant let's move it
[00:04:31] along into the processing primming is
[00:04:34] one of the most effective things that
[00:04:36] you can Implement into a learning system
[00:04:38] because it's so early on in this
[00:04:40] learning flow and if you don't get this
[00:04:42] part right everything after this starts
[00:04:45] suffering you will get easily overloaded
[00:04:47] and overwhelmed you will find that your
[00:04:49] memory is very leaky you will find that
[00:04:50] you're not able to use and retrieve that
[00:04:52] knowledge very effectively because the
[00:04:54] information was not primed you would
[00:04:56] thrown a ball and you were not ready to
[00:04:58] catch it the e stands for encoding and
[00:05:00] in this diagram it stands for this
[00:05:02] processing part here it's talking about
[00:05:04] the part of learning that allows your
[00:05:06] brain to make sense of the information
[00:05:07] and then put it into your memory but
[00:05:09] encoding in the learning system means
[00:05:11] that you have to have techniques that
[00:05:12] allow your brain to organize and process
[00:05:15] the information effectively that means
[00:05:17] grouping things together simplifying
[00:05:20] things looking for analogies finding
[00:05:22] connections and relationships uh looking
[00:05:25] for ways to make the information more
[00:05:27] intuitive simpler easier to understand
[00:05:30] this is also the part that most people
[00:05:31] struggle with because it requires a lot
[00:05:33] of mental effort and thinking to do this
[00:05:35] which actually puts some people off but
[00:05:37] that is the active part of active
[00:05:39] learning when you don't do the encoding
[00:05:40] part correctly even though the
[00:05:42] information came in through the door
[00:05:44] it's not able to be moved into your
[00:05:45] memory very effectively and so even
[00:05:47] though you study a lot and a lot you
[00:05:49] will still continuously forget a large
[00:05:51] portion of what you spent your time
[00:05:52] learning now encoding is not a binary
[00:05:54] process it's not about whether you are
[00:05:56] doing it or not it's more of a spectrum
[00:05:58] and about creating efficiency in your
[00:06:00] processes so that you're moving
[00:06:02] information into your memory as quickly
[00:06:03] as possible the first R Imperial stands
[00:06:06] for reference and this is actually just
[00:06:08] about note taking it's not really on
[00:06:09] this pathway but it's about
[00:06:11] understanding that if you're trying to
[00:06:12] consume all the information all at once
[00:06:15] and you're trying to do all of the
[00:06:16] processing all at once you're going to
[00:06:18] get overloaded very quickly if you let
[00:06:19] yourself get bogged down in details that
[00:06:23] don't help you to organize the
[00:06:25] information in a way you want your brain
[00:06:27] power to be focused on moving the
[00:06:29] information
[00:06:30] through here into your memory and there
[00:06:32] are certain things that are going to be
[00:06:34] so specific and so fine and so detailed
[00:06:37] that it's not going to help do that it's
[00:06:39] just a distraction and that's where
[00:06:41] referencing comes in which is taking
[00:06:43] those pieces of information and just
[00:06:44] putting them somewhere else so that you
[00:06:47] can come back to it later this could be
[00:06:49] in the form of flash cards a sick and
[00:06:50] brain app using something like obsidian
[00:06:52] whatever you want to do it's a parking
[00:06:54] lot a dump for all the very very fine
[00:06:57] details that you don't want to B with
[00:07:00] while you are encoding and processing
[00:07:02] the second R is retrieval and retrieval
[00:07:05] is the part where you're taking
[00:07:07] information from your memory and then
[00:07:08] you are testing yourself and challenging
[00:07:10] your ability to use and apply that
[00:07:12] knowledge retrieval is a necessary
[00:07:15] component of every Learning System
[00:07:17] number one because that's what actually
[00:07:19] tests your ability to use your knowledge
[00:07:21] but number two because the act of
[00:07:23] retrieving knowledge actually helps you
[00:07:25] to reprocess and repackage that
[00:07:27] knowledge which strengthens your memory
[00:07:29] and deepens your understanding which is
[00:07:31] where I imperio comes in which stands
[00:07:33] for interleaving interleaving is hitting
[00:07:35] a topic from multiple perspectives and
[00:07:37] multiple angles I've actually got
[00:07:39] another video about interleaving here
[00:07:41] cuz it's a big topic and actually one of
[00:07:43] the most important things that you can
[00:07:44] do to upgrade your Learning System but
[00:07:46] in summary it's about making sure that
[00:07:47] you are testing yourself in multiple
[00:07:50] perspectives rather than just the one
[00:07:52] way you learned it and just testing
[00:07:54] yourself in that one way when you don't
[00:07:55] do interleaving your knowledge becomes
[00:07:57] very narrow which means yes you may be
[00:07:59] able to answer questions if they are
[00:08:01] asked in the same way that your flash
[00:08:03] card has it written down but if there's
[00:08:05] a curveball question if there's a
[00:08:06] combination of Concepts that you never
[00:08:08] really thought about before or it's just
[00:08:10] something that feels a little bit out of
[00:08:11] scope you're going to struggle usually
[00:08:14] these are the questions that separate
[00:08:15] the top Learners from the rest and the
[00:08:16] final o imperio is for overlearning
[00:08:19] overlearning is when you're learning
[00:08:21] more than you need to a little bit more
[00:08:22] out of scope and a little bit deeper
[00:08:25] into a higher standard it often involves
[00:08:27] a lot of repetition for example doing
[00:08:29] lots of practice questions or lots of
[00:08:31] flash cards or just going over things
[00:08:34] again and again this is the part of
[00:08:36] learning that is repetitive by Nature
[00:08:39] it's what creates that faster recall and
[00:08:41] that enhanced fluency with your
[00:08:44] knowledge it is also optional a lot of
[00:08:47] people don't need to do overlearning
[00:08:48] because overlearning is really only
[00:08:50] effective once you're sitting really
[00:08:52] competitive assessments or where the
[00:08:54] standard for excellence is very very
[00:08:56] high most people and most day-to-day
[00:08:58] studying don't need to have over
[00:08:59] learning at all unfortunately most
[00:09:02] people also use overlearning strategies
[00:09:05] as their first strategy in the learning
[00:09:07] process and that takes time and
[00:09:09] attention away from doing the priming en
[00:09:12] coding and retrieval Parts properly it's
[00:09:14] basically this cycle that I talked about
[00:09:16] before where you're basically just
[00:09:17] compensating for ineffective encoding
[00:09:19] through lots of repetition so to help
[00:09:20] you evaluate your own Learning System
[00:09:22] I've actually gone ahead and created a
[00:09:24] quiz that you can go through and it will
[00:09:26] score your learning system based on each
[00:09:28] part of per
[00:09:29] it's free to do I'll check a link in the
[00:09:31] description below don't say I never do
[00:09:32] anything for you so I'm going to go
[00:09:33] ahead and answer these questions based
[00:09:35] on how I used to study and I'll see what
[00:09:37] the score
[00:09:49] says and
[00:09:51] 35% uh that's about what I expected uh
[00:09:56] it's pretty bad uh if you do this
[00:09:58] yourself you can see um you can scroll
[00:09:59] down and learn a little bit more about
[00:10:01] it yeah it looks pretty tragic for me
[00:10:03] they'll give you a bunch of
[00:10:05] recommendations based on your scores in
[00:10:07] terms of what you need to improve on and
[00:10:08] what priority so feel free to go through
[00:10:10] that yourself okay so I was going to end
[00:10:12] the video right there but I wanted to
[00:10:13] make sure that this quiz was helpful for
[00:10:15] as many people as possible so I actually
[00:10:17] went ahead and gave early access to a
[00:10:19] bunch of people to see how they found it
[00:10:20] and they had a diverse range of resorts
[00:10:22] some of them scored pretty average and
[00:10:23] some of them scored surprisingly well
[00:10:25] and after seeing the results I learned
[00:10:27] two things number one people who weren't
[00:10:30] very confident in how they learn also
[00:10:32] had lower scores and an explanation for
[00:10:35] why they were not so confident and
[00:10:36] number two everyone found the quiz
[00:10:38] helpful hello my name is Julian Nisha Ed
[00:10:42] and I've just taken I can studies
[00:10:44] Learning System Diagnostic and results
[00:10:46] were very helpful because previously
[00:10:48] I've never had something that would
[00:10:50] actually quantify and measure how
[00:10:53] effective my learning system was I
[00:10:55] definitely think that this is a tool
[00:10:57] that I could use in the classroom
[00:10:59] particularly for subjects where we're
[00:11:00] teaching kids how to learn at a really
[00:11:02] young age like your 9 year 10 I found
[00:11:04] the test uh pretty easy to use it's sort
[00:11:07] of good to pinpoint what exactly am I'm
[00:11:10] doing wrong so I did find it insightful
[00:11:12] in that regard and it's been so helpful
[00:11:15] just with like not just learning the
[00:11:17] content but actually understanding it
[00:11:19] and seeing the significance of like a
[00:11:22] learning approach I'm just super
[00:11:23] grateful that like I could give this a
[00:11:25] go I'm going to really try and
[00:11:27] incorporate some of the suggestions
[00:11:30] and see how they go so I'm super glad I
[00:11:33] do the quiz and I highly recommend it
[00:11:34] for you as well it's only a few minutes
[00:11:36] but the insights that you'll get from
[00:11:38] there will save you hours down the line
[00:11:40] so I'm really excited for you to give
[00:11:42] the quiz a go yourself the link is in
[00:11:43] the description make sure to check it
[00:11:45] out thank you so much for watching and
[00:11:46] I'll see you in the next one and yes by
[00:11:49] the way I am in a new office


=== How To Learn Any Skill So Fast It Feels Illegal ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSDprg24pEA

[00:00:00] I've been obsessed with figuring out the
[00:00:02] fastest and easiest possible way to
[00:00:05] learn new skills for the last decade and
[00:00:08] after years of teaching people and
[00:00:10] reading the research on this I've
[00:00:12] stumbled across a mistake that
[00:00:16] guarantees an almost 100% failure rate
[00:00:20] on learning any skill and sadly this is
[00:00:22] a mistake that most people make every
[00:00:25] single day I call this mistake Theory
[00:00:28] overload and I think it is one of the
[00:00:30] most important things to know about when
[00:00:33] you're trying to learn any new skill but
[00:00:35] first we have to understand a key often
[00:00:37] overlooked ingredient to learning any
[00:00:40] new skill that allows us to even learn
[00:00:44] skills in the first place and this
[00:00:47] ingredient is experiential cycling so if
[00:00:50] I practice shooting this bow every day
[00:00:54] for a month I should get
[00:00:57] bitter right
[00:01:00] [Music]
[00:01:01] maybe but maybe not once I let go of
[00:01:05] this Arrow I cannot control where it
[00:01:08] goes midair at least as far as I know
[00:01:12] where this Arrow lands depends on
[00:01:15] everything that I did in the setup
[00:01:18] beforehand and by the way like any skill
[00:01:20] learning to learn is the same our exam
[00:01:23] results our memory our depth of
[00:01:24] understanding these things depend on the
[00:01:26] processes we used before when we were
[00:01:29] studying now imag imagine I shot this
[00:01:31] arrow and it
[00:01:33] landed here not very good but to do
[00:01:36] better next time I have to know what to
[00:01:39] change to get it into the center I
[00:01:42] cannot keep just firing arrows off
[00:01:45] randomly expecting to get better I might
[00:01:48] get a bullseye once in a while but it's
[00:01:49] not going to be consistent and once the
[00:01:51] target moves further away it's not going
[00:01:52] to work anymore same thing in learning
[00:01:54] if we get a bad exam result we need to
[00:01:56] know what to change and just because we
[00:01:58] get a better exam result in a different
[00:02:00] exam it doesn't mean we actually solved
[00:02:02] the problem so this is essentially the
[00:02:05] experiential cycle we have an experience
[00:02:09] we observe the result we think about
[00:02:12] what we need to change and then we do an
[00:02:14] experiment to see if it made it any
[00:02:16] better without this cycle we cannot
[00:02:20] learn any new skill this is pretty
[00:02:23] straight forward and obvious but here's
[00:02:26] the part that traps people whether it's
[00:02:29] learning about learning skills or
[00:02:30] learning to shoot an arrow or learning
[00:02:32] any other skill the fastest way to learn
[00:02:38] any skill is to learn more slowly this
[00:02:44] is the theory overload trap now most of
[00:02:48] you know that I've got a program that
[00:02:49] teaches people to learn more efficiently
[00:02:51] and one of the things that I can do on
[00:02:52] the program that I can't do on YouTube
[00:02:54] is I get to observe how the students
[00:02:57] behave and I can track their progress
[00:03:00] much more closely so take a look at
[00:03:02] these two students and see if you can
[00:03:04] guess which one ended up being more
[00:03:06] academically successful first one to
[00:03:08] look at is this one here sures who was
[00:03:12] on the program for 5 weeks and got
[00:03:14] through
[00:03:16] 31% of the program and the second
[00:03:20] student that I want you to look at is
[00:03:22] Enzo who was on the program for 54 weeks
[00:03:27] and got through 20%
[00:03:30] of the program who do you think improved
[00:03:32] the fastest so despite covering less of
[00:03:36] the course it was actually Enzo who
[00:03:39] ended up with better academic results he
[00:03:43] went from a baseline of
[00:03:45] 62% to latest exam result of
[00:03:49] 92% compared to sish and this is the
[00:03:52] surprising part sish actually went from
[00:03:56] 80% to
[00:03:58] 71% s actually got worse after working
[00:04:02] on it for 5 weeks why did sesh get worse
[00:04:06] I'll give you a clue it's not just
[00:04:09] because Enzo had so much more time to
[00:04:12] work on things well the answer is Theory
[00:04:16] overload okay now imagine this bowl is
[00:04:19] your
[00:04:21] brain very smooth just kidding now your
[00:04:24] brain has a limited amount of cognitive
[00:04:28] resources that it can can spend it's
[00:04:30] like how much memory or Ram your
[00:04:33] computer has so let's say that these
[00:04:35] wooden blocks represent your cognitive
[00:04:38] resources now whenever we learn a new
[00:04:40] skill we're introduced to new things
[00:04:43] that we need to think about so each
[00:04:47] thing takes resources to keep it in mind
[00:04:50] and think about it hold my arrow more
[00:04:53] tightly stabilize my core keep my
[00:04:57] shoulders uh relaxed bre breathe more
[00:05:01] slowly aim a little bit lower you can
[00:05:03] see that my bowl my capacity is becoming
[00:05:08] filled up and on top of that there's a
[00:05:09] certain amount of resources it takes to
[00:05:12] just perform the activity now once a new
[00:05:15] skill eventually becomes a habit the
[00:05:18] amount of resources it takes goes down
[00:05:21] but when you're learning a new skill
[00:05:22] it's not going to be a habit it's going
[00:05:24] to be unfamiliar and difficult and
[00:05:26] awkward and all of those things take
[00:05:29] additional resources to overcome so more
[00:05:33] and more needs to be invested into just
[00:05:35] doing the actual skill and as you can
[00:05:38] see now we
[00:05:40] are overflowing we've overloaded our
[00:05:43] brain's ability to think about things
[00:05:46] because we have given it too many things
[00:05:49] to think about in the research our brain
[00:05:52] trying to think about lots of different
[00:05:53] things at the same time is called
[00:05:55] multiple element interactivity and it's
[00:05:57] a common reason why we enter into what's
[00:05:59] called cognitive overload but here is
[00:06:02] the thing about learning a cognitive
[00:06:03] skill like learning to learn for example
[00:06:06] unlike learning a physical skill like
[00:06:09] archery for a physical skill we burn
[00:06:12] energy using our body using our muscles
[00:06:15] for a cognitive skill we burn effort
[00:06:19] with our brain which means that the
[00:06:22] amount of cognitive resources it takes
[00:06:26] to just perform the skill the act of
[00:06:30] learning is innately very high to begin
[00:06:35] with it takes a lot of mental resources
[00:06:38] to understand new information and
[00:06:40] process it and organize it and think
[00:06:42] about where it belongs and create new
[00:06:45] memory and all of this effort helps to
[00:06:48] translate the learning into memory and
[00:06:52] understanding if we didn't feel this
[00:06:53] effort we wouldn't have any memory and
[00:06:55] that would be called passive learning
[00:06:58] but with effective more active learning
[00:07:00] it takes a lot of resources to begin
[00:07:03] with which means adding just a few more
[00:07:08] things can put us into
[00:07:10] overload very quickly so in that case
[00:07:15] what is the best way to learn a new
[00:07:19] skill especially a cognitive skill well
[00:07:22] at the end of the day all of that means
[00:07:24] that when we're learning a new skill we
[00:07:27] should only ever be trying to experient
[00:07:29] expent with one or two things at the
[00:07:32] same time so sesh who covered like 30%
[00:07:36] of the program in a month would have
[00:07:38] learned over a dozen new techniques and
[00:07:40] each technique has two or three things
[00:07:42] to think about so that means that SES
[00:07:45] would have been trying to juggle 20 or
[00:07:48] 30 things at any given time he was
[00:07:51] completely overloaded and therefore his
[00:07:54] brain was not able to actually learn the
[00:07:57] skills and this is exactly why some
[00:07:59] students
[00:08:00] if they don't realize this trap can
[00:08:02] spend months or even years trying to
[00:08:06] learn a new skill and feeling like it is
[00:08:11] impossible to get it right because no
[00:08:13] matter how much time they put into it
[00:08:15] they do not seem to be improving it is
[00:08:17] incredibly frustrating so here's the
[00:08:19] secret to learning any skill the right
[00:08:23] way always balance your new Theory with
[00:08:27] practice if you practice ice without any
[00:08:30] Theory it's aimless if you practice with
[00:08:33] too much Theory you're getting
[00:08:35] overloaded so the trick is to balance
[00:08:38] new Theory coming in with your existing
[00:08:42] skills becoming Habits Like I mentioned
[00:08:45] before when skills become habits your
[00:08:48] brain figures out a more efficient way
[00:08:51] to do it it doesn't require so many
[00:08:54] cognitive resources anymore it finds a
[00:08:57] shortcut and so
[00:09:00] the amount of cognitive resources it
[00:09:02] takes to perform the skill goes down as
[00:09:05] more of this new skill just starts to
[00:09:09] become an old habit and eventually what
[00:09:12] took a lot of concentration to do now
[00:09:14] takes virtually no thinking at all and
[00:09:18] you can still do it just as accurately
[00:09:20] and just as consistently we have freed
[00:09:22] up more cognitive resources to take in
[00:09:25] some new
[00:09:27] Theory and turn those into habits for
[00:09:30] some skills and techniques it can take
[00:09:32] weeks if not months to develop them into
[00:09:35] habits whereas for some it can just take
[00:09:37] a few hours and by balancing the theory
[00:09:40] with practice we can achieve Optimum
[00:09:43] skill growth where we are practicing and
[00:09:46] every time we practice we are improving
[00:09:49] with focus and Direction but we're not
[00:09:52] getting overloaded so here's what this
[00:09:54] looks like in practice let's say we've
[00:09:56] only got 5 hours a week to
[00:09:59] practice now that is not probably enough
[00:10:02] to form new habits very quickly and so
[00:10:05] we're going to need to reduce the amount
[00:10:07] of new Theory we take in and because
[00:10:11] we've got a low amount of practice and
[00:10:14] therefore a low amount of theory the two
[00:10:16] of them are aligned and we can achieve
[00:10:18] our Optimum skill growth now let's say
[00:10:21] we now have a little bit more free time
[00:10:23] and we want to dedicate a little bit
[00:10:24] more time to learning this skill so we
[00:10:26] have now 20 hours a week that we can
[00:10:29] dedicate to practice so the amount that
[00:10:32] we can practice has now gone
[00:10:35] up which means we can also go up in the
[00:10:38] amount of theory we can take
[00:10:40] in but it's proportional to the amount
[00:10:44] of extra practice we're getting so as a
[00:10:46] rule of thumb I usually say for every
[00:10:49] hour of theory we should have at least 5
[00:10:52] hours of practice so for example if we
[00:10:55] have 5 hours of practice we would only
[00:10:57] be able to take in 1 hour of theory in
[00:11:00] this first example whereas in the second
[00:11:02] example we've got 20 hours of practice
[00:11:04] therefore we can have up to 4 hours of
[00:11:07] theory now unfortunately that's just a
[00:11:10] rule of thumb and in reality it's a
[00:11:12] little bit more complicated because 5
[00:11:15] hours of practicing a very complicated
[00:11:17] skill is not the same as 5 hours of
[00:11:21] practicing a very simple skill like a
[00:11:22] new way to tie your shoelaces in which
[00:11:24] case 5 hours of practice is probably
[00:11:27] Overkill and so what's more important
[00:11:29] and accurate than just the number of
[00:11:31] hours of practice is actually monitoring
[00:11:35] how quickly we're able to form new
[00:11:37] habits when new habits form we have the
[00:11:40] mental space to take in more Theory so
[00:11:44] if we're very slow at forming new habits
[00:11:47] then we're going to be slower at taking
[00:11:50] in new Theory and the way you can know
[00:11:52] that new habits are forming is when you
[00:11:55] can feel that things are becoming easier
[00:11:58] and faster
[00:12:00] without compromising your accuracy and
[00:12:03] your consistency and most of the time
[00:12:06] you're able to get faster without trying
[00:12:09] to get faster the speed comes with the
[00:12:12] efficiency that your brain develops at
[00:12:15] just getting better at doing it now this
[00:12:17] is where I have to give props to Enzo
[00:12:19] because Enzo realized that he was
[00:12:21] developing new habits more slowly than
[00:12:25] we would have anticipated and so he took
[00:12:29] a year to cover 20% of the program so
[00:12:32] instead of 5 hours of practice for every
[00:12:35] hour of theory he was doing more like 15
[00:12:38] 20 hours of practice for every hour of
[00:12:41] theory so even though on the surface it
[00:12:43] looked like he was going very slowly his
[00:12:47] skill growth was being maintained at an
[00:12:50] optimal rate because he was never
[00:12:52] letting himself get overloaded and by
[00:12:55] the way if you're interested in the
[00:12:56] program yourself there's a link in the
[00:12:58] description that you check out now while
[00:13:00] Theory overload has an almost 100%
[00:13:03] failure rate the reverse is also true
[00:13:07] Almost 100% of the time I see someone
[00:13:10] balancing their Theory intake rate with
[00:13:14] their practice and habit forming rate
[00:13:18] they are able to learn their desired
[00:13:20] skill very smoothly and very quickly
[00:13:24] which is why I said that I think this is
[00:13:26] one of the most important things to
[00:13:28] understand if you want to learn any
[00:13:30] skill I hope that helps and if you've
[00:13:32] got the capacity for just one more bit
[00:13:35] of theory then check out this video that
[00:13:37] YouTube thinks you'll like thanks for
[00:13:40] watching and I'll see you next time


=== How to Force Your Brain to Study (when you don't feel like it) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6ks5OCQR9I

[00:00:00] there is a method of learning that I've
[00:00:02] been using for years to force my brain
[00:00:05] to study even when I don't feel like it
[00:00:08] especially on days where I am feeling
[00:00:10] tired and burnt out it's called the
[00:00:12] ladder method I use this method to study
[00:00:16] learning science while working as a
[00:00:19] doctor full-time while running a
[00:00:21] business I also use this for my
[00:00:23] full-time Masters again while I was
[00:00:24] working full-time and I managed to
[00:00:26] graduate at the top of my cohort it's
[00:00:28] probably one of the most used useful
[00:00:30] techniques that I use on a daily basis
[00:00:32] anyone can use including you and I show
[00:00:35] you how it works on something like this
[00:00:37] beefy textbook but first we have to
[00:00:41] understand why we don't feel like
[00:00:44] learning in the first place and once you
[00:00:47] understand that the ladder method will
[00:00:48] make a lot of sense now there's a reason
[00:00:51] that we don't feel overwhelmed at the
[00:00:53] thought of tying our shoelaces or
[00:00:55] walking 20 steps but we might get
[00:00:58] overwhelmed at the thought of climing an
[00:01:00] entire Mountain even though walking a
[00:01:03] few steps and tying your shoes are the
[00:01:05] first steps of climbing a mountain
[00:01:07] what's happening is that our brain is
[00:01:09] making a judgment on how hard something
[00:01:11] is going to be and how much effort and
[00:01:13] energy it's going to require our brain
[00:01:16] uses a lot of energy it's the most
[00:01:18] energy consuming organ in our body
[00:01:20] consuming 20% of our resting energy so
[00:01:23] it is incredibly efficient at avoiding
[00:01:26] unnecessary energy intake now when it
[00:01:29] comes to study in one of the most energy
[00:01:31] consuming things that your brain has to
[00:01:33] do and therefore doesn't want to do is
[00:01:36] to organize information it's a crucial
[00:01:40] part of forming memory and developing
[00:01:41] understanding so here's how that works
[00:01:43] imagine these marbles represent new
[00:01:46] information each marble is a fact or
[00:01:49] concept that you need to learn and these
[00:01:51] cups represent how your brain is trying
[00:01:54] to organize it whenever you learn
[00:01:57] something new your brain has to look at
[00:01:59] it
[00:02:00] understand it analyze it and make a
[00:02:02] decision about which cup it belongs in
[00:02:05] it looks at how similar it is to what is
[00:02:08] already inside these cups and it groups
[00:02:11] this information based on similarities
[00:02:14] and all of this thinking takes energy
[00:02:17] and we feel that as mental effort our
[00:02:20] brain is working and once it figures out
[00:02:23] where it belongs and then it organizes
[00:02:26] it then the mental effort goes down cuz
[00:02:29] it's stored away and this process
[00:02:31] repeats with the next piece of
[00:02:33] information it looks at makes a decision
[00:02:36] and then decides where we want to store
[00:02:38] it and then we repeat this process until
[00:02:40] our learning
[00:02:48] is
[00:02:49] complete so then what part of this makes
[00:02:53] our brain feel overwhelmed so that we
[00:02:55] don't feel like studying well imagine if
[00:02:57] I didn't have any cups at all
[00:03:00] now instead of picking up a piece of
[00:03:03] information looking at it and asking
[00:03:05] ourselves which Cup Does It Go in we
[00:03:08] have to ask ourselves how many cups do I
[00:03:11] need which cup should I get what are the
[00:03:14] alternative options what else do I need
[00:03:16] to put into this hypothetical cup and
[00:03:19] then what am I meant to do if uh a few
[00:03:21] more pieces of information later I
[00:03:23] realize that that was wrong after all I
[00:03:26] don't know what other options there are
[00:03:28] because I've only got this one piece of
[00:03:30] information to work with and trying to
[00:03:33] figure out all of that takes much more
[00:03:37] effort and energy which creates the I
[00:03:40] don't want to study feeling so there are
[00:03:42] three main ways that your brain uses
[00:03:45] lots of energy while learning first is
[00:03:48] to just understand what it is consuming
[00:03:50] reading listening to the second is to
[00:03:53] compare it with what you already know
[00:03:57] and then the third is to decide where
[00:04:00] it's going to put that information where
[00:04:02] does it belong based on how similar it
[00:04:05] is or how related it is to the things
[00:04:07] that you just compared it to and trying
[00:04:09] to do all three of these things at once
[00:04:13] while you're learning creates overwhelm
[00:04:16] and is going to be very daunting so what
[00:04:18] do we do instead so let's say that I
[00:04:20] want to study this chapter in this
[00:04:22] textbook immediately I look through this
[00:04:26] and I feel like man there's a lot to
[00:04:28] cover I feel like this going going to
[00:04:29] require a lot of work I'm getting
[00:04:31] overwhelmed and now I don't want to
[00:04:33] study this is where the ladder method
[00:04:35] comes in based on the ladder method we
[00:04:36] are going to be breaking up this topic
[00:04:39] this chapter based on different rungs of
[00:04:42] effort and each rung on the ladder is
[00:04:46] low effort so let me show you this
[00:04:48] here's what I'm doing during this I'm
[00:04:50] going through the textbook and I'm
[00:04:51] looking for the things that are low
[00:04:54] effort I'm saying what are the things
[00:04:56] that feel easy for me to understand that
[00:04:58] I can easy compare with the things that
[00:05:01] I already know and that I can easily
[00:05:05] think about and how the topic might be
[00:05:07] organized I'm also using some nonlinear
[00:05:09] note taking to track my thoughts which I
[00:05:12] talk about in some other videos I'm also
[00:05:14] highlighting the parts that I actually
[00:05:16] focused on just for you to be able to
[00:05:17] see at the end of this I wouldn't
[00:05:19] normally highlight anything when I'm
[00:05:21] doing this just a nonlinear notes is
[00:05:22] fine you'll be able to see that but I'm
[00:05:24] just trying to show you what I am
[00:05:26] focusing on and what I am either skim
[00:05:28] reading or just compl completely
[00:05:30] skipping because I think it would take
[00:05:32] too much effort to try to understand or
[00:05:35] compare or to organize by the way don't
[00:05:37] worry this is an old ass textbook uh
[00:05:40] with highlighting all over the place
[00:05:42] already uh I'm not ruining a new book
[00:05:44] okay so as you can see I have skipped
[00:05:48] basically you know like most things if
[00:05:50] you look at the parts that are
[00:05:51] highlighted most of it has been skipped
[00:05:55] you know it's pretty bare however I have
[00:05:58] managed to with just the parts that I
[00:06:00] focused on build a pretty decent
[00:06:04] scaffold for me to work off of and so
[00:06:06] this topic has become a little bit
[00:06:08] easier for me now than it would have
[00:06:10] been 10 15 minutes ago so if I'm really
[00:06:13] tired I can call that a day I can end on
[00:06:16] that rung or the ladder and I can pick
[00:06:17] up the second rung another day or if I
[00:06:20] want to I can just do the second rung
[00:06:22] now and on the second rung I'm going to
[00:06:23] do exactly the same thing I'm going to
[00:06:25] look for the things that feel easier and
[00:06:28] feel lower effort I'm going to build on
[00:06:30] my scaffold and build up on my knowledge
[00:06:32] but the difference is that it's going to
[00:06:34] take a little bit longer each successive
[00:06:36] rung on the ladder takes a little bit
[00:06:38] longer because now more things make
[00:06:41] sense to us than they did before and
[00:06:43] we're probably ready to go into a little
[00:06:45] bit more detail having said that it is
[00:06:47] still low effort because now I've
[00:06:51] established some of those major cups I
[00:06:54] need to fill so let's now do the second
[00:06:57] rung
[00:07:01] [Music]
[00:07:24] [Music]
[00:07:40] all righty and that was about 35 minutes
[00:07:44] that I spent on that so you can see the
[00:07:46] second rung took a little longer I was
[00:07:47] able to get through more detail what was
[00:07:50] surprising in a way is that the second
[00:07:52] rung when I went through it there wasn't
[00:07:53] a lot more stuff that I felt like I was
[00:07:56] going through but it was more like I was
[00:07:58] just going through the same ideas but
[00:07:59] deeper and really figuring it out and
[00:08:02] you can see that a lot of the time was
[00:08:04] spent on just organizing the information
[00:08:06] so you can see of the ways that our
[00:08:07] brain can use energy before I was using
[00:08:10] a lot of that energy on just trying to
[00:08:12] understand things and put things
[00:08:14] together in a very general rough way
[00:08:16] again just figuring out maybe how many
[00:08:18] cups I need roughly and in the second
[00:08:21] rung I'm now refining that I'm spending
[00:08:23] more of their energy not on just
[00:08:25] understanding but now really on just
[00:08:27] making sure those decisions and those
[00:08:29] compar are correct so same amount of
[00:08:31] effort just used in a different way
[00:08:33] depending on the rung now the third time
[00:08:35] I go through it should be enough to
[00:08:37] cover off this topic I'd be going
[00:08:38] through a little bit more of those
[00:08:40] details either adding them to my map or
[00:08:41] adding them to flash cards depending on
[00:08:43] the type of information most topics I
[00:08:44] find you generally can get through all
[00:08:46] of it in just three rungs of the ladder
[00:08:49] and so here's the secret as to why this
[00:08:52] technique works so well it's because
[00:08:54] each rung takes the same effort as the
[00:08:58] last rung and I'm splitting all the work
[00:09:00] that I need to do for this topic into
[00:09:02] each rung it makes every study session
[00:09:05] easy cuz we're just not letting
[00:09:08] ourselves spend time on things that are
[00:09:10] hard but also it gets easier the more
[00:09:14] you do it even though with each rung
[00:09:16] we're covering more content and more
[00:09:19] detail it's easier to make sense of it
[00:09:22] because our cups and our structure and
[00:09:24] our foundations are so strong the more
[00:09:26] you learn the easier it gets you can
[00:09:29] also the same approach for projects or
[00:09:31] assignments as well where you start with
[00:09:33] the easy high level planning first and
[00:09:35] you progressively get more and more
[00:09:37] detailed with each rung of the ladder
[00:09:39] now this is just one type of way that
[00:09:42] you can use the ladder method and there
[00:09:44] are so many other applications of this
[00:09:46] principle that I teach in my full guided
[00:09:48] program but for someone who has never
[00:09:50] tried studying like this it is a
[00:09:52] complete Game Changer by the way if you
[00:09:54] are interested in my program you can
[00:09:56] check out the link in the description
[00:09:57] there's this technique and dozens of
[00:09:59] other techniques that you can learn once
[00:10:00] you start using this ladder method a
[00:10:02] couple of times your brain will realize
[00:10:05] hey studying isn't that bad and it will
[00:10:08] make you less likely to put things off
[00:10:10] and less likely to procrastinate and
[00:10:11] although this technique is amazing there
[00:10:14] is a lot more to learning than just the
[00:10:17] latter method so make sure to check out
[00:10:20] this video next which YouTube thinks you
[00:10:22] will like and as we all know the YouTube
[00:10:25] algorithm knows us better than we know
[00:10:28] ourselves anyway thanks for watching and
[00:10:31] I'll see you in the next one

[00:00:00] the best answer to what do you want to
[00:00:02] be when you grow up is I don't know yet
[00:00:05] but I'm figuring it out and that should
[00:00:06] be your answer for your whole 20s and
[00:00:09] arguably even through your 30s because
[00:00:11] here's the thing about deciding on
[00:00:14] careers you're probably going to be
[00:00:17] wrong and that's okay the majority of
[00:00:20] people on this planet would change their
[00:00:22] career three to 7 times in their life
[00:00:25] back when I was in high school I wanted
[00:00:27] to become a doctor and I did succeed I
[00:00:28] did become a doctor and I'd love loved
[00:00:30] it in a lot of ways but eventually I
[00:00:31] quit medicine and now I work in
[00:00:34] education and Entrepreneurship full-time
[00:00:36] and I will tell you I do not regret
[00:00:39] leaving medicine and there are some very
[00:00:42] good reasons why you too should not be
[00:00:46] too fixed on a career one of the fields
[00:00:48] I've been involved in researching and
[00:00:50] Publishing on is called employability it
[00:00:52] studies how people go through education
[00:00:54] and then get jobs and then navigate
[00:00:56] those jobs in a way that makes them feel
[00:00:58] fulfilled and there's this handy term
[00:01:00] thrown around in employability research
[00:01:02] that's useful for you to think about the
[00:01:03] term is employability trajectories and
[00:01:07] we use the word employability trajectory
[00:01:10] instead of career path because what
[00:01:13] research has shown is that careers are
[00:01:15] rarely paths to take like a railroad
[00:01:18] that a train rolls down at least not in
[00:01:21] the Modern Age instead the path you take
[00:01:24] is more like a car driving in a desert
[00:01:26] you can go anywhere and the path is what
[00:01:29] you see when you look behind behind you
[00:01:30] and look at the trail you left behind we
[00:01:32] say trajectory because where you end up
[00:01:35] depends on what you are doing now but it
[00:01:39] can change let me tell you a secret that
[00:01:42] my teachers and my career counselors
[00:01:44] never told me knowing what you want to
[00:01:47] do early in life is not a good thing so
[00:01:51] I used to run this nonprofit helping
[00:01:53] students enter into Healthcare Pathways
[00:01:55] and I'd run this seminar and I'd ask a
[00:01:57] question how many of you want to be a
[00:01:59] doctor and everyone puts their hands up
[00:02:01] then I say well how many of you really
[00:02:04] want to be a doctor like really
[00:02:06] committed and willing to put in the work
[00:02:08] and everyone keeps their hands up so I
[00:02:10] say how many of you have wanted this for
[00:02:12] as long as you can remember you've
[00:02:14] wanted it since you were like 9 years
[00:02:15] old and at this point their hands are
[00:02:17] still up people are grinning you can see
[00:02:19] that they're like proud that they're you
[00:02:21] know able to Showcase how committed and
[00:02:23] determined they are and that is a
[00:02:25] problem because we should not be
[00:02:27] deciding on what we want to do for the
[00:02:29] rest of Our Lives based on a decision
[00:02:32] made by a
[00:02:34] 9-year-old even if that 9-year-old was
[00:02:37] ourself in fact it's mathematically a
[00:02:40] better decision for you to change
[00:02:41] careers as you get older because of a
[00:02:44] phenomenon called probability
[00:02:46] concentration there's this famous
[00:02:47] mathematics question called the Monty
[00:02:49] Hall problem so there's this game show
[00:02:52] called The Monty Hall show or something
[00:02:54] and there are three doors and behind one
[00:02:56] of the doors is a dream car and behind
[00:02:58] two of The Doors was is a goat and in
[00:03:02] this example we're assuming that we want
[00:03:04] a dream car even though goats are pretty
[00:03:05] awesome the participant chooses a door
[00:03:08] and the game show host who knows what's
[00:03:10] behind the doors will open one of the
[00:03:14] doors that does not have the dream car
[00:03:16] behind it it's Scott the goat and then
[00:03:19] they ask the question do you want to
[00:03:22] stick with your first decision or do you
[00:03:26] want to switch to a different door now
[00:03:28] at this point there's only two doors
[00:03:30] left that remain closed do you switch or
[00:03:34] do you stay now the trippy part about
[00:03:37] this is that it seems intuitively that
[00:03:39] there's a 50% chance so it shouldn't
[00:03:41] really matter but actually
[00:03:43] mathematically speaking you should
[00:03:45] change in fact there is a
[00:03:47] 66% chance that your dream car is behind
[00:03:51] another door the other door that you did
[00:03:53] not picked how does that work well this
[00:03:56] is what probability concentration is it
[00:03:58] is because the probability that your
[00:04:01] decision was correct is determined at
[00:04:04] the point you made the decision and even
[00:04:08] if you get more information later down
[00:04:10] the line it does not change the chances
[00:04:13] you were correct when you made the
[00:04:15] decision this is much more obvious when
[00:04:17] we think about something like this
[00:04:19] instead of three doors let's play a
[00:04:22] different game I'm thinking of a number
[00:04:24] between 1 and 1
[00:04:27] million you can try to guess what number
[00:04:31] that is go on think of a number see if
[00:04:34] you can guess it you've got a number in
[00:04:37] your head now let me tell you this the
[00:04:40] number that I'm thinking of is either
[00:04:43] the number that you have just guessed or
[00:04:47] it is the number
[00:04:50] 47,3 2 do you want to stick with your
[00:04:53] original guess or would you like to
[00:04:56] switch to the only other remaining
[00:05:00] option of those 1 million numbers which
[00:05:02] is 47,3 to it should become a little bit
[00:05:05] more obvious the chance that you got it
[00:05:08] right in the first time is 1 in a
[00:05:10] million and by me now telling you that
[00:05:12] every other number is wrong and giving
[00:05:14] you only two choices remaining the
[00:05:20] 999,999
[00:05:23] chance out of a million is concentrated
[00:05:26] in the one remaining option and so this
[00:05:29] is the very similar thing with career
[00:05:30] choice when we are young when people are
[00:05:32] saying like hey what do you want to be
[00:05:33] when you grow up we don't know anything
[00:05:36] about anything at least if it was me I
[00:05:39] had no idea what it meant to be a doctor
[00:05:42] let alone when I was like 10 years old
[00:05:44] and so of all the different professions
[00:05:46] and jobs and career paths that are out
[00:05:48] there some of which don't even exist yet
[00:05:52] the chance that you just so happen to
[00:05:55] pick the career that is perfect for you
[00:05:58] on your first first go back when you
[00:06:01] were just barely able to function as a
[00:06:03] human being is really low as you get
[00:06:07] older and as you learn more you gain
[00:06:09] more experiences you learn more about
[00:06:11] those careers you learn more about the
[00:06:13] different options you learn more about
[00:06:15] yourself and what is important to you
[00:06:18] and what type of life you want to live
[00:06:20] these are doors opening for you and
[00:06:22] showing you what is behind all these
[00:06:26] different options and so when you're
[00:06:28] armed with that knowledge it is a good
[00:06:31] idea to change your decision I'm not
[00:06:34] saying you should always change because
[00:06:38] you may decide on a career path and you
[00:06:39] could genuinely love it and have a
[00:06:41] fulfilling life and if that happens
[00:06:44] great I am so very much happy for you
[00:06:47] however a lot of people aren't like that
[00:06:49] a lot of people will have regrets and
[00:06:52] second thoughts and want to change and
[00:06:54] wonder what else is in store for life
[00:06:57] they will not change because they think
[00:06:58] they shouldn't
[00:07:00] change so why is it that choosing to
[00:07:05] change careers feels so wrong well it's
[00:07:09] probably because you didn't get a pat on
[00:07:11] the back for it literally When We're
[00:07:13] Young everyone's always asking you what
[00:07:16] you want to be when you grow up and once
[00:07:17] you make that decision there's a lot of
[00:07:19] positive reinforcement everyone's like
[00:07:21] oh wow that's great you that's a good
[00:07:22] idea you get the pet on the back for it
[00:07:25] and you as a child are less uncertain
[00:07:29] and there's more Comfort there's more
[00:07:31] security because you've made the
[00:07:33] decision and over time you even start to
[00:07:35] form an identity around this and so when
[00:07:38] new information comes in that challenges
[00:07:40] this it's not just a challenge to a
[00:07:42] decision it is a challenge to an entire
[00:07:45] identity and challenging that also means
[00:07:49] opening up to all of this uncertainty
[00:07:51] that have been locked away for years I
[00:07:53] remember one time I was working with
[00:07:55] these two siblings the older sister
[00:07:57] wanted to become a doctor it was very
[00:07:59] clear about that and the younger sister
[00:08:00] had no idea what she wanted to do and
[00:08:02] the older one was always complaining
[00:08:04] about how the younger one like was
[00:08:05] directionless she entered a Comics
[00:08:07] degree and then dropped out entered an
[00:08:08] Arts degree and then dropped out and
[00:08:09] then was just working at a restaurant
[00:08:11] instead of studying and so she really
[00:08:13] was pretty aimless but here's the thing
[00:08:15] those two sisters they're the same the
[00:08:18] older sister had no idea what being a
[00:08:21] doctor really meant she just decided to
[00:08:23] do it and then after she decided that
[00:08:25] she didn't question it the younger
[00:08:27] sister didn't have any other idea years
[00:08:30] and also couldn't be bothered really
[00:08:32] thinking about it and so just didn't
[00:08:34] decide on anything both of them escaped
[00:08:38] the need to really critically think
[00:08:41] about and evaluate their career
[00:08:43] decisions the older one escaped by just
[00:08:45] making a decision and never questioning
[00:08:47] it and the younger one escaped by
[00:08:50] questioning everything and then just
[00:08:52] deciding not to do anything and
[00:08:54] unfortunately but as expected the older
[00:08:56] sister now is in hospital placements
[00:08:58] feeling already stressed because she
[00:09:00] kind of hates it and is now opening up
[00:09:03] that uncertainty for the first time in
[00:09:05] years so if our career decisions are
[00:09:08] probably going to be wrong to begin with
[00:09:11] then how are we meant to decide on a
[00:09:13] career at all well it is surprisingly
[00:09:16] simple there's three steps and the first
[00:09:18] step is to just get information you can
[00:09:21] only make a decision with what you know
[00:09:24] at that time and so we should be
[00:09:26] critical about any career that we have
[00:09:28] chosen think of it like purchasing a
[00:09:31] product you want to read the reviews the
[00:09:33] five-star reviews and the onestar
[00:09:35] reviews every career has its crappy
[00:09:37] parts and it's better to know about it
[00:09:41] and think about it rather than getting
[00:09:44] ambushed by it like 6 years later see
[00:09:46] the career for what it is not what you
[00:09:48] hope it will be and here's a pro tip you
[00:09:50] should always examine multiple careers
[00:09:54] at the same level of debt a lot of
[00:09:55] Premed students that I worked with used
[00:09:56] to tell me that they've learned a lot
[00:09:58] about being a dog they've spoken to
[00:10:00] doctors they've shadowed doctors they've
[00:10:01] watched YouTube videos they've read blog
[00:10:03] posts they've done all of this research
[00:10:05] and they know as much as they can
[00:10:06] possibly know about going into medicine
[00:10:09] and good for them but they also haven't
[00:10:11] explored any alternatives at least not
[00:10:14] nearly to the same level of depth so you
[00:10:16] can't really say that you've thought
[00:10:18] through all your options if you've
[00:10:20] actually only thought about one option
[00:10:22] step two once you've got information
[00:10:24] decide on something early but stay open
[00:10:28] even with all this information you're
[00:10:30] never really going to know some things
[00:10:32] until you're doing it and living it you
[00:10:34] can't just pause life and just like
[00:10:36] gather information forever in fact a lot
[00:10:38] of the information you can't even access
[00:10:41] until you are walking down that path so
[00:10:44] with the information you do have and can
[00:10:47] reasonably get make the best decision
[00:10:50] you can at least for now do whatever you
[00:10:53] need to do to pursue that career for now
[00:10:56] but stay open to the fact that that
[00:10:59] might change keep your eyes on the goal
[00:11:02] the goal is to build a life that you
[00:11:06] find fulfilling it is not to stay
[00:11:10] committed and loyal to a decision long
[00:11:13] past its expiry date like I said nothing
[00:11:15] is all good and no bad sometimes the
[00:11:18] bads are worth sticking around for but
[00:11:21] sometimes it's a sign that we need to
[00:11:23] move on which is why step three figure
[00:11:27] out what a worthwhile career actually
[00:11:30] means learn what the criteria for an
[00:11:33] ideal career truly is so that we know
[00:11:38] what is worth sticking around for and to
[00:11:41] do that you should check out the video
[00:11:43] that I made on this very topic right
[00:11:45] here so I'll see you in that video


=== The effective note taking strategy ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_8jUr8zOgE

[00:00:00] if you're spending a lot of time trying
[00:00:01] to make your notes pretty there's a good
[00:00:03] chance that that's actually harming your
[00:00:05] learning let me explain in order to
[00:00:06] learn effectively your brain needs to do
[00:00:08] three things number one it has to take
[00:00:10] information in number two it has to be
[00:00:12] able to arrange and organize that
[00:00:14] information in a way that makes sense so
[00:00:16] that it can stay in your memory and you
[00:00:18] have to be able to do that step without
[00:00:20] getting overloaded and that's where note
[00:00:22] taking comes in the right type of
[00:00:24] thinking that produces a good memory and
[00:00:25] a deep level of understanding is trying
[00:00:27] to form a big picture that means
[00:00:30] constantly going back and forth between
[00:00:32] Concepts and ideas moving things around
[00:00:35] grouping them simplifying them seeing
[00:00:37] how they all related together you're
[00:00:38] creating a network now it's very hard to
[00:00:40] do that if right from the beginning you
[00:00:42] are trying to create a perfect set of
[00:00:44] linear like beautiful looking notes they
[00:00:46] may look aesthetic but it's probably
[00:00:48] going to lock you into a really narrow
[00:00:50] isolated way of thinking it's much
[00:00:52] better to start really Missy and then
[00:00:54] try to clean it up eventually


=== Why following yours chedule perfectly won't help you ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmASKNd-PMw

[00:00:00] following my schedule perfectly actually
[00:00:03] harmed me more than it helped me back in
[00:00:05] my first year of uni as most of you know
[00:00:07] I had these intense 20 hour days of
[00:00:09] studying and I had this very rigorous
[00:00:11] schedule and most days I was able to
[00:00:13] finish everything that I set out but
[00:00:16] committing to that schedule and
[00:00:17] finishing it was probably detrimental
[00:00:20] because I made that schedule based on
[00:00:22] the processes I had at the time and how
[00:00:25] long it would take me to finish
[00:00:26] everything but I should have looked at
[00:00:29] how much time I need to invest to
[00:00:31] improve my processes and methods so I
[00:00:33] don't need to spend that much time but I
[00:00:35] didn't and I didn't invest any time in
[00:00:37] learning to learn more effectively and
[00:00:39] so I study 20 hours a day almost every
[00:00:40] day for like 9 months so as a rule
[00:00:43] moving forward for anyone if you feel
[00:00:46] like you have to spend a lot of time on
[00:00:48] something and you're always like trying
[00:00:50] to catch up look at your processes and
[00:00:52] see well how much time would you need to
[00:00:54] put aside to improve your processes so
[00:00:56] that that's not a problem for you
[00:00:58] anymore


=== Always look for evidence (including from me) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CMoiWBw_t8

[00:00:00] when you're an influencer in education
[00:00:02] like you're not influencing people about
[00:00:03] the brand of moisturizer they're using
[00:00:05] you are influencing the way that people
[00:00:07] go about their studies which impacts
[00:00:09] their self-esteem and their confidence
[00:00:11] and their grades and their career
[00:00:13] prospects and how they feel about what
[00:00:15] they can achieve in their life and if
[00:00:16] you are not accountable for your advice
[00:00:18] at least in my books that is not cool


=== Most students waste their time with notes ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHPfVW46eZE

[00:00:00] writing less completely changed my
[00:00:02] experience of lectures and look I'm not
[00:00:04] saying you need to have your notes messy
[00:00:08] forever I love the really nice aesthetic
[00:00:10] notes as much as anyone else it doesn't
[00:00:13] mean your notes have to look like the
[00:00:15] tangled web of cables behind your TV but
[00:00:18] in fact starting messy and then
[00:00:20] progressively cleaning up the mess is
[00:00:23] the best way to make it look nice and
[00:00:26] organized but in fact when you start
[00:00:28] messy and then you try try to
[00:00:30] progressively clean it up and make it
[00:00:32] more organized it has a beneficial
[00:00:34] effect on your memory and depth of
[00:00:37] understanding and that's the key that's
[00:00:38] The Sweet Spot when you start messy and
[00:00:40] you try to clean it up you get all the
[00:00:42] benefits of being able to think at that
[00:00:45] higher level and having notes that look
[00:00:47] good too


=== The illusion of having pretty notes ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2eNyUITgUw

[00:00:00] the thing about having notes that are
[00:00:01] like really aesthetic like # studygram
[00:00:03] these perfect notes is that it creates
[00:00:06] an illusion of learning the only way you
[00:00:08] can really create like these beautiful
[00:00:09] aesthetic nodes especially if that's
[00:00:11] like your first set of nodes is that if
[00:00:13] your brain is essentially turned off you
[00:00:16] have to be in a mentality where you're
[00:00:18] not really processing the information
[00:00:20] very deeply you're not thinking about
[00:00:22] too many things you give yourself the
[00:00:24] challenge of making something that looks
[00:00:26] really nice and then at the end of that
[00:00:27] you've got like a beautiful set of notes
[00:00:29] and it feels productive but this is an
[00:00:31] illusion of learning there isn't really
[00:00:33] anything that's happening in the brain
[00:00:35] that's helping with learning and in fact
[00:00:37] when you try to learn the right way
[00:00:40] you'll find that trying to make these
[00:00:41] really pretty notes actually stops your
[00:00:44] brain from thinking the way it needs to
[00:00:45] think and the fact that it's possible to
[00:00:47] write these perfect beautiful looking
[00:00:49] notes without actually even thinking
[00:00:51] about anything and the fact that it's
[00:00:53] kind of easy to do it that actually goes
[00:00:55] to show that it is a passive form of
[00:00:57] learning


=== Most students make this mistake ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcaNjrj_-T0

[00:00:00] it's easy to make these pretty notes
[00:00:01] while feeling productive we give
[00:00:03] ourselves a reasonable challenge of
[00:00:06] trying to make it look nice which
[00:00:08] creates the illusion of learning it's
[00:00:10] like trying to solve a puzzle perfectly
[00:00:12] the first time round there's no room for
[00:00:15] exploration or rearranging any of the
[00:00:17] ideas in fact the only way that we can
[00:00:19] create like this perfect set of notes
[00:00:21] first time round is if we skip step two
[00:00:23] the actual thinking and processing if we
[00:00:26] don't think about things much nothing
[00:00:28] becomes overwhelming

=== How studying less can help you learn more ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff4oLA6mXzY

[00:00:00] let's say you feel like you don't have
[00:00:01] enough time to study you're always
[00:00:02] falling behind you're always trying to
[00:00:04] catch up the solution to this is to
[00:00:07] study less hear me up the reason that a
[00:00:12] lot of people struggle with falling
[00:00:14] behind and never being able to catch up
[00:00:16] is because the process and the methods
[00:00:18] they're using I'm not efficient enough
[00:00:20] for the pace or the volume or the
[00:00:22] complexity of what they're trying to
[00:00:24] study they're using kind of like a
[00:00:25] method that might have worked for them a
[00:00:26] few years ago it's just not good enough
[00:00:29] as it is right now the reason that we
[00:00:30] have to study less is because we need to
[00:00:32] create time for ourselves to upgrade our
[00:00:35] methods and our systems if we don't
[00:00:37] create that time for ourselves we're
[00:00:38] going to be using the same dull ax uh to
[00:00:41] cut down the tree and it's always going
[00:00:43] to take the entire day to get through
[00:00:46] everything sometimes we have to take a
[00:00:48] shortterm loss like studying less to
[00:00:51] reinvest that in improving our processes
[00:00:53] so we give ourselves a chance of winning
[00:00:55] longterm


=== Most students never learn this skill ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPI8rYVcscA

[00:00:00] if you are thinking in the right way
[00:00:02] then your notes should be messy at first
[00:00:05] if you're trying to make pretty notes
[00:00:06] early on then it locks you into a pretty
[00:00:09] narrow isolated way of thinking about
[00:00:11] the information which is easier to do
[00:00:14] but it's actually less effective for
[00:00:15] Learning and you can still have pretty
[00:00:17] aesthetic notes you just got to start
[00:00:19] messy and try to simplify and organize
[00:00:22] it progressively over time rather than
[00:00:25] just making it pretty for the sake of it


=== I wasted my time at medical school ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7KOcJ96hrQ

[00:00:00] this probably wasted the most amount of
[00:00:02] time for me throughout all of medical
[00:00:03] school which was that I didn't utilize
[00:00:05] my clinical attachment days very
[00:00:06] effectively there were a lot of days
[00:00:08] where I rock up and I wasn't really
[00:00:10] interested in what was happening during
[00:00:11] the ward round I wasn't interested in
[00:00:13] what was happening during the patience
[00:00:14] like I didn't really even want to see
[00:00:16] patience because I felt like I had such
[00:00:19] a knowledge deficit that I just wanted
[00:00:21] to go and study like I would come to the
[00:00:23] hospital just to show face show my
[00:00:25] seniors like hey I'm around I exist
[00:00:28] please remember me for when you do my
[00:00:30] forms hey by the way can I go and just
[00:00:32] study now and thinking back on it it is
[00:00:34] important to take time independently to
[00:00:36] study but there's also a lot of learning
[00:00:38] that I could have gained from Clinical
[00:00:41] placements that I just completely
[00:00:43] ignored


=== The secret to studying your textbook ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He7YoXWA4nI

[00:00:00] going through for example Page by Page
[00:00:01] or chapter by chapter isn't always the
[00:00:04] best from forming a knowledge structure
[00:00:05] point of view you actually want to when
[00:00:07] I say um be Broad and superficial you
[00:00:09] actually want to do that across
[00:00:10] everything so if there's 50 pages it'd
[00:00:12] be best to do all 50 pages but just at
[00:00:14] the like shallowest level of detail so
[00:00:16] you're really skipping 99% of what's on
[00:00:18] every page but you're picking out the
[00:00:20] key Concepts and the key headings across
[00:00:22] the 50 pages and then you map that out
[00:00:24] cuz that's like the biggest picture and
[00:00:26] then in the next session you'd go in
[00:00:27] maybe one level deeper to get a little a
[00:00:30] little bit more resolution on that and
[00:00:31] then you might start with chapter one
[00:00:33] and going into a little bit more detail
[00:00:34] and fleshing it out but you want to make
[00:00:36] sure your big picture is as broad as you
[00:00:38] can manage it otherwise you'll end up
[00:00:39] having these very specific isolated
[00:00:42] segments of maps and they are actually
[00:00:44] all connected together but because
[00:00:45] they're so dense and fully formed it's
[00:00:47] actually really hard to see how you can
[00:00:49] how you can merge it


=== How to make studying easy ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLXmFAdsBNE

[00:00:00] things are only overwhelming if you lack
[00:00:02] the knowledge to find relevance with it
[00:00:05] and so the solution to that is to build
[00:00:07] the knowledge that would make it
[00:00:08] relevant so if I was an expert on trust
[00:00:11] estate tax and the laws around it then
[00:00:14] me reading this would be very very very
[00:00:16] easy I wouldn't be overloaded at any
[00:00:19] point reading through this so it's about
[00:00:20] where we draw that line what do we need
[00:00:22] to know to get one step closer to that
[00:00:24] so that what we read is not giving us
[00:00:27] overload so this is the very active
[00:00:29] component of of learning


=== Most students make this simple mistake ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01L44I_LFDM

[00:00:00] anytime you learn anything new the goal
[00:00:03] of you consuming that information is not
[00:00:05] to consume it in the exact way that it
[00:00:07] was presented to you the goal is to
[00:00:10] develop the expertise that the person
[00:00:12] had when they were creating that
[00:00:14] resource when they were writing that
[00:00:16] sentence writing that paragraph teaching
[00:00:17] this point the person that's teaching it
[00:00:19] has a certain type of expertise and a
[00:00:20] way of thinking about it your goal is to
[00:00:22] reconstruct the knowledge to be able to
[00:00:24] build that yourself rather than just
[00:00:27] sticking to potentially the same order
[00:00:29] and the same structure and the same
[00:00:30] syntax that was given to you often when
[00:00:32] you start learning in a way that is just
[00:00:35] presented in the same structure in the
[00:00:36] same order as a textbook or a course or
[00:00:39] something you're going to enter into
[00:00:40] overload very very quickly and then
[00:00:42] that's why you might feel like it takes
[00:00:43] a lot of effort to just stay engaged and
[00:00:45] concentrate and pick things through and
[00:00:47] then as you learn more and more it just
[00:00:49] continues to get more and more and more
[00:00:50] overwhelming


=== How to read a textbook efficiently ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MnoyE0HkiY

[00:00:00] a lot of the time what's on page one
[00:00:02] isn't always like going through for
[00:00:04] example Page by Page or chapter by
[00:00:06] chapter isn't always the best from
[00:00:08] forming a knowledge structure point of
[00:00:09] view you actually want to when I say um
[00:00:11] be Broad and superficial you actually
[00:00:13] want to do that across everything so if
[00:00:14] there's 50 pages it'd be best to do all
[00:00:16] 50 pages but just at the like shallowest
[00:00:19] level of detail so you're really
[00:00:20] skipping 99% of what's on every page but
[00:00:23] you're picking out the key Concepts and
[00:00:24] the key headings across the 50 pages and
[00:00:27] then you map that out cuz that's like
[00:00:28] the biggest picture and then the next
[00:00:30] session you'd go in maybe one level
[00:00:32] deeper to get a little bit more
[00:00:34] resolution on that and then you might
[00:00:35] start with chapter one and going into a
[00:00:37] little bit more detail and fleshing it
[00:00:38] out but you want to make sure your big
[00:00:40] picture is as broad as you can manage it
[00:00:42] otherwise you'll end up having these
[00:00:44] very specific isolated segments of maps
[00:00:46] and they are actually all connected
[00:00:48] together but because they're so dense
[00:00:50] and fully formed it's actually really
[00:00:51] hard to see how you can how you can
[00:00:53] merge it


=== Hope for people with Dyslexia ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltPztPtofJ8

[00:00:00] uh I just want to understand does this
[00:00:01] work similarly with people who have
[00:00:03] learning disabilities great question I
[00:00:04] haven't really talked about
[00:00:05] neurodiversity at all the short answer
[00:00:08] is that this method will be better than
[00:00:10] what they're probably doing right now
[00:00:12] the longer answer is that it really does
[00:00:13] depend there are certain conditions that
[00:00:15] we know are very minimally affected when
[00:00:18] they start using this dyslexia is a big
[00:00:20] one when people with dyslexia start
[00:00:21] learning in this way often the
[00:00:23] limitations that they feel with learning
[00:00:25] almost just disappear because it's so
[00:00:27] nonword dependent and it's so more
[00:00:30] organic in the way that they think and
[00:00:31] learn the dyslexia is one that can be
[00:00:33] overcome to a high magnitude


=== Improve your learning with ADHD ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhV8leaDnbc

[00:00:00] uh I just want to understand does this
[00:00:01] work similarly with people who have
[00:00:03] learning disabilities great question the
[00:00:04] short answer is that this method will be
[00:00:07] better than what they're probably doing
[00:00:09] right now for example ADHD especially
[00:00:11] with hyperd distractability that can be
[00:00:13] difficult because it requires time and
[00:00:14] attention to focus however there are
[00:00:16] other strategies that they can use to
[00:00:17] help increase Focus to do this and it's
[00:00:19] still going to be more engaging and
[00:00:21] therefore improve focus compared to what
[00:00:23] they're already doing which is just like
[00:00:24] trapping someone with ADHD in a in a box
[00:00:26] and just saying don't think about
[00:00:27] anything for 5 minutes you know it's so
[00:00:29] passive that not going to find success
[00:00:30] with that at all


=== THIS is more important than natural intelligence ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4kVjOIVXG4

[00:00:00] what is something that is more important
[00:00:02] for achievement especially academic
[00:00:04] achievement than natural intelligence
[00:00:07] well depending on where you live and
[00:00:09] what your beliefs are and your culture
[00:00:11] some people would say there is nothing
[00:00:13] more important and there is a very
[00:00:14] strong association between IQ and
[00:00:16] achievement in fact it's called the IQ
[00:00:18] achievement link however there is
[00:00:20] something that is probably more
[00:00:22] important than IQ and that is self
[00:00:26] disipline there's research that shows
[00:00:27] that self-discipline is more of a fact
[00:00:30] for influencing achievement than IQ is
[00:00:32] with the authors of one particular study
[00:00:34] saying that the reason that students
[00:00:37] probably do not live up to their
[00:00:38] intellectual potential is because they
[00:00:41] lack adequate self-discipline and so I
[00:00:44] say this because I work with a lot of
[00:00:46] students that feel like they cannot
[00:00:48] achieve because they're not as smart as
[00:00:51] the other guy so to that I say maybe
[00:00:53] there's something you can still do to
[00:00:56] get the advantage


=== I’m A Doctor. If You’re In Med School, Please Watch This Video ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e06y0rZ1-Ws

[00:00:00] going to medical school was an amazing
[00:00:02] unique experience that I never want to
[00:00:04] do again by the time I graduated medical
[00:00:07] school there are a lot of things that I
[00:00:09] wish I had done very differently and
[00:00:11] they would have made mid School much
[00:00:12] easier or saved me a lot of time and
[00:00:14] stress and so let me tell you the
[00:00:16] mistakes that I made I'll tell you what
[00:00:18] I did what problems it led to which
[00:00:21] weren't like that obvious at the time
[00:00:23] and then what I would do differently or
[00:00:25] how I managed to change things up by the
[00:00:27] time I graduated and hopefully it can
[00:00:28] save you some of the Str that I went
[00:00:30] through going through medical school
[00:00:31] myself for those of you that are new to
[00:00:32] the channel welcome I'm Dr Justin Sun
[00:00:34] I'm a learning coach and the head of
[00:00:36] learning at I can study but in my past
[00:00:38] life I worked as a junior doctor for a
[00:00:40] couple of years before deciding that my
[00:00:42] true passion and Alignment lay with
[00:00:45] education and educational
[00:00:46] entrepreneurship and social Enterprise
[00:00:48] and so that's what I do now so for the
[00:00:50] last 10 years I have been helping
[00:00:53] students from around the world learn to
[00:00:55] learn more efficiently so let's just
[00:00:57] jump into it with the first mistake that
[00:00:58] I made which was that I really over
[00:01:01] engineered a way of learning that was
[00:01:03] suited for exams and this was fine in my
[00:01:07] pre-clinical years and when I entered
[00:01:09] into my clinical attachments in
[00:01:11] hospitals uh which for me was in my
[00:01:13] third year of medical school I actually
[00:01:15] failed my first run that first one was
[00:01:17] General medicine or for those of you in
[00:01:18] North America Internal Medicine which
[00:01:20] you probably know is like a major major
[00:01:24] attachment and this came as a shock to
[00:01:26] me because I was doing reasonably well
[00:01:28] in my preclinical examinations so I
[00:01:32] didn't really expect to bomb so hard in
[00:01:35] my clinical attachment and the reason
[00:01:37] was because I was learning in a way that
[00:01:39] was fine for the exam but it wasn't
[00:01:41] translating very well to clinical
[00:01:43] placement and the way that I would need
[00:01:44] to use that knowledge in real life and
[00:01:48] so not only could I not really use my
[00:01:50] knowledge effectively but also I built a
[00:01:52] system that was really more around
[00:01:54] shortterm memory like learn it for this
[00:01:57] exam and then a month or two later I
[00:01:59] don't really needed anymore so I wasn't
[00:02:01] creating strategies that allowed me to
[00:02:03] build foundational knowledge and carry
[00:02:05] that through year after year so what
[00:02:07] ended up happening was that I would
[00:02:09] probably every single year of not only
[00:02:11] medicine but also working as a doctor
[00:02:13] relearn the same things that I had
[00:02:16] learned and just kept forgetting over
[00:02:18] and over and over again and so that was
[00:02:20] probably one of the biggest mistakes
[00:02:21] that I made was was just overlearning
[00:02:23] for exams without having more foresight
[00:02:26] into how I would need to use that
[00:02:27] information in the future but another
[00:02:29] aspect of it was that I wasn't very
[00:02:31] Discerning about the level of detail
[00:02:34] that I needed I had a general sense that
[00:02:37] I needed to learn everything and I was
[00:02:40] very focused on a lot of very specific
[00:02:42] details so I would have fragmented
[00:02:44] discret but like a copious amount of
[00:02:47] factually accurate technical specific
[00:02:49] information and detail but when it came
[00:02:52] to really understanding how everything
[00:02:53] worked at a big picture level I was very
[00:02:55] disjointed it was very fragmented so
[00:02:58] when I started seeing patients that
[00:03:00] didn't just have like this disease with
[00:03:02] this particular symptom cluster and they
[00:03:04] had atypical presentations of a disease
[00:03:06] and they were slightly older and they
[00:03:07] were on this medication and a previous
[00:03:09] comorbidity and they had this type of
[00:03:10] surgery and they also have this other
[00:03:11] disease and they've got this other thing
[00:03:13] which maybe is diagnosed or maybe not
[00:03:15] but you don't know cuz the record was
[00:03:16] from 20 years ago it just became way too
[00:03:18] confusing because I didn't know how all
[00:03:20] these different aspects interacted with
[00:03:22] each other to affect the presentation of
[00:03:25] the patient in front of me or the
[00:03:26] management for them moving forward and
[00:03:28] I'd look at my scene
[00:03:30] and they used to be a to like take all
[00:03:31] these things and just come to these very
[00:03:33] Nuance really well synthesized
[00:03:36] management plans and and differential
[00:03:38] diagnoses for the patients very quickly
[00:03:41] and it became obvious to me that it
[00:03:42] wasn't just because they had memorized
[00:03:44] more than me they fundamentally were
[00:03:46] able to see the patient and all that
[00:03:49] information through a different lens
[00:03:51] like it made sense to them in a way that
[00:03:52] it just did not make sense to me that
[00:03:54] was not about just knowing more facts I
[00:03:59] never already thought about how you can
[00:04:02] understand information in a different
[00:04:04] way through preclinical when I was in
[00:04:07] preclinical there was a method of
[00:04:09] understanding a topic that was given to
[00:04:12] me like this is how you learn
[00:04:13] antibiotics this is how you learn you
[00:04:15] know microbiology this is how you learn
[00:04:17] genetics this is how you learn Anatomy
[00:04:18] whatever it is and that is the way that
[00:04:20] I would learn it the way it was given to
[00:04:21] me is the way that I would learn it and
[00:04:23] if it was hard to understand it's just
[00:04:26] like I guess this is kind of a harder
[00:04:28] topic I just need to study more more I
[00:04:31] didn't go out of my way very often to
[00:04:34] look for a simpler way to put it all
[00:04:39] together as a proportion of time wasted
[00:04:41] this probably wasted the most amount of
[00:04:43] time for me throughout all of medical
[00:04:45] school which was that I didn't utilize
[00:04:47] my clinical attachment days very
[00:04:49] effectively there were a lot of days
[00:04:51] where I rock up and I wasn't really
[00:04:53] interested in what was happening during
[00:04:55] the ward round I wasn't interested in
[00:04:56] what was happening during the patience
[00:04:57] like I didn't really even want to
[00:05:00] see patience because I felt like I had
[00:05:03] such a knowledge deficit that I just
[00:05:06] wanted to go and study like I would come
[00:05:08] to the hospital just to show face show
[00:05:11] my seniors like hey I'm around I exist
[00:05:14] please remember me for when you do my
[00:05:16] marking forms hey by the way can I go
[00:05:18] and just study now and thinking back on
[00:05:21] it it is important to take time
[00:05:23] independently to study but there's also
[00:05:25] a lot of learning that I could have
[00:05:27] gained from Clinical placements
[00:05:30] that I just completely ignored there are
[00:05:33] just some things that you cannot learn
[00:05:36] from just studying like you need the
[00:05:39] patient there to be able to understand
[00:05:42] what you're learning in context to give
[00:05:44] it relevance and that's what I found was
[00:05:46] that when I was studying it purely
[00:05:48] academically I didn't have a sense of
[00:05:50] relevance for how I could use this
[00:05:52] information and all the nuances around
[00:05:54] it and so it was very hard for me to
[00:05:56] make sense of it and organize it because
[00:05:58] I just didn't know how I need to apply
[00:05:59] it at the end of this video I also talk
[00:06:01] about how you can make the most of
[00:06:03] clinical time this is what I recommend
[00:06:04] to all my clinical medical students now
[00:06:07] this is what I started doing in my final
[00:06:08] year of medical school and it it just
[00:06:10] makes clinical days so much more
[00:06:13] valuable okay so let me give you a
[00:06:14] couple of examples now specifically of
[00:06:16] things that I had learned like this
[00:06:17] wrong way and the way that I had changed
[00:06:20] it so that you've got a bit more context
[00:06:22] and I'll end off with like a few
[00:06:25] specific concrete recommendations that I
[00:06:27] would recommend for any medical student
[00:06:30] I promise you this is going to make your
[00:06:32] medical school life much easier much
[00:06:34] more enjoyable and just like you're
[00:06:36] going to save a lot of time so here's
[00:06:38] what happened I was sitting there in the
[00:06:40] ward and my consultant otherwise known
[00:06:42] as an attending physician he sat down
[00:06:44] after I saw a patient and he said okay
[00:06:46] your patient here has chest pain what
[00:06:49] are you thinking about and I said okay
[00:06:52] well there are some things it could be
[00:06:54] like it could be an MI mardan function
[00:06:56] it could also be a PE and I just could
[00:07:00] not think like I was choring for ideas
[00:07:04] for chest pain which is like the most
[00:07:06] typical like the most classical you know
[00:07:09] symptom that you should probably be
[00:07:11] prepared for and that's when I realized
[00:07:13] I'd never really thought about it from
[00:07:14] that perspective before like I had
[00:07:16] thought about it from such a disease
[00:07:18] Focus that i' never really thought about
[00:07:19] it from a symptom focus when someone
[00:07:22] just presents to you with whatever they
[00:07:24] have how can I navigate backwards to
[00:07:27] figure out what disease or diseas is I
[00:07:29] got going to sit in my differentials and
[00:07:31] I just couldn't use my knowledge in that
[00:07:32] direction it was just too fixed it was
[00:07:34] just too rigid and this came up time and
[00:07:36] time again it happened for diabetes it
[00:07:38] happened for shock uh because the way
[00:07:40] that I learned something like diabetes
[00:07:43] was that I learned it like this right
[00:07:45] I'd learn okay this is diabetes this
[00:07:47] panop these are the complications
[00:07:50] andever I tested myself I test myself
[00:07:52] like this as well hey what are the
[00:07:53] microvascular complications of diabetes
[00:07:54] Well the macrovascular complication of
[00:07:56] diabetes I didn't test myself from the
[00:07:58] other way around I didn't say okay let's
[00:07:59] say that someone has blindness in their
[00:08:01] eyes what are the differential diagnoses
[00:08:03] for that what are the possible things
[00:08:05] and what are the questions that you
[00:08:06] would have to ask to rule in or rule out
[00:08:08] certain diagnoses the clinical reasoning
[00:08:10] part of my studying I just did not think
[00:08:13] about it until way too late in my
[00:08:15] medical school and a lot of medical
[00:08:16] schools now have realized that that's a
[00:08:18] problem with the way that they teach and
[00:08:19] so there are these things they're
[00:08:21] technically called spiral curriculums or
[00:08:22] spiral integrated curriculums or
[00:08:23] integrated curriculums but the idea is
[00:08:25] that you have a lot of this clinical
[00:08:27] scenario thinking all the away from the
[00:08:30] beginning in your preclinical years
[00:08:31] which is a great step but I also work
[00:08:34] with a lot of students that are going to
[00:08:35] medical schools they teacher this way
[00:08:37] now and what I've realized is that they
[00:08:39] still compartmentalize it they still
[00:08:41] learn every disease as a disease basis
[00:08:44] first and then way way way way down the
[00:08:46] line they then try to go backwards and
[00:08:49] then they get overwhelmed and overloaded
[00:08:51] and because medical school is
[00:08:52] challenging and there's a lot of volume
[00:08:53] to study it's just too much and people
[00:08:56] just end up more confused and so one of
[00:08:58] the things that I wish I had done and
[00:08:59] then I started doing later on is I just
[00:09:02] studied it purely from the clinicals
[00:09:04] perspective first I learned it from a
[00:09:07] clinical reasoning perspective to begin
[00:09:09] with and then later when I'd understood
[00:09:12] that I'd come back to the path of
[00:09:13] physiology and then reinforce my
[00:09:15] learning at a disease Focus because that
[00:09:18] actually makes a lot more sense rather
[00:09:20] than learning the disease one by one and
[00:09:23] then trying to bring it together to see
[00:09:25] you know how you can look at it from a
[00:09:26] symptom first perspective I just learned
[00:09:29] it from a symptom and sign perspective
[00:09:31] first and then I worked my way through
[00:09:34] the differentials and then patted up
[00:09:36] with pathophysiology so if someone comes
[00:09:38] in with chest pain I would start
[00:09:40] thinking okay pain in the chest could
[00:09:43] come from the skin could come from the
[00:09:46] bones could come from the muscles I just
[00:09:47] work my way in could be the plura could
[00:09:50] be The myocardium could be
[00:09:53] neurogenic so I would start in that
[00:09:55] order and then I think okay so what are
[00:09:57] the things that I can think of that
[00:09:58] could be affecting things there and
[00:10:02] anytime I didn't understand or I thought
[00:10:04] I was missing something then I would go
[00:10:05] to learn more about that particular
[00:10:07] disease so that I would be able to work
[00:10:09] through my differential and clinical
[00:10:11] reasoning process a little bit more what
[00:10:13] this meant was that my knowledge was
[00:10:14] much more functionally organized to
[00:10:17] begin with and I had the same level of
[00:10:19] detail but I had much more context to it
[00:10:23] and a great example of where this came
[00:10:24] in handy was when I learned about shock
[00:10:27] so when I first learned shock in prein I
[00:10:29] learned it pretty much like this I just
[00:10:33] had all the different types of shock all
[00:10:35] the different possible ideologies the
[00:10:37] pathophysiologies and all the like
[00:10:38] various clinical findings like cardiac
[00:10:40] output is down or up or jvp is elevated
[00:10:43] or not or neutral or you post and heart
[00:10:45] raid like I would just learn all of
[00:10:47] these different things and I have these
[00:10:48] committed to flash cards actually you
[00:10:50] know what I literally for this
[00:10:51] particular topic I literally Drew
[00:10:54] handwritten cards and blue tacked them
[00:10:57] to my wall and I so proud because they
[00:10:59] were very pretty and I literally got no
[00:11:03] value out of it I probably looked at
[00:11:04] them like five times and uh I never
[00:11:08] really remembered anything about them to
[00:11:10] this day I don't remember what it looks
[00:11:11] like other than the fact that it used to
[00:11:13] hang right above the door handle on my
[00:11:15] wall so this is how I learned shock and
[00:11:18] I managed to you know pass all my exams
[00:11:20] if you ask me hey what are all the
[00:11:22] symptoms of hypo volic shock what are
[00:11:24] all the signs I would have been able to
[00:11:26] give you an answer honestly I don't
[00:11:27] remember anymore but when I worked in Ed
[00:11:31] my senior pulled me aside and he was
[00:11:34] like hey let's just talk about shock for
[00:11:35] a second he was like you know I know
[00:11:37] that when you go through mid School you
[00:11:39] learn it this way but let me show you a
[00:11:42] way that's just much faster so he takes
[00:11:44] a piece of just random clinical paper
[00:11:47] and he just draws a very simple diagram
[00:11:49] and he just says hey look at the end of
[00:11:50] the day shock is just about a pump the
[00:11:54] tubes that are connected to the
[00:11:57] pump sit sitting inside a container that
[00:12:01] is your body and then there's fluid
[00:12:04] being pumped through the tubes so if
[00:12:06] you've got shock it's either going to be
[00:12:08] a problem with the pump a problem with
[00:12:11] the tubes a problem with the container
[00:12:13] or a problem with the fluid and that's
[00:12:15] all the different types of shocks and he
[00:12:17] went through and then he mapped every
[00:12:20] single part of shock and all the
[00:12:22] different types and ideologies to this
[00:12:24] framework and he said so when you're
[00:12:26] seeing a patient all you need to do is
[00:12:27] ask yourself is there a problem with the
[00:12:28] pumps and you know exactly what
[00:12:29] questions to ask is a problem with the
[00:12:30] pipes you know the questions to ask is a
[00:12:32] problem with the fluid you know the
[00:12:33] questions to ask is a problem with the
[00:12:34] container you know the questions to ask
[00:12:36] and for me that was a transformative way
[00:12:39] of thinking one of the things that I
[00:12:40] said before was that I didn't spend a
[00:12:41] lot of time when I was studying
[00:12:43] academically to deliberately make things
[00:12:46] simpler and here's the reason why it
[00:12:49] would have helped me a lot because just
[00:12:51] looking for like an image for this video
[00:12:54] I actually found that there are a lot of
[00:12:55] other ways that of thinking about shock
[00:12:57] and I found this particular image here
[00:12:59] which classifies shock in a very similar
[00:13:01] very simple way and I don't know when
[00:13:04] this was published but if I had taken
[00:13:06] the time to deliberately take something
[00:13:08] that I thought was overwhelming and very
[00:13:11] detailed and say there must be a simpler
[00:13:14] more intuitive way to understand this
[00:13:17] what could it be if I had taken the time
[00:13:20] 10 15 20 minutes to take this
[00:13:23] information and deliberately try to make
[00:13:26] it simpler and more intuitive I probably
[00:13:29] probably could have arrived at this kind
[00:13:31] of or this kind of conclusion by myself
[00:13:35] years earlier but I didn't and as a
[00:13:38] result I had a gap in my knowledge and I
[00:13:41] wish I had done that for anatomy as well
[00:13:43] I've restudied Anatomy again and again
[00:13:46] and again almost every single year and
[00:13:47] it's only when I actually did a run in
[00:13:49] Orthopedics that it kind of clicked how
[00:13:51] I needed to be thinking about it and it
[00:13:53] clicked for me during surgery I was
[00:13:56] retracting a body cavity as you do
[00:14:00] just trying to maintain tension and not
[00:14:03] have the consultant surgeon yell at me
[00:14:05] we've all been there and also not trying
[00:14:07] to fall asleep it's a long operation
[00:14:08] it's like a 4 and 1 half hour operation
[00:14:11] just standing there almost falling
[00:14:13] asleep passing out and after the
[00:14:14] operation he comes out to me and he says
[00:14:17] so what did you learn and to be honest I
[00:14:20] learned that I hate retracting body
[00:14:23] cavities so I didn't really learn
[00:14:25] anything and I tried to make something
[00:14:27] up like oh it's really interesting
[00:14:28] seeing how you did the suture it was
[00:14:30] cool to see the hip replacement go in
[00:14:33] how you dealt with the bleeding and he
[00:14:35] was like okay okay okay it was like do
[00:14:36] you notice where I switched from using
[00:14:39] the the scalp of dimy and where I moved
[00:14:42] to blunt dissecting do you know why I
[00:14:44] did that and honestly first of all I
[00:14:47] didn't notice that he did that and
[00:14:48] second of all I had no idea why I wasn't
[00:14:51] even thinking about why and he proceeded
[00:14:53] to explain to me that that is the point
[00:14:55] at which the I can't remember I think
[00:14:57] may have been like a offshoot of the
[00:14:59] femoral artery like a very important
[00:15:01] artery passes around there so you need
[00:15:04] to be careful around that area which is
[00:15:06] why he stopped and he started blunt
[00:15:07] dissecting instead and I thought okay
[00:15:08] that's actually a really good point and
[00:15:10] I probably should have known that and
[00:15:12] now I feel like an idiot for not knowing
[00:15:14] that but that's also when I had the
[00:15:15] realization that the reason that you
[00:15:17] would need to know Anatomy is not just
[00:15:19] to know Anatomy but you need to use that
[00:15:21] knowledge somehow and I'd never really
[00:15:24] thought how to use the knowledge of
[00:15:26] anatomy Beyond like just a very obvious
[00:15:30] clinical corate that was taught to me in
[00:15:32] lectures so when I started going back
[00:15:34] through my anatomy and now thinking okay
[00:15:36] let's imagine that I'm
[00:15:39] operating how would I study the anatomy
[00:15:42] if I was operating and there's this
[00:15:45] really good scene in this like Korean
[00:15:49] movie like TV series on Netflix and
[00:15:52] there's this one medical student who has
[00:15:54] to perform surgery on this other person
[00:15:57] and because he's still a student he has
[00:15:59] has no idea how so he spends all night
[00:16:02] studying his Anatomy textbooks to devise
[00:16:05] a strategy for
[00:16:07] operating and the reason that I think
[00:16:08] that scene is really good is because
[00:16:10] that's exactly the way that I started to
[00:16:12] study I put myself in the position where
[00:16:15] I thought what if I'm the first person
[00:16:16] to ever do this operation how does that
[00:16:20] make me look at Anatomy differently and
[00:16:23] when I started doing that Anatomy became
[00:16:25] so much easier more engaging and more
[00:16:29] just enjoyable and more memorable to
[00:16:31] learn because there were consequences
[00:16:34] there was a context and a sense of
[00:16:35] relevance to what I was learning and
[00:16:37] again yes it does take longer but
[00:16:40] surprisingly not that much longer and
[00:16:43] the time you're spending is a lot more
[00:16:45] enjoyable and you just remember so much
[00:16:48] more that you're going to save your time
[00:16:50] like truckloads in the long run because
[00:16:53] something like Anatomy is useful for all
[00:16:55] forms of medicine like even saying
[00:16:58] someone's got chest pain to think well
[00:17:00] how can you work through that well you
[00:17:01] can take an anatomical approach well if
[00:17:03] you don't know your Anatomy well enough
[00:17:05] to think about the chest wall and work
[00:17:07] your way from out to in and understand
[00:17:08] the structures that are in place that
[00:17:10] cause chest pain that's not going to be
[00:17:12] very easy for you if you don't know your
[00:17:14] abdominal and Anatomy well enough that
[00:17:16] if someone says hey you've got like LIF
[00:17:17] upper quadrant pain and then you can
[00:17:20] work through anatomically to think where
[00:17:21] that could be caused from it's going to
[00:17:23] be very difficult whereas learning the
[00:17:25] anatomy very well sets a good foundation
[00:17:27] for all the other type of learning that
[00:17:29] you're going to have to do here are my
[00:17:31] final tips here's the things that I wish
[00:17:33] I had done that I encourage you to do
[00:17:37] first of all as much as possible
[00:17:41] whenever you can try to make things
[00:17:43] simpler and more intuitive don't just
[00:17:46] learn it the way that it's given to you
[00:17:48] find a way to understand it it may be
[00:17:50] less detailed but give yourself
[00:17:53] something simple to base things on I
[00:17:55] have a skeleton of a simple intuitive
[00:17:57] understanding and a framework to think
[00:17:59] through whenever you feel like man
[00:18:01] there's a lot to remember and a lot to
[00:18:03] memorize here whenever you feel that
[00:18:05] sense that this could be overwhelming
[00:18:07] find a way to break it down and make it
[00:18:10] simpler you can always go and learn the
[00:18:12] details and you should but you should
[00:18:14] always do that after you have a very
[00:18:16] simple intuitive way of understanding
[00:18:18] the entire topic it's going to help you
[00:18:20] also whenever possible look for the
[00:18:22] clinical coret ask yourself how am I
[00:18:25] actually going to use this knowledge
[00:18:27] before you try to learn anything through
[00:18:28] a patho Fizz or a disease or you know
[00:18:31] very discret isolated perspective find a
[00:18:34] way to think about it from a clinical
[00:18:36] perspective first understand it from a
[00:18:38] clinical perspective first and then go
[00:18:41] back to learn more details about the
[00:18:43] disease or the pathophys again it's
[00:18:45] going to make it much easier and it's
[00:18:46] going to make it make more sense and
[00:18:48] you're probably going to do better for
[00:18:49] all of your examinations as well because
[00:18:51] most medical schools around the world
[00:18:52] are transitioning towards having
[00:18:54] examinations that reflect clinical
[00:18:56] application of knowledge uh a little bit
[00:18:57] more closely remember you are not a
[00:19:00] medical student you are a doctor in
[00:19:03] training and that's a difference you can
[00:19:06] try to just keep memorizing and smashing
[00:19:08] things through forever but trust me it
[00:19:10] doesn't really work the friends that did
[00:19:14] that and got their way through medical
[00:19:15] school and thought hey why do you need
[00:19:16] to change the way that you're studying
[00:19:17] you just need to memorize it more now
[00:19:19] they're studying to become a specialist
[00:19:21] and they're having to relearn all that
[00:19:23] stuff all over again because they don't
[00:19:24] remember any of it and now they're
[00:19:26] having to learn it through the methods
[00:19:28] that I'm teaching you now and honestly
[00:19:30] there is no reason that you can't just
[00:19:34] learn it like how a specialist in
[00:19:36] training is trying to learn it when
[00:19:38] you're a pre-clin medical student it's
[00:19:41] just a better more intuitive way to
[00:19:44] learn the material my next tip is to
[00:19:46] pick your losses you really can't learn
[00:19:49] absolutely everything that you learn in
[00:19:50] medical school or just in medicine in
[00:19:52] general like it's straight up impossible
[00:19:54] and you do have to learn a lot of things
[00:19:56] so I would recommend that you kind of
[00:19:58] pick your losses don't try to learn
[00:20:01] everything make a decision about what is
[00:20:03] important for you to learn and why again
[00:20:06] coming back to that clinical application
[00:20:08] and the things that you feel are less
[00:20:09] important you can still try to fit them
[00:20:11] in when you've got time but don't try to
[00:20:14] cover everything the final tip here is
[00:20:17] just how to make use of clinical
[00:20:18] placements more effectively I said that
[00:20:20] I talk about this at the end and this is
[00:20:22] the final tip when you're going into a
[00:20:23] clinical placement there is a wealth of
[00:20:25] information that you can possibly
[00:20:27] extract Center you're studying based on
[00:20:30] the likely things you will learn from
[00:20:33] your next day or week in clinical
[00:20:35] practice don't study the things that are
[00:20:37] like less relevant if you know that the
[00:20:40] common conditions you're likely to see
[00:20:42] in a given placement chest pain and
[00:20:44] shortness of breath and some kind of
[00:20:47] skin rash and you like headache back
[00:20:49] pain center your studying around those
[00:20:52] things because what you want to do is
[00:20:53] you want to study something and the very
[00:20:55] next day you want to have a clinical
[00:20:58] experience
[00:20:59] that builds on what you just studied
[00:21:01] that could be through seeing a patient
[00:21:03] or it could be attending a surgery if
[00:21:05] you know that you have to spend time in
[00:21:07] theater and you're going to be there
[00:21:09] observing a surgery anyway study about
[00:21:12] that condition and that surgery the day
[00:21:14] before so that when you're in there
[00:21:17] having the mandatory experience and
[00:21:19] spending the time that you cannot Escape
[00:21:21] you are at least engaged and you are
[00:21:23] gaining value from that there is some
[00:21:25] part of your learning that is being
[00:21:26] built on and consolidated and that also
[00:21:29] allows you to ask very good questions
[00:21:32] that your senior is going to realize you
[00:21:35] really are putting an effort to getting
[00:21:36] learning out of this experience and
[00:21:38] that's something they appreciate because
[00:21:39] trust me when I started having students
[00:21:42] under me when I was a doctor it's very
[00:21:45] very clear to see which students
[00:21:47] actually care and put in effort and
[00:21:49] which ones are just there to burn time
[00:21:52] and the ones that are there to burn time
[00:21:54] you don't really feel very motivated to
[00:21:56] help them along whereas the ones that
[00:21:58] are motivated you are more motivated as
[00:22:00] well to teach them and help them be
[00:22:03] involved in more things and to you know
[00:22:04] go out of your way a little bit more to
[00:22:06] help their education and I really regret
[00:22:08] what I did when I was in my you know
[00:22:10] early rotations in clinical placements
[00:22:13] where the things that I would be
[00:22:14] studying on a daily basis with things
[00:22:17] that my University curriculum said that
[00:22:18] I need to learn by the end of that
[00:22:20] placement and it wasn't really based
[00:22:21] around the experiences that I
[00:22:24] anticipated that I'd have the next day
[00:22:26] or or during that week and what I've
[00:22:28] realized now is if IID focused it on
[00:22:30] those clinical experiences I would have
[00:22:33] covered probably 90 95% of what I would
[00:22:36] have needed to know based on what my
[00:22:38] University mandated and the other 5% I
[00:22:40] could have just easily fitted in around
[00:22:42] that time or just before my assessment
[00:22:44] it wouldn't have been a problem but
[00:22:45] instead I wasted a lot of time and Ward
[00:22:49] rounds and clinical attachment days were
[00:22:52] so draining and so tiring and I was not
[00:22:54] very- engaged and I didn't get a lot of
[00:22:55] value out of them because I didn't do
[00:22:57] this so a bit of a long video
[00:22:58] but I hope this has helped you I
[00:23:00] certainly wish someone sat down and told
[00:23:02] me this stuff when I went into medical
[00:23:04] school if you want some more techniques
[00:23:06] around what to do specifically during
[00:23:08] lectures or with your note taking or
[00:23:11] with your revision strategies or
[00:23:12] revision timing or what to do with your
[00:23:14] flash cards and make them more effective
[00:23:16] these types of other specific techniques
[00:23:18] I do also have a guided step-by-step
[00:23:20] program where I've taken all of these
[00:23:22] techniques looking at the research
[00:23:24] triing them and seeing what works and
[00:23:26] what doesn't across thousands of
[00:23:28] students stud and packaging it into a
[00:23:30] single guided step-by-step program that
[00:23:33] teaches you an entire Learning System if
[00:23:35] you're interested in that you can check
[00:23:37] that out at Icon study.com there's a
[00:23:38] link in the description I also have a
[00:23:40] ton of other videos that provide more
[00:23:42] specific techniques that you can check
[00:23:43] out on my YouTube thank you so much for
[00:23:44] watching I hope this helps and I'll see
[00:23:46] you next
[00:23:49] time


=== Overwhelmed in lectures? Do THIS ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yWVMTCVlbE

[00:00:00] one of the most effective techniques to
[00:00:01] learn any new information in almost any
[00:00:03] context whether it's lectures or for
[00:00:05] work is called priming now the way that
[00:00:08] learning works is you want to be in this
[00:00:10] optimal zone of cognitive load which is
[00:00:12] basically mental effort how hard you're
[00:00:14] thinking when it's too high we're
[00:00:16] getting confused and overwhelmed so it's
[00:00:19] very easy to get overwhelmed when you
[00:00:20] learn something for the first time cuz
[00:00:21] there's a lot of detail and a lot to get
[00:00:23] through so we want to avoid that with
[00:00:25] priming with priming you might take
[00:00:27] something and just skim through it
[00:00:29] familiar yourself with some of the key
[00:00:31] terminologies some of the more difficult
[00:00:33] parts and ask yourself how it's all
[00:00:35] connected together at a very simple
[00:00:38] level when you do that your brain knows
[00:00:40] a little bit more and has more to work
[00:00:42] with so that when you go and learn it
[00:00:44] more properly later on it's less likely
[00:00:47] to get overwhelmed you can do this for
[00:00:50] Just 2 to 5 minutes before a lecture and
[00:00:52] you will notice an immediate difference


=== Are you bored when studying? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBQ2drLih0c

[00:00:00] you can never motivate a student to do
[00:00:01] something that they hate doing that they
[00:00:03] suck at doing that they get terrible
[00:00:04] results from there's no reason for them
[00:00:06] to be motivated by connecting the
[00:00:07] studying with learning it creates
[00:00:09] intrinsic motivation when we learning in
[00:00:11] this way it is engaging who felt engaged
[00:00:13] while they were doing that just now it's
[00:00:14] almost impossible not to be engaged when
[00:00:16] you're doing this and that is in itself
[00:00:18] actually enjoyable well maybe not quite
[00:00:20] yet it wasn't as enjoyable but I mean
[00:00:22] probably actually compared to just go
[00:00:24] study something doing this actually is
[00:00:26] more enjoyable to do it's more engaging
[00:00:28] and because the retention and the
[00:00:30] understanding become deeper that
[00:00:32] positively reinforces for the student


=== Stop trying to remember things when studying ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tlEhS9adXU

[00:00:00] as soon as you start trying to remember
[00:00:02] or understand the definition you lose
[00:00:04] because now you're focusing on the piece
[00:00:06] so this is a critical thing we need to
[00:00:07] develop something that I call a radar
[00:00:09] the radar is being able to detect when
[00:00:11] you are now in lower order learning if
[00:00:13] you notice that now you're focused on
[00:00:15] the piece you have to take that as a
[00:00:16] sign to take a step back and focus on
[00:00:18] the picture


=== How to stay ahead of the learning curve ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VKToNqFyCU

[00:00:00] India has one of the largest education
[00:00:01] systems in the whole world imagine if
[00:00:02] the whole education system of India
[00:00:04] started flipping to higher order
[00:00:05] learning imagine the global impact and
[00:00:07] it's unfathomable for me to imagine what
[00:00:10] it would be like to have an entire
[00:00:11] generation of students that are higher
[00:00:13] order Learners where each generation is
[00:00:15] the population of the United States it's
[00:00:16] ridiculous to think about that and we I
[00:00:19] think are the first movers that are
[00:00:20] going to push that change and so when
[00:00:22] you go out there and leave this room I
[00:00:23] would like you to leave a ripple I don't
[00:00:24] want to be the stone that drops on the
[00:00:26] concrete I want that to leave a ripple
[00:00:28] and you leave the Ripple and then that
[00:00:30] creates the change that creates the
[00:00:31] movement


=== Pretty notes = PASSIVE learning ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfVTLLjMSec

[00:00:00] the thing about having notes that are
[00:00:01] like really aesthetic like # studygram
[00:00:04] these perfect notes is that it creates
[00:00:06] an illusion of learning the only way you
[00:00:09] can really create like these beautiful
[00:00:11] aesthetic nodes especially if that's
[00:00:12] like your first set of nodes is that if
[00:00:15] your brain is essentially turned off you
[00:00:18] have to be in a mentality where you're
[00:00:20] not really processing the information
[00:00:22] very deeply you're not thinking about
[00:00:24] too many things you give yourself the
[00:00:26] challenge of making something that looks
[00:00:28] really nice and then at the end of that
[00:00:30] you've got like a beautiful set of notes
[00:00:32] and it feels productive but this is an
[00:00:35] illusion of learning when you try to
[00:00:37] learn the right way you'll find that
[00:00:39] trying to make these really pretty notes
[00:00:41] actually stops your brain from thinking
[00:00:44] the way it needs to think and the fact
[00:00:45] that it's possible to write these
[00:00:47] perfect beautiful looking notes without
[00:00:50] actually even thinking about anything
[00:00:52] and the fact that it's kind of easy to
[00:00:53] do it that actually goes to show that it
[00:00:55] is a passive form of learning


=== What is effective learning? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnKEgvX35Mg

[00:00:00] in learning we know that when new
[00:00:01] information has more connections to it
[00:00:03] and those connections are more
[00:00:04] meaningful we're more likely to hold on
[00:00:06] to that information our retention is
[00:00:08] better and our depth of understanding is
[00:00:09] better on the other hand if new
[00:00:10] information has fewer connections or
[00:00:12] those connections are very superficial
[00:00:14] then they're probably just going to fade
[00:00:15] very quickly anyway it may look like
[00:00:17] it's very connected but those
[00:00:18] connections weren't very significant and
[00:00:20] our brain is pretty good at pruning all
[00:00:22] of those off


=== What is encoding? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFNFGgGsQV8

[00:00:00] and the brain's ability to construct
[00:00:01] memory is something that we call
[00:00:03] encoding which depends a lot on the
[00:00:06] connections that you're able to make
[00:00:08] with new information when you build more
[00:00:09] connections you're able to retain it
[00:00:11] more and generally speaking when you've
[00:00:13] got more connections you also have more
[00:00:14] ways of using that knowledge for example
[00:00:17] like complex problem solving or more
[00:00:18] nuanced applications


=== Stop using this as an excuse... ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc8-XZNDVaE

[00:00:00] learning styles is a theory that became
[00:00:01] popular and it basically says that the
[00:00:03] human brain has a certain style of
[00:00:05] learning like visual auditory read and
[00:00:06] write or kinesthetic that it is better
[00:00:08] at and therefore finding that learning
[00:00:10] style will make you a better and more
[00:00:12] efficient learner but after Decades of
[00:00:14] research we know that that is actually
[00:00:15] not the case all people benefit from
[00:00:18] using multiple learning styles and the
[00:00:20] human brain is vastly better at
[00:00:22] processing visual information than
[00:00:24] basically any other type of information
[00:00:26] and certainly there are learning
[00:00:27] preferences but those are usually
[00:00:30] because of Prior experiences and habits
[00:00:33] rather than something that is biological
[00:00:35] or innate


=== How does memory work? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGl_8doXecs

[00:00:00] lot of people think that if you're a
[00:00:01] good learner you have a good memory and
[00:00:04] then if you're not a good learner then
[00:00:05] you have a bad memory and your memory is
[00:00:07] more like a leaky bucket but that is not
[00:00:09] really how your brain works memory is
[00:00:11] not really something that you have
[00:00:13] memory is really something that you
[00:00:14] construct rather than a warehouse to be
[00:00:17] filled it is more a building that you
[00:00:19] are constructing the quality of your
[00:00:21] memory is determined by the quality of
[00:00:24] the process that you used when you were
[00:00:26] thinking about the information in the
[00:00:28] first place it's like the residue view
[00:00:30] of thought naturally if you don't build
[00:00:32] something very well then it doesn't last
[00:00:33] very long so if you have a bad memory it
[00:00:36] probably means that you're just
[00:00:37] constructing it poorly


=== How To Become A Top 1% Learner (Without Being Smart) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iv4YPQVmTc

[00:00:00] how do top Learners actually learn in
[00:00:04] lectures you probably know there's
[00:00:06] people that are at every lecture they're
[00:00:08] super engaged they're never falling
[00:00:09] asleep in class they are remembering way
[00:00:12] more than you do even though you both
[00:00:13] attended the same lectures how is there
[00:00:16] something that they're doing that you
[00:00:17] just can't see or are they really just
[00:00:20] that much smarter well in this video I
[00:00:23] want to talk about how important natural
[00:00:24] intelligence really is based on the
[00:00:26] research and some strategies that you
[00:00:28] can use to make lectures much more
[00:00:30] valuable first things first how much
[00:00:33] does your natural intelligence or IQ
[00:00:36] really matter most people are not really
[00:00:40] extremely excellent deep processors but
[00:00:42] don't worry it doesn't mean it's the end
[00:00:45] of the world for you 50 years ago that's
[00:00:47] probably what someone would have said is
[00:00:49] that your intelligence can't really be
[00:00:51] trained but fortunately that's not the
[00:00:54] case research over the last two three
[00:00:56] decades especially in the last 10 11
[00:00:58] years has show that yes although your IQ
[00:01:02] is strongly associated with your ability
[00:01:05] to perform academically in some cases in
[00:01:08] the research this is called the IQ
[00:01:09] achievement link there's a lot we can do
[00:01:13] within our IQ and our IQ can actually
[00:01:16] grow but interestingly some other
[00:01:18] research on this finds that self
[00:01:20] discipline is actually more of an
[00:01:22] influencer than IQ and one of the
[00:01:25] studies even concludes that a major
[00:01:27] reason for students falling short of
[00:01:29] their intellect actual potential is your
[00:01:31] failure to exercise self discipline
[00:01:34] which in my case my personal experience
[00:01:37] is very very true if I think about
[00:01:38] myself back in high school like I didn't
[00:01:42] have really any self-discipline to speak
[00:01:45] of honestly I just play games all the
[00:01:46] time and then when I entered into
[00:01:47] University I was like really really
[00:01:50] really disciplined like I stopped
[00:01:51] playing games I went C- turkey on pretty
[00:01:53] much everything I went actually really
[00:01:54] over the top but as a result my academic
[00:01:57] performance was like massively improved
[00:02:00] and for a lot of students that I work
[00:02:02] with I see a very similar thing not in
[00:02:05] that they necessarily are lacking
[00:02:07] discipline on a day-to-day basis a lot
[00:02:09] of students are studying really hard but
[00:02:11] where I see a lack of discipline
[00:02:12] sometimes is a lack of consistency with
[00:02:15] improving their methods and learning new
[00:02:17] skills like they'll have a certain set
[00:02:18] of techniques or methods of note taking
[00:02:21] or handling lectures that they're used
[00:02:22] to and even though it's not really
[00:02:24] working they're not really consistent or
[00:02:26] disciplined in working on a new method
[00:02:29] to replace that and so inevitably they
[00:02:32] just continue to get the same result
[00:02:33] that they've always been getting and one
[00:02:34] of the things that I've observed is that
[00:02:36] while it's true that not every student
[00:02:38] can become like this once in a
[00:02:39] generation genius most students can
[00:02:42] relatively improve compared to their
[00:02:44] Baseline and that Improvement is often
[00:02:47] surprisingly significant like someone
[00:02:50] that is normally achieving you know like
[00:02:52] 40 or 50% in a test in my experience
[00:02:55] they can go up to 70 80 90% with a bit
[00:02:58] of training and the reason is because
[00:03:01] most people in the mainstream have never
[00:03:03] really been trained on how to learn
[00:03:06] effectively they're just using like a
[00:03:07] haphazard combination of techniques and
[00:03:09] habits that they've picked up over the
[00:03:10] years and so when you actually start
[00:03:12] training them they become much more
[00:03:14] effective at using their intellectual
[00:03:17] potential and I sort of think of it like
[00:03:19] learning a new sport not everyone can
[00:03:21] become a NBA basketball player but most
[00:03:25] people can be relatively bitter at
[00:03:29] playing basketball if they actually
[00:03:32] train and learn the right techniques so
[00:03:34] the next question is what are the right
[00:03:38] skills to use for example in lectures
[00:03:40] well the easiest way to figure that out
[00:03:42] is to look at what some top students are
[00:03:43] doing and then copy them if you agree
[00:03:46] with that statement you'll be wrong okay
[00:03:49] so to explain why that that would be a
[00:03:51] terrible idea to just copy success let
[00:03:54] me give you a example let's imagine that
[00:03:58] you are a doctor haven't put this on in
[00:04:00] a while let's say that a pharmaceutical
[00:04:02] company comes up to you and says that
[00:04:04] they've got a drug it's called treatment
[00:04:06] tall and treatment tall is meant to be
[00:04:08] effective for a disease caus disease
[00:04:11] itis now you've got patients with
[00:04:13] disease itis and the pharmaceutical
[00:04:14] company tells you that
[00:04:17] 99% of the people that have recovered
[00:04:19] from disease itis took treatment all do
[00:04:23] you recommend it to your patients think
[00:04:26] about this let's say that there are a
[00:04:28] million people with disease
[00:04:51] [Music]
[00:05:25] [Music]
[00:05:29] a reason for their success it might just
[00:05:32] be a common technique that a lot of
[00:05:34] people use and they themselves might
[00:05:36] have sufficient deep processing to allow
[00:05:39] them to be successful regardless of the
[00:05:41] technique that they use which is why I'm
[00:05:43] always saying if you're wanting to
[00:05:44] become a more efficient learner you have
[00:05:46] to understand the principles of learning
[00:05:48] and do your own evaluation what is your
[00:05:52] level what are your weaknesses and your
[00:05:54] strengths and create a method of
[00:05:56] learning that is going to be optimized
[00:05:58] for that not just taking what someone
[00:06:00] else does in their own context with
[00:06:03] their own brain and expecting to get the
[00:06:04] same results yourself most of the time
[00:06:07] it doesn't work like that now there's a
[00:06:09] lot of research on what exactly is an
[00:06:11] effective technique and a lot of
[00:06:12] researchers have tried to isolate
[00:06:13] exactly what works and what doesn't
[00:06:15] research is very complicated here are a
[00:06:16] few studies that I would recommend just
[00:06:18] starting with if you're interested but
[00:06:20] if you want to cut to the chase it's
[00:06:21] really about managing what's called
[00:06:24] cognitive load that's a central theme of
[00:06:27] A lot of these effective techniques so
[00:06:29] cognitive load is basically your mental
[00:06:31] effort it's how hard you have to think
[00:06:34] and how hard you have to try to like
[00:06:37] organize something or process something
[00:06:39] or make sense of the information like if
[00:06:41] I start speaking to you in some obscure
[00:06:44] language that you've never heard of
[00:06:45] before then you're going to be exerting
[00:06:47] a lot of mental load trying to figure
[00:06:49] out what I'm saying likewise if I'm
[00:06:51] teaching something and I'm teaching it
[00:06:52] in a way that is very very hard to
[00:06:55] follow and extremely complicated you're
[00:06:56] going to be using a lot more cognitive
[00:06:58] load uh it's the same for when you're
[00:07:00] you know like reading a book if it's in
[00:07:02] very very technical dense language you
[00:07:04] need to use a lot more cognitive load to
[00:07:06] try to get through it and the trick to
[00:07:08] learning effectively is about keeping
[00:07:10] your cognitive load in an optimal State
[00:07:12] I've talked about this in a lot of other
[00:07:13] videos before and the summary of it is
[00:07:15] that you basically don't want your
[00:07:17] cognitive load to get too high cuz then
[00:07:18] you'll be overloaded but you also don't
[00:07:20] want to be too low because that means
[00:07:22] that you're not really using your brain
[00:07:24] and therefore you're not actually
[00:07:25] learning and that's kind of like the
[00:07:26] worst waste of time a great example of
[00:07:28] that would be like just reading and
[00:07:30] rereading and then rewriting notes
[00:07:31] multiple times the cognitive load
[00:07:33] involved in that is very very low and
[00:07:35] that's something that we call passive
[00:07:37] learning and remember kids passive
[00:07:40] learning will kill you or at least it's
[00:07:42] pretty bad for you anyway cognitive load
[00:07:45] management is something that is not easy
[00:07:48] to do Straight off the bat and this is
[00:07:50] partly because cognitive load can happen
[00:07:52] for multiple reasons for example if
[00:07:54] you're trying to study but then the
[00:07:56] neighbor's dog is barking constantly you
[00:07:59] now have to exert cognitive load to
[00:08:01] ignore the Barking Dog so in this case
[00:08:03] your cognitive load may be kind of high
[00:08:06] but it's not high for a good reason it's
[00:08:08] not high cuz your brain's trying to make
[00:08:09] sense of it it's not high because you're
[00:08:11] processing it it's just High because
[00:08:13] you're distracted so that's not good
[00:08:15] increase in cognitive load whereas if
[00:08:17] your cognitive load is high because as
[00:08:19] you're reading you're trying to piece it
[00:08:21] together think about it connected relate
[00:08:24] compare and contrast ideas these are the
[00:08:27] things that produce high quality
[00:08:28] learning so this this case cognitive
[00:08:30] load would be high for a good reason so
[00:08:32] we want our cognitive load to be
[00:08:34] reasonably high for good reasons and we
[00:08:37] want anything that creates cognitive
[00:08:39] load for a bad reason to be reduced or
[00:08:43] removed that might have sounded a little
[00:08:44] bit complicated hopefully you could
[00:08:46] follow that so let me give you some
[00:08:47] examples I have some lectures here I
[00:08:49] just found a random lecture slide about
[00:08:51] network security don't ask me why I'm
[00:08:52] studying network security it just
[00:08:54] randomly popped into my head and there
[00:08:56] are some free slides that I found here
[00:08:58] from I think it was in state school so
[00:09:00] if this is a lecture and let's say I've
[00:09:02] got my lecture slides available before
[00:09:04] the lecture if not maybe I've got some
[00:09:06] textbook chapters maybe I've got
[00:09:08] previous students notes that I'm using
[00:09:10] or a course guide or something it
[00:09:12] doesn't really matter just to give me a
[00:09:13] basic idea one of the really effective
[00:09:15] things that you can do before going into
[00:09:17] a lecture is to Prime yourself priming
[00:09:21] basically just means that you give your
[00:09:23] brain a little bit more to work with so
[00:09:26] if you're introduced to something really
[00:09:27] really Technical and detailed you don't
[00:09:30] need to exert so much cognitive load to
[00:09:32] make sense of it so for example if I was
[00:09:34] going into the lecture and I'm reading
[00:09:35] this for the first time you know for me
[00:09:37] cuz I'm a total Noob I don't know what
[00:09:39] any other this stuff really means so if
[00:09:41] I you know if I look at Transport
[00:09:43] Security I I I know what an IP address
[00:09:45] is IP protocol stack I don't really know
[00:09:47] what that is IP layer security protocol
[00:09:49] like again I don't really know what that
[00:09:51] is these acronyms I like know what they
[00:09:54] are but I again don't really like
[00:09:56] understand and that's like just the
[00:09:57] intro and if I go in and start learning
[00:09:59] this for the very first time at this
[00:10:01] level of detail I'm going to be very
[00:10:02] overloaded because I'm not going to
[00:10:04] really know what's going on and I'm
[00:10:05] going to be overwhelmed very quickly in
[00:10:07] other words my cognitive load is going
[00:10:09] to overload probably almost you know
[00:10:11] immediately within the first few minutes
[00:10:13] and then for the rest of the lecture I'm
[00:10:14] sort of dead you know like my brain's
[00:10:16] not really doing anything and I'm going
[00:10:18] to leave the lecture feeling more
[00:10:19] confused than when I came in and so
[00:10:20] we've really lost to begin with and so
[00:10:23] the idea with priming is we want to give
[00:10:24] ourselves just enough knowledge so that
[00:10:26] when we look at this it's not so
[00:10:28] unfamiliar now there's lots of ways that
[00:10:30] we can do this I've talked about how you
[00:10:31] could do this with nonlinear note taking
[00:10:33] if you want to check that video out you
[00:10:34] can have a look over this one uh but
[00:10:37] there's also much simpler ways that you
[00:10:38] can do it if you're not really too
[00:10:40] comfortable with nonlinear note taking
[00:10:42] yet but it all comes down to isolating
[00:10:44] down what are the keywords what are
[00:10:46] pieces of terminology get a general
[00:10:49] understanding of those keywords and
[00:10:51] terminology and start thinking to
[00:10:53] yourself how they all fit together you
[00:10:55] can do this by writing out a list of
[00:10:57] questions that you want to prompt
[00:11:00] yourself with during the lecture so for
[00:11:02] example if I have a word that says IPC
[00:11:04] processing here and I've got another
[00:11:06] word that's like IPC implementation then
[00:11:08] I might ask the question how are IPC
[00:11:10] implementation and processing related to
[00:11:13] each other or dependent on each other
[00:11:14] you take the keywords you think about
[00:11:16] how they might be related to each other
[00:11:18] if you can represent that on some
[00:11:19] nonlinear notes great it's going to be
[00:11:22] more convenient for you alternatively if
[00:11:24] you're not super comfortable with
[00:11:26] nonlinear note taking yet you can just
[00:11:28] write down some keywords write the
[00:11:30] definition in the simplest terms that
[00:11:32] you can possibly do you don't want to be
[00:11:35] writing down definitions but then the
[00:11:36] definitions are so complicated that
[00:11:38] you're now exerting cognitive load to
[00:11:40] just remember the definition if you're
[00:11:42] going to write definitions you want to
[00:11:43] make sure that is simple enough that
[00:11:45] when you read it you're like yep I
[00:11:47] pretty much understand what it means and
[00:11:49] even if it's not at the technically best
[00:11:52] level it's still better than not having
[00:11:55] anything and it will be better than
[00:11:56] having one that's really really
[00:11:57] technical but so comp applicator that
[00:11:59] you can't actually understand so write
[00:12:02] down the key words write down some key
[00:12:04] questions uh and then during the lecture
[00:12:06] you can look at the questions and now
[00:12:08] you've got certain Milestones of
[00:12:10] thinking to help your brain sort of
[00:12:12] process that information and because
[00:12:14] you've already familiarized yourself
[00:12:15] with some of that terminology the
[00:12:17] lecture is less confusing and if you've
[00:12:18] done well you've also thought about some
[00:12:20] of the relationships between them so
[00:12:22] when the lecturer talks about some of
[00:12:23] the relationships again it's a little
[00:12:25] bit more familiar so again this is all
[00:12:28] about Prime yourself so now the second
[00:12:31] thing that we can do is to take that
[00:12:33] concept of asking questions and we can
[00:12:35] actually extend on that a little bit
[00:12:37] further there's a really effictive part
[00:12:40] of learning that comes from having to
[00:12:41] elaborate on something but elaborating
[00:12:44] on something doesn't just mean
[00:12:46] explaining it more or going in more
[00:12:48] depth a big part of elaboration is about
[00:12:50] figuring out how a concept is shaped
[00:12:54] what are the edges where does it apply
[00:12:56] where does it not apply and what are the
[00:12:58] relationships that are less obvious and
[00:13:01] so an easy way that we can try to
[00:13:02] trigger this is by asking nonobvious
[00:13:06] questions so an example if I use
[00:13:09] information network security as an
[00:13:10] example might be this term that says
[00:13:12] authentication header so an obvious
[00:13:15] question would be usually something like
[00:13:18] what is authentication header or what is
[00:13:21] the importance or significance of an
[00:13:24] authentication hitter what is the
[00:13:26] advantage of an authentication hitter
[00:13:29] right so these are things that are
[00:13:30] usually very factual and very discret
[00:13:33] they may ask about how it relates to
[00:13:35] other Concepts as well however the
[00:13:37] answer is usually relatively simple and
[00:13:40] it's something that most people will be
[00:13:41] expected to know asking these questions
[00:13:44] is valuable as well but most of the time
[00:13:47] you're going to learn that anyway if we
[00:13:49] are going to the effort of thinking of
[00:13:51] questions to ask that are really going
[00:13:53] to help us with our learning it's
[00:13:54] worthwhile thinking about the questions
[00:13:56] that people might not be asking and a
[00:13:59] very quick and you know like kind of
[00:14:02] reliable is way of doing this that I do
[00:14:04] you know pretty often is I try to look
[00:14:06] for the things that don't seem related
[00:14:09] to each other at first glance for
[00:14:12] example it could be something at the
[00:14:13] beginning of the lecture like IPC
[00:14:15] implementation and I might scroll all
[00:14:17] the way down to something that seems a
[00:14:18] little bit less relevant like Hub and
[00:14:21] spoke VPN right so I might look at those
[00:14:23] two things and again I don't actually
[00:14:25] know if those two things are actually
[00:14:26] Rel to each other but I might say well
[00:14:28] how are those two things is related and
[00:14:30] for most topics any concept is related
[00:14:33] to any other concept even if that
[00:14:36] concept relationship is indirect and
[00:14:39] somewhat distant there's some kind of
[00:14:41] relationship and forcing yourself to
[00:14:43] think about that also forces you to
[00:14:46] revise all the different relationships
[00:14:47] and interactions along the way whereas
[00:14:50] when you ask about questions that are
[00:14:53] very very obvious and the relationships
[00:14:54] between the ideas are like super super
[00:14:56] apparent then it's so easy that it's not
[00:14:59] really testing or challenging you
[00:15:01] whereas if you ask about a relationship
[00:15:03] between two concepts that are pretty far
[00:15:05] apart then you have to go through
[00:15:07] multiple different hypotheses to figure
[00:15:10] out which path actually makes sense it's
[00:15:13] kind of like solving a maze you know the
[00:15:16] entrance is here you know the exit is
[00:15:18] here but you're not really sure how to
[00:15:20] go from the entrance to the exit so you
[00:15:22] have to go through multiple paths in the
[00:15:24] middle to try to figure it out and in
[00:15:26] doing that it actually re enforces and
[00:15:29] consolidates the knowledge and it also
[00:15:32] allows you to whether it's before a
[00:15:34] lecture during a lecture or after a
[00:15:37] lecture hit that topic from multiple
[00:15:41] different angles and all of these things
[00:15:43] help to improve your memory and your
[00:15:45] ability to apply that information this
[00:15:47] is a really good one because it really
[00:15:49] doesn't take very long you could think
[00:15:51] of maybe four or five nonobvious
[00:15:54] questions in just like one or 2 minutes
[00:15:57] usually even if there's no real answer
[00:16:00] to that question just the fact that
[00:16:03] you're trying to answer the question is
[00:16:05] valuable because it's making you explore
[00:16:07] all these different options if you've
[00:16:09] watched some of my other videos you
[00:16:10] might see some similarities between this
[00:16:12] and Inter leing and indeed this can also
[00:16:15] be a method of interleaving if you
[00:16:17] haven't checked out my inter leaving
[00:16:18] video you can check that one out here
[00:16:20] now I mentioned that all of these things
[00:16:21] relate back to cognitive load the first
[00:16:23] one priming it's obvious because that's
[00:16:25] taking dense pieces of information
[00:16:28] breaking it down
[00:16:29] simplifying it and giving your brain a
[00:16:31] little bit more to work with so that
[00:16:33] it's not so overloaded during a lecture
[00:16:35] and the second one reduces cognitive
[00:16:36] load because when you ask these
[00:16:38] non-obvious questions it helps your
[00:16:40] brain think in a certain direction
[00:16:42] instead of saying how does everything
[00:16:44] fit together it gives it a little bit
[00:16:46] more of a purpose a little bit more of a
[00:16:48] focus your brain likes having a narrow
[00:16:51] Focus so that also helps reduce
[00:16:53] cognitive load because it means that you
[00:16:54] can do productive relational thinking
[00:16:57] which is good for building knowledge
[00:16:59] without as much of the confusion of just
[00:17:01] kind of mindlessly looking for
[00:17:03] relationships but there's probably
[00:17:05] nothing that helps quite as much as this
[00:17:08] third thing which is to filter and
[00:17:11] Screen information much more critically
[00:17:14] so most top Learners are pretty
[00:17:16] selective about what they're going to
[00:17:18] learn and when they're going to learn it
[00:17:19] well most top Learners are not going to
[00:17:21] study absolutely everything at the
[00:17:23] maximum level of depth from the very
[00:17:25] beginning and if they are and that's how
[00:17:27] they're able to be suc successful their
[00:17:30] natural deep processing level is
[00:17:31] probably completely off the chart and I
[00:17:34] can guarantee you that that's just not
[00:17:36] going to work for the vast majority of
[00:17:38] people what we mean by filtering out
[00:17:40] information is that when you read
[00:17:41] through something there are certain
[00:17:42] pieces of information that are going to
[00:17:44] be more suitable for your current level
[00:17:47] uh and what makes sense to you right now
[00:17:49] and there going to be some things that
[00:17:50] are so detailed that you're just not
[00:17:52] ready to learn it yet and the way that
[00:17:54] you can tell is very very simple which
[00:17:57] is you simply ask yourself
[00:17:59] do I know enough about this to make it
[00:18:03] simpler so when you read it if you read
[00:18:06] something and you don't understand it
[00:18:07] enough to even make it simple you
[00:18:10] probably don't have enough knowledge
[00:18:12] about it to really consolidate it into
[00:18:14] your memory and organize it so you're
[00:18:17] probably going to then study it and that
[00:18:19] knowledge is going to fade away and
[00:18:20] you're going to wonder where all that
[00:18:21] knowledge went so for me a complete Noob
[00:18:23] knowing nothing about this when I read
[00:18:25] this slide actually I can probably
[00:18:27] simplify that but if I read uh if I read
[00:18:29] this slide it's complicated enough for
[00:18:32] me and I know so little that I don't
[00:18:34] really feel like I can simplify this uh
[00:18:38] and and make it easier to understand
[00:18:40] while keeping it accurate and so as a
[00:18:42] result it means that the information on
[00:18:44] this slide for my current level is not
[00:18:47] appropriate it's too detailed what I
[00:18:49] need to do is I need to find an easier
[00:18:51] version of the same concept or I mean in
[00:18:54] this case cuz I've literally not studied
[00:18:56] this before it would be maybe to go back
[00:18:58] to some of these fundamental ones and
[00:19:00] make sure that I understand some of the
[00:19:01] more fundamental concepts but the way
[00:19:02] that it works is that knowledge is like
[00:19:04] building blocks they build on each other
[00:19:07] so when you start with a building block
[00:19:09] that is right at the very top at the top
[00:19:11] level of detail there's nothing for it
[00:19:13] to stack onto and then you're going to
[00:19:17] have to spend more time rebuilding it
[00:19:19] again and again but it doesn't matter
[00:19:21] how many times you put the block at the
[00:19:23] Top If there's no Foundation it's going
[00:19:25] to fall every single time and that's
[00:19:28] what causes a a lot of unnecessary
[00:19:30] repetition and learning if you know that
[00:19:32] as soon as you try to put it there you
[00:19:34] don't even understand it well enough to
[00:19:35] simplify it then you may as well just
[00:19:37] dial it back to the version of that
[00:19:40] information that is simple enough for
[00:19:42] you to make sense of it and once you
[00:19:43] have locked that in you can go up one
[00:19:45] level of detail and up one level of
[00:19:47] detail and so on a single slide there
[00:19:51] might be multiple different layers of
[00:19:54] detail some things are easy to
[00:19:56] understand some things are difficult to
[00:19:57] understand and your job is to filter out
[00:19:59] what is easy enough for me to learn now
[00:20:02] and what is harder so I will come back
[00:20:04] to it later you can keep a list on the
[00:20:07] side you can use Post-it notes to remind
[00:20:09] you of the things that you have skipped
[00:20:11] so that you do come back to them but
[00:20:13] it's very very important that the first
[00:20:15] time you learn something you do not
[00:20:17] learn everything the first go because
[00:20:20] some of that detail is going to be too
[00:20:23] much for you to handle right now and it
[00:20:24] is much more efficient for you to come
[00:20:26] back to it later when your foundation
[00:20:29] are stronger and the reason this is so
[00:20:31] good for lectures is because if you've
[00:20:33] been doing the other methods I told you
[00:20:35] about just now and you've primed
[00:20:37] yourself that means that during the
[00:20:39] lecture you already have some
[00:20:42] foundations there is a mid level that
[00:20:44] you know is going to be appropriate for
[00:20:46] you and then there is a extra level of
[00:20:48] detail that the lecturer might talk
[00:20:50] about that you know straight off the bat
[00:20:52] is too much for you to hold on to and so
[00:20:54] instead of exerting your precious
[00:20:56] cognitive load and trying to understand
[00:20:58] that you say okay that's the stuff that
[00:21:00] I can come back to later when I'm
[00:21:02] studying this later and you can direct
[00:21:04] your focus on the stuff that you think
[00:21:06] is at the right level of detail for you
[00:21:08] at that time and you can come back to it
[00:21:10] instead by looking at lecture recordings
[00:21:12] or like lecture notes or slides or
[00:21:15] whatever it is that you've got available
[00:21:17] uh one thing that can help you is if you
[00:21:19] are recording the lecture you can look
[00:21:21] at your watch to see what time it is
[00:21:25] when you decide that something is too
[00:21:27] detailed and you can make a long of all
[00:21:29] the time so that when you're going
[00:21:30] through the lecture you can actually go
[00:21:32] back to the particular moments that you
[00:21:33] skipped which is probably a lot more
[00:21:36] effective than just like watching a
[00:21:37] lecture at triple the speed uh because
[00:21:41] again just because you can listen to
[00:21:42] someone three times as fast doesn't mean
[00:21:44] that you can learn three times as fast
[00:21:46] in fact most people probably can't learn
[00:21:48] fast enough to catch up to one times
[00:21:50] speed so you know again that's kind of a
[00:21:52] misnomer uh watching a lecture faster
[00:21:54] does not actually make you learn faster
[00:21:57] yeah there a little bonus tip for you so
[00:21:59] next time you're on lecture give these a
[00:22:00] go thanks for watching and I'll see you
[00:22:02] next
[00:22:05] time


=== Why don't they teach us to learn like this? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd5ruuQGY40

[00:00:00] when we're grouping different pieces of
[00:00:01] information together there are some ways
[00:00:03] of grouping it that are very very
[00:00:04] logical often the way the textbook will
[00:00:05] give it to you is very logical the way
[00:00:07] lecturers teach it will be very logical
[00:00:08] but it doesn't make it intuitive so let
[00:00:10] me give you an example here right
[00:00:11] pericardium versus what do you think
[00:00:13] I'll say next art so myocardium could be
[00:00:16] right but there's so so at that point
[00:00:18] it's kind of like okay well first of all
[00:00:19] if I didn't already have really good
[00:00:21] domain knowledge about that will I be
[00:00:22] able to figure that out probably not and
[00:00:24] especially if that's new information
[00:00:26] you're learning then that's going to be
[00:00:28] additional cognitive resources for you
[00:00:29] to try to remember that grouping so now
[00:00:31] you have to not only remember like what
[00:00:33] parakum or myocum means but now you have
[00:00:35] to then remember that's the way that you
[00:00:36] grouped it right whereas if I were to
[00:00:38] say for example outer versus what do you
[00:00:40] think the next one's going to be it just
[00:00:42] makes sense right you don't have to even
[00:00:43] exert any if it to think about that if I
[00:00:45] say up versus down if I say left versus
[00:00:47] right um if I say before versus after we
[00:00:50] could add a during in there if we wanted
[00:00:52] to this is intuitive you know um cause
[00:00:54] versus effect and you can utilize domain
[00:00:56] knowledge but we want to get it to the
[00:00:58] point where it is like obvious


=== Students: WRITE your notes by hand ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_ElCcXDm90

[00:00:00] try not to type notes because of the
[00:00:01] fact that typing is at the moment with
[00:00:03] the limitations of technology in most
[00:00:05] cases linear and sequential and it's
[00:00:06] very difficult to do nonlinear notes now
[00:00:08] there are apps that allow you to create
[00:00:10] relationships but that's not really good
[00:00:12] either because yes you created the
[00:00:13] relationship but it isn't really you
[00:00:15] that created the relationship the
[00:00:16] relationship was actually created for
[00:00:17] you by the software and it doesn't allow
[00:00:19] you to have the higher level which is to
[00:00:21] really discriminate and prioritize
[00:00:22] relationships the key is actually
[00:00:24] thinking about the relationship and then
[00:00:25] creating a critical decision about how
[00:00:28] important that relationship is and where
[00:00:30] whether you want to represent it so even
[00:00:31] where you place things on a page how
[00:00:33] thick you make a certain Arrow whether
[00:00:35] you choose to have an arrow there and
[00:00:37] the direction that the arrow goes in
[00:00:39] these are all things that actually force
[00:00:41] you to think about that relationship to
[00:00:42] a deeper level because there's a very
[00:00:44] big difference between knowing A and B a
[00:00:45] related and then that leads to see and
[00:00:47] knowing exactly how important that is
[00:00:49] the context and the purpose that it has
[00:00:51] so as a result freehand tends to be
[00:00:53] better at demonstrating that and it's
[00:00:54] much faster than trying to get that
[00:00:56] level of discrimination through software


=== Do you check your learning objectives? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM9UfJVLlQs

[00:00:00] depending on your curriculum sometimes
[00:00:01] the lecture objectives are actually
[00:00:02] written in a way that indicates what
[00:00:04] level they're interested in so for
[00:00:06] example the lecture objective might
[00:00:08] actually say that what they want from
[00:00:09] you is to be able to describe the
[00:00:12] something something something which
[00:00:13] suggests that it's a lower order Mastery
[00:00:15] they looking for whereas if the lecture
[00:00:17] objective uses words like discuss
[00:00:19] evaluate contrast these are indications
[00:00:22] that they want that higher order flare


=== Most students are wasting time on notes ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wOJH-zeRzQ

[00:00:00] when you do good note taking it should
[00:00:01] achieve a couple of objectives number
[00:00:03] one is obviously to have information
[00:00:05] documented so that you can refer to
[00:00:06] later in in your study but arguably more
[00:00:08] important than that it's about
[00:00:09] facilitating the right cognitive
[00:00:11] processes and thought processes and what
[00:00:13] facilitating and cognitive processes
[00:00:16] really mean is that it needs to be
[00:00:18] making it easier and taking away
[00:00:20] unnecessary Parts like your brain is a
[00:00:22] vehicle with a fixed capacity there's
[00:00:24] only so much it can handle note taking
[00:00:26] should offset some of that unnecessary
[00:00:29] load so that it can really focus on
[00:00:30] doing the heavy lifting that's important
[00:00:32] for creating good learning


=== This is how you should read a text book ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGf-kxkMZaw

[00:00:00] a textbook you should not be going
[00:00:01] through it from beginning to end that
[00:00:02] single textbook you want to go through
[00:00:04] that same textbook five six times the
[00:00:06] first time you go through it just start
[00:00:08] picking up on the ideas that feel easier
[00:00:10] for you to process but create a web so
[00:00:12] yes it's easier for you to process it
[00:00:13] but you don't want to just be like lazy
[00:00:15] and just making it easy for the sake of
[00:00:16] making it easy your brain is able to
[00:00:18] handle so much cognitive load like
[00:00:20] mental effort for example you can't just
[00:00:22] open up a textbook and just memorize all
[00:00:23] of it in a single goat it's just too
[00:00:24] much but the way I think about it is
[00:00:26] like volume we can only take in let's
[00:00:27] say 10 pieces of information in a single
[00:00:29] goat so now we spread through the entire
[00:00:31] chapter or the entire book to think what
[00:00:33] are the 10 biggest ideas that are here
[00:00:35] and how are they related to each other
[00:00:37] what purpose does it serve Why is it
[00:00:38] important why do I need to know this and
[00:00:40] you form a structure of these big 10
[00:00:42] landmarks and go through it again so now
[00:00:43] that I have these landmarks there are
[00:00:45] more question well these two things are
[00:00:46] connected together but how exactly does
[00:00:48] that work now we're ready to learn about
[00:00:50] that


=== The Unique Behaviours of Top 0.1% Students ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-gv78haobI

[00:00:00] okay I have got this Theory and that is
[00:00:02] that top students have been top students
[00:00:06] long before they ever got a top result
[00:00:10] so I have known for a very long time
[00:00:12] that you can teach two different people
[00:00:14] the exact same technique and they can
[00:00:15] have wildly different results what is it
[00:00:18] that makes a top student at the top and
[00:00:22] just for some context I think I've
[00:00:23] managed to be reasonably academically
[00:00:25] successful in my own life but the
[00:00:27] version of me like 18 years old trying
[00:00:29] to plaw my way into medical school is
[00:00:32] very different from the version of me
[00:00:33] that graduated medical school and then
[00:00:35] after working with so many students
[00:00:37] trying to help them to become
[00:00:38] academically successful as well I've
[00:00:41] learned a lot of things because yes
[00:00:43] there are tips and tricks that you could
[00:00:44] see on like a 30-second Tik Tok but at
[00:00:46] the end of the day a lot of those really
[00:00:49] quick tips and tricks are not impactful
[00:00:51] enough to produce a sustainable
[00:00:53] long-term impact and when you work with
[00:00:55] so many students oneon-one for so many
[00:00:57] years there are certain patterns that
[00:00:59] you see in terms of what works and what
[00:01:01] doesn't now when it comes to being a top
[00:01:02] learner most people can train themselves
[00:01:05] to use a method of studying where it
[00:01:07] feels more engaging and more enjoyable
[00:01:10] where they are good enough at it that
[00:01:12] they actually find the process to be
[00:01:13] enjoyable because most humans really
[00:01:15] love to learn but most people really do
[00:01:18] not like to study because the way they
[00:01:20] study is not actually helping them learn
[00:01:22] effectively and I talk about this topic
[00:01:24] literally all the time in all my other
[00:01:25] videos however I also know that only a
[00:01:28] very small percentage of the people that
[00:01:30] watch my videos will be able to achieve
[00:01:33] those really top results and as an
[00:01:35] educator what's really important for me
[00:01:37] is that I'm producing as much of an
[00:01:39] impact as widely as possible because
[00:01:41] obviously just watching a video on
[00:01:43] learning is not really enough otherwise
[00:01:45] everyone will be a super efficient
[00:01:46] learner it's different between knowing
[00:01:49] how to be good and actually being good
[00:01:52] so I think the first part is to
[00:01:53] understand that the reason most people
[00:01:56] don't get bitter in the first place is
[00:01:58] because they have barriers to
[00:01:59] Improvement rather than not knowing the
[00:02:02] next best Technique No one is really
[00:02:04] good when they first start learning
[00:02:06] something and everyone is going to have
[00:02:08] some kind of challenge as they're trying
[00:02:10] to improve so the people that are the
[00:02:12] most successful are the ones that are
[00:02:13] able to systematically remove those
[00:02:15] barriers progressively so that one day
[00:02:18] they actually get to being good everyone
[00:02:21] is capable of improving but no one can
[00:02:24] improve if the barriers are not removed
[00:02:26] and this is why I think these
[00:02:28] prerequisites of Excellence are actually
[00:02:30] more important than techniques
[00:02:31] themselves and one of the biggest
[00:02:33] barriers that I see especially with
[00:02:34] students that are in high school and
[00:02:36] University becomes really clear when I
[00:02:38] think about working with students versus
[00:02:40] working with like entrepreneurs and CEOs
[00:02:42] one of the biggest differences is that
[00:02:44] often when I work with like an
[00:02:46] entrepreneur they haven't necessarily
[00:02:48] done amazing in school and they haven't
[00:02:50] been in school for like potentially
[00:02:52] decades so when I teach them to learn
[00:02:55] more efficiently it's a little bit more
[00:02:57] of a blank slate they don't have such
[00:03:00] strong habits of learning and they're
[00:03:02] not so fixed and also their belief about
[00:03:05] what they can do and how they can
[00:03:07] succeed is a little bit wider it's a
[00:03:09] little bit more holistic there isn't a
[00:03:11] preconceived notion that I have to do
[00:03:14] this in order to be successful whereas
[00:03:16] often when I work with students they
[00:03:18] have very very fixed habits partially
[00:03:21] like cultural and from their own
[00:03:23] previous history as well as what like
[00:03:25] teachers and the education system around
[00:03:26] them tells them this is how you need to
[00:03:29] learn this is what you need to study
[00:03:31] this is how many hours you need to study
[00:03:33] and they're comparing themselves with
[00:03:34] their friends and you know their family
[00:03:36] friends you know like distant cousin or
[00:03:38] whatever whereas when I work with these
[00:03:40] high power really successful
[00:03:42] entrepreneurs they know that they don't
[00:03:44] have to do the same thing as everyone
[00:03:45] else like they're free to explore and
[00:03:49] experiment and understand themselves and
[00:03:51] then build something that works for them
[00:03:52] and here's a really really good reason
[00:03:55] why you should not really place that
[00:03:58] much value and important on your
[00:04:01] existing habits of learning they are
[00:04:04] probably not that good and I'm not
[00:04:07] saying that in like a way like I'm not
[00:04:09] like indirectly dissing you the point is
[00:04:11] that most of the habits that we form on
[00:04:14] learning are based on just our prior
[00:04:16] experiences like you learn a certain way
[00:04:18] going you know through early childhood
[00:04:20] and then entering into like primary
[00:04:22] school and secondary school and our
[00:04:23] habits of learning are often not really
[00:04:26] based on someone teaching us a right
[00:04:28] method they're just things that we tried
[00:04:31] and then the people around us did and
[00:04:33] then teachers told us that we should do
[00:04:35] and it's just kind of a mix of all of
[00:04:36] these things if you asked me like 20
[00:04:38] years ago what's the best way to study
[00:04:41] there just really wasn't a lot of
[00:04:42] research to know and the research that
[00:04:44] was there was honestly like not very
[00:04:47] good and so the techniques that have
[00:04:49] become
[00:04:49] mainstream are really like outdated and
[00:04:53] we know a lot more about how the brain
[00:04:55] works and how learning should be now
[00:04:57] than we did a decade ago and then now
[00:04:59] when we add in the idea of like
[00:05:01] competition and insecurity and anxiety
[00:05:05] we really lean into the status quo bias
[00:05:08] which is this cognitive bias that means
[00:05:11] that we don't like to change we like to
[00:05:13] keep things the same and stable and when
[00:05:17] we introducing change if there's an exam
[00:05:18] coming up around the corner that creates
[00:05:20] insecurity and anxiety and then we're
[00:05:22] not willing to experiment and that means
[00:05:24] that our habits just get
[00:05:29] with a top top learner one of the things
[00:05:32] that I very consistently find is that
[00:05:34] they are much more critical about what
[00:05:36] works and what doesn't and they are much
[00:05:38] less attached to their methods and they
[00:05:41] are more attached to the process they
[00:05:43] use to refine their methods when I talk
[00:05:47] with people that are like really
[00:05:48] struggling with learning and they
[00:05:51] haven't had great experiences and
[00:05:52] they're not achieving great results
[00:05:53] there's a lot of dependency and like
[00:05:56] insecurity attached with their learning
[00:05:58] there are certain methods that they've
[00:06:00] been told work that they have used and
[00:06:03] they know it doesn't really work that
[00:06:05] well for them however they just continue
[00:06:08] to attach themselves to it because the
[00:06:09] idea of moving on to something else
[00:06:11] creates a lot of that anxiety really top
[00:06:14] Learners they are much more focused on
[00:06:17] just producing the result like if
[00:06:19] they're using a method and it's not
[00:06:20] quite producing the outcome that they
[00:06:22] want they are much faster and more
[00:06:24] aggressive and more open to changing it
[00:06:26] up and experimenting on it to figure out
[00:06:29] the combin that does work for them and
[00:06:32] they don't care so much about what other
[00:06:34] people are doing they are in a way I
[00:06:37] suppose more like leaders rather than
[00:06:38] followers and so in a way it's kind of
[00:06:40] like a poetic irony because a lot of
[00:06:43] lower Achievers you know people that are
[00:06:46] like really really struggling they're
[00:06:47] just trying to get the pass or they're
[00:06:48] like putting in like 100 hours a week
[00:06:50] studying and they're still not getting
[00:06:52] the results as that other like top
[00:06:53] learner their main method of trying to
[00:06:56] improve is to just copy success they see
[00:06:59] a top learner doing something and they
[00:07:01] just straight away copy that not
[00:07:03] realizing that you can't do that because
[00:07:06] you're not the same and so finding what
[00:07:09] works for your brain and your level of
[00:07:12] processing experience is really
[00:07:14] important because if you don't you're
[00:07:16] going to be continually trying to copy
[00:07:19] this other person using their techniques
[00:07:21] and wondering why you're not getting the
[00:07:22] same results it's kind of like trying to
[00:07:25] learn how to drive a car for the first
[00:07:27] time by watching Formula 1 races a lot
[00:07:30] of what they're doing is just not going
[00:07:31] to be applicable to you because you
[00:07:33] either do not have the vehicle or you're
[00:07:35] not operating in that kind of context so
[00:07:37] one of the biggest pieces of advice that
[00:07:38] I would give is don't try to copy
[00:07:41] success don't use that as your Milestone
[00:07:44] the goal for any learner trying to
[00:07:46] become more effective and more efficient
[00:07:47] is to challenge their methods and to try
[00:07:51] to do more with less it's not about
[00:07:55] having more techniques it's not about
[00:07:57] having more hours it is is about using
[00:08:00] the same number of hours and the same
[00:08:03] number of techniques but trying to get
[00:08:06] more value out of it if you're using
[00:08:08] like four different techniques for
[00:08:10] studying and you're already studying
[00:08:11] like 50 60 hours a week doing more is
[00:08:15] not going to make a difference you need
[00:08:17] to do less and get the same result or
[00:08:19] greater that's the way that you're going
[00:08:20] to increase your Effectiveness because
[00:08:22] you can always study more once you
[00:08:24] figured out how to get more value out of
[00:08:26] the time that you are spending so here's
[00:08:28] what I want to do now so that it drives
[00:08:30] the point home in terms of what a normal
[00:08:32] student does versus how a top student
[00:08:35] uniquely behaves I'm going to give you
[00:08:37] three different scenarios common
[00:08:40] scenarios that most students will find
[00:08:42] themselves in I'll tell you what a
[00:08:43] normal student tends to do versus what
[00:08:46] I've seen these top students doing
[00:08:49] instead so first scenario is getting
[00:08:51] repeatedly bad results in an exam one of
[00:08:55] the things that I would like always see
[00:08:58] that the average student do is as soon
[00:09:00] as they get a bad exam they just hope
[00:09:03] that the next exam will be better and
[00:09:05] this is going to be a recurring theme
[00:09:07] you'll see that most students a lot of
[00:09:10] their responses and strategies rely on
[00:09:12] luck whereas the top students are much
[00:09:15] more critical and methodical over time
[00:09:19] the normal student
[00:09:21] inevitably is not going to change much
[00:09:24] unless they get lucky whereas a top
[00:09:26] student over time they will inevitably
[00:09:28] get better and better and better and the
[00:09:30] gap between them and everyone else will
[00:09:32] just continue to widen so typical
[00:09:34] student when they repeatedly get bad
[00:09:36] results in an exam they will just get
[00:09:38] stressed they will hope that the next
[00:09:40] exam is better that certain questions
[00:09:42] are not going to be answered uh and then
[00:09:44] they're just going to try to study more
[00:09:46] they think I must not have studied
[00:09:48] enough for this exam next time I'm going
[00:09:50] to study more or in some cases they may
[00:09:53] try to copy success they'll look at what
[00:09:56] someone else that's doing well in their
[00:09:57] class is doing and they'll just try to
[00:09:59] add that on to what they're already
[00:10:01] doing with their studying and actually
[00:10:02] just giving themselves more work to do
[00:10:04] which kind of makes them even more
[00:10:05] stressed and if they're lucky the method
[00:10:08] they copied is going to help them and if
[00:10:10] they're not lucky then that method is
[00:10:12] not going to help them in fact it's
[00:10:13] going to be worse because now they're
[00:10:15] just doing more stuff that isn't
[00:10:18] effective on the other hand a top
[00:10:19] student is going to look at why they got
[00:10:22] that bad result and try to understand
[00:10:24] what is not working they're going to be
[00:10:26] focused on a cause and effect
[00:10:28] relationship the the cause is the
[00:10:30] processes and the methods they're using
[00:10:31] and the effect is the result that
[00:10:32] they're getting so what about their
[00:10:35] processes and methods is not leading
[00:10:37] them to get the result that they want
[00:10:39] are they redundant with some of the
[00:10:40] strategies that they're using are they
[00:10:42] missing a certain type of strategy are
[00:10:43] they not hitting the topic from a
[00:10:45] certain angle or not enough they're
[00:10:47] going to be thinking about the variables
[00:10:49] and trying to figure out why they're
[00:10:51] getting this bad result what the bad
[00:10:53] result means for their process and then
[00:10:55] changing the process and a lot of the
[00:10:58] time this means learning learning more
[00:11:00] about learning in order to make those
[00:11:02] informed decisions and for those of you
[00:11:04] that are interested I do have a
[00:11:05] step-by-step program where I distill the
[00:11:07] last decade of me looking at these
[00:11:09] patterns and packaging what works in a
[00:11:12] guided step-by-step program going
[00:11:14] through your note-taking skills and what
[00:11:16] you need to be thinking about and doing
[00:11:17] in class and lectures and how you should
[00:11:19] be studying after them how you should be
[00:11:21] revising how you should be using your
[00:11:22] inter leing a start to finish study
[00:11:25] system that is evidence-based and tried
[00:11:27] and tested you also have the opportunity
[00:11:29] for feedback so you can actually send
[00:11:30] through your work and then one of our
[00:11:31] coaches can have a look at it and
[00:11:32] actually tell you at an individualized
[00:11:34] level what you need to be doing with
[00:11:36] your studying to make it more efficient
[00:11:37] you can check that out at I insite.com
[00:11:39] the link is in the description scenario
[00:11:41] number two is if you're not confident
[00:11:43] before entering into an exam the typical
[00:11:45] student that's not confident before
[00:11:47] entering exam is going to respond in
[00:11:49] much the same way they're going to Hope
[00:11:50] certain questions don't come up and
[00:11:51] they're going to just study more do more
[00:11:54] questions do more past papers do more
[00:11:57] flash cards more hours at top learner
[00:12:00] understands that doing more doesn't
[00:12:01] necessarily translate into a better
[00:12:03] result so they're going to be much more
[00:12:04] focused and targeted with their time
[00:12:06] they're going to try to do more with
[00:12:08] less they'll think where are my gaps why
[00:12:11] am I not feeling confident what is the
[00:12:13] angle on testing myself that I have not
[00:12:15] looked at before what is actually
[00:12:17] missing so that the time that they do
[00:12:19] spend studying is really focused on
[00:12:22] those weaknesses that are preventing
[00:12:23] them from being confident rather than
[00:12:26] just hitting it again and again from the
[00:12:27] same way with the same method hoping
[00:12:29] that with repetition it getss better
[00:12:31] which normally it doesn't in scenario 3
[00:12:34] when you're feeling overwhelmed in
[00:12:36] lectures or just overwhelmed in general
[00:12:38] while you're studying like there's too
[00:12:39] much content like you're not remembering
[00:12:41] anything and like you know things are
[00:12:43] just slipping in this scenario a typical
[00:12:45] student is going to respond and I think
[00:12:47] you're going to see the pattern here
[00:12:48] they're either going to stop because
[00:12:50] they're too overwhelmed or they're going
[00:12:51] to overcompensate again just by doing
[00:12:54] more of the same you see the trend here
[00:12:57] whereas a top learner is going to think
[00:12:59] about why they are overwhelmed what are
[00:13:02] the things that are contributing to
[00:13:04] their overwhelm and they're going to
[00:13:05] make adjustments to their methods to see
[00:13:07] if that improves their overwhelm and So
[00:13:09] based on those scenarios you can see
[00:13:11] that a top student is not born a top
[00:13:14] student necessarily they had the
[00:13:16] characteristics and the attributes and
[00:13:18] the behaviors of someone who will one
[00:13:21] day be at the top 1% even before they
[00:13:25] were at the top 1% and so that is a
[00:13:27] point of reflection for you how have a
[00:13:29] look at your habits your reactions your
[00:13:32] responses your behaviors and your
[00:13:33] Tendencies and think are these the
[00:13:37] habits of someone who will one day be
[00:13:40] excellent or are these the habits of
[00:13:42] someone who will stay stuck or trapped
[00:13:45] and when we recognize that we may not
[00:13:47] have the prerequisites for being a top
[00:13:49] learner that's when the journey can
[00:13:51] really start thanks for watching and
[00:13:53] I'll see you next
[00:13:54] [Music]
[00:13:57] time


=== Good students understand this point ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdHvPpHV_U0

[00:00:00] so for the first thing about cramming
[00:00:01] the right way is to understand that
[00:00:03] you're in a compromised position anyway
[00:00:05] you're going to lose something and you
[00:00:07] have to be strategic about what you're
[00:00:08] going to lose if you haven't started
[00:00:10] studying for something 3 days before
[00:00:11] your exam and you're expecting to still
[00:00:13] do really well you're either a genius or
[00:00:16] you're delusional


=== Good students understand this idea ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNWi-Qgzia4

[00:00:00] most institutions in most countries are
[00:00:02] legally obligated to test you on the
[00:00:04] learning objectives now they don't have
[00:00:05] to test you on every single learning
[00:00:08] objective and what Falls within the
[00:00:10] scope of a learning objective can be
[00:00:12] quite a gray area sometimes but there's
[00:00:15] still a useful guide to work off and
[00:00:17] most examiners are going to think like
[00:00:19] this there's a list of learning
[00:00:20] objectives that they have for that
[00:00:22] particular subject let's say that there
[00:00:23] are three for one lecture and they're
[00:00:26] going to be thinking how can they test
[00:00:27] these learning objectives at these
[00:00:29] different levels of learning


=== You can learn anything it you go slowly enough ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wt0XHXwLxiU

[00:00:00] what is considered new and novel
[00:00:01] information depends on what you already
[00:00:03] know so if you're constantly building
[00:00:05] your prior knowledge in these small
[00:00:07] layers of just 1% at a time then every
[00:00:10] step is basically the same level of
[00:00:12] difficulty like I do not know anything
[00:00:13] about a resuscitative hysterotomy at all
[00:00:16] I actually like never even heard of that
[00:00:17] before honestly rather than saying it's
[00:00:19] not relevant to me but I'm just going to
[00:00:20] learn it now anyway and so the only way
[00:00:22] to do that is repeatedly smash it into
[00:00:24] my brain multiple times for you know
[00:00:27] days weeks sometimes years for it to
[00:00:29] finally stick and then by that point you
[00:00:30] don't even have to have memorized it
[00:00:32] because by that point you're like oh
[00:00:33] it's actually kind of obvious now


=== The #1 way students waste their time ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xpXmkDBBeo

[00:00:00] the mindset is often oh I need to spend
[00:00:02] longer so I'm going to take longer
[00:00:04] that's the wrong way it's I need to do
[00:00:06] it in this amount of time so you get it
[00:00:08] done what you end up skipping you skip
[00:00:10] that's the point the point is that you
[00:00:12] force yourself to skip certain things
[00:00:13] and really hone in on things that just
[00:00:15] build that overarching structure so that
[00:00:17] you're not getting bogged down by all
[00:00:18] the little details that are irrelevant
[00:00:19] and meaningless and purposeless for you
[00:00:21] to learn right now


=== Why K-Drama is better than medical school ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxUGglTkYRg

[00:00:00] this's this Korean Netflix show there's
[00:00:02] this medical student and one of their
[00:00:04] crew members are like they get injured
[00:00:06] and so this medical student has to
[00:00:08] operate on them in like their crdy
[00:00:09] shelter basement type thing and so what
[00:00:11] they do is they open up the anatomy
[00:00:13] textbooks and they just study like all
[00:00:15] night to try to figure out how they're
[00:00:16] going to operate on this person that is
[00:00:18] really great learning environment right
[00:00:19] so if you would to learn anatomy in the
[00:00:21] way that you're saying okay like how
[00:00:22] would I operate on this person then
[00:00:24] you're going to know that there's a
[00:00:25] blood vessel there because you're aware
[00:00:26] of the fact that you can't cut into it
[00:00:27] you know you know where you need to
[00:00:29] blunt dissect because you're afraid of
[00:00:30] vessels or or nervous Supply that's in
[00:00:32] that particular area you know the
[00:00:33] structure of the bones actually starts
[00:00:34] making sense because that's where you
[00:00:35] know you'd expect there to be more
[00:00:37] tension and the bone might displace in
[00:00:38] this direction or something like that
[00:00:39] there's always a context like there's a
[00:00:41] purpose for the knowledge but that
[00:00:42] purpose is completely removed normally
[00:00:44] what I'm saying is that purpose needs to
[00:00:45] be the first thing before even knowing
[00:00:48] about the insertion or the blood vessels
[00:00:49] or the supply or the pathology or the
[00:00:51] molecular structure or whatever before
[00:00:52] all of that is there we need to know why
[00:00:54] it's relevant the purpose behind it and
[00:00:56] then we're ready to learn


=== The trick to learning math is NOT the numbers ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id9y15qcQOY

[00:00:00] with math uh there's not that many
[00:00:01] Concepts not as much as something like
[00:00:03] biology or physics or chemistry or the
[00:00:05] Sciences or even something like politics
[00:00:06] or economics or things like that so it's
[00:00:08] actually very easy to do this entire
[00:00:10] process we've been talking about you
[00:00:11] just look at what you're being taught
[00:00:12] and you say well what's the purpose of
[00:00:13] it what's the big picture how can I
[00:00:15] apply it why is that actually important
[00:00:17] and how is that similar to these other
[00:00:18] things that I've learned how are they
[00:00:20] all related together and then you can
[00:00:21] group those things in a very similar way
[00:00:23] and now you've got okay so we've got
[00:00:24] these equations that you know generally
[00:00:26] allow me to do this there are these
[00:00:27] things that allow me to do this and
[00:00:28] they're related because you know this is
[00:00:30] the previous step or you know I need to
[00:00:32] do this to create this kind of variable
[00:00:34] so that I can actually use it in this
[00:00:35] kind of process and we get a really good
[00:00:37] conceptual understanding of it and then
[00:00:38] the rest is just procedural then you
[00:00:40] practice doing the equations you
[00:00:41] practice your questions you make sure
[00:00:43] that you're able to you know carry the
[00:00:44] three and you can apply the chain rule
[00:00:46] effectively and all those things


=== Learn math without the numbers first ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXS1cYfggO8

[00:00:00] you want to learn maths without the
[00:00:01] numbers first you want to have a
[00:00:03] conceptual understanding of math because
[00:00:05] understanding just like how you would
[00:00:07] understand it in biology or physics or
[00:00:08] chemistry or just like how you
[00:00:10] understand concepts for those subjects
[00:00:11] understanding concepts for math is
[00:00:13] equally important in fact it's even
[00:00:14] arguably more important because when you
[00:00:16] see a problem and it's not just like
[00:00:17] differentiate this you know or like find
[00:00:19] the area under the curve where it's just
[00:00:20] like simple Plug and Play when it's
[00:00:22] bringing it together in different
[00:00:23] context and now it's not just like
[00:00:25] numbers but it's like the velocity of
[00:00:26] this particular thing and like the you
[00:00:28] know force of gravity acting you know
[00:00:29] when there's multiple variables stacked
[00:00:31] on top of it what allows you to actually
[00:00:33] solve it is to conceptually understand
[00:00:36] how you can approach that in the first
[00:00:37] place and then what follows from that is
[00:00:39] knowing what the equations are but what
[00:00:40] a lot of people do is they look at Mass
[00:00:42] purely procedurally and they look at an
[00:00:43] isolation and so when they look at a
[00:00:45] problem what they're trying to do is
[00:00:46] just pattern recognition they're trying
[00:00:47] to say can I get the variables
[00:00:49] represented in here to fit into any of
[00:00:52] the equations that I know about


=== You need to study like you're sitting an exam ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koj3KoLHAyw

[00:00:00] if you want to be able to use your
[00:00:01] knowledge in a fluid way that allows you
[00:00:03] to bring multiple pieces of information
[00:00:05] together and retrieve it and with
[00:00:06] complexity and nuance and you're able to
[00:00:08] adapt that information if the situation
[00:00:10] or question changes you have to be
[00:00:12] thinking in that way as well when you're
[00:00:14] studying it you can't be thinking in a
[00:00:16] way that is isolated fragmented lowlevel
[00:00:18] memorization heavy and expect to just be
[00:00:21] able like it's not inherent just because
[00:00:23] you know each part in isolation doesn't
[00:00:24] mean you can actually bring it all
[00:00:25] together when you want to retrieve it at
[00:00:27] that level so you have to match the way
[00:00:28] you're studying with the way that you
[00:00:30] level that you want to retrieve it at


=== If you want to pass your exams, STOP TYPING ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kmkKD43jx0

[00:00:00] slower ability to get information on
[00:00:02] page with freehand ends up being
[00:00:04] advantageous because it forces you to be
[00:00:06] stricter with what you're actually
[00:00:07] choosing to write down which probably
[00:00:09] make means that you think about a little
[00:00:11] bit more as a rule of thumb I would say
[00:00:12] freehand if possible with the stylus
[00:00:15] something digital because knowledge does
[00:00:16] not exist mentally in A4 pages right so
[00:00:19] you know structuring something and
[00:00:20] spacing something in a certain way
[00:00:21] because that's how it fits on the page
[00:00:23] is going to be not a good reason to
[00:00:25] limit your learning quality so I
[00:00:27] personally my go-to is I'm always using
[00:00:29] infinite canvas app on I've personally
[00:00:31] got an iPad but you could use any
[00:00:32] basically any device that has got a Pen
[00:00:34] stylus that you can use for it again the
[00:00:35] focus is really on what am I thinking
[00:00:37] about and how aligned is that with what
[00:00:39] I'm writing


=== Creating the placebo effect is smart ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prhruKL_gjk

[00:00:00] there are lots of things that people
[00:00:01] will do because it makes them feel
[00:00:03] better they are creating the placebo
[00:00:04] effect for themselves and in some ways
[00:00:06] it's actually smart it's finding ways
[00:00:09] that you can tap into these powerful
[00:00:12] psychological effects that your mind is
[00:00:14] able to produce at the end of the day
[00:00:16] what matters is how you feel about it
[00:00:17] and the outcomes that you're getting


=== How important is sleep for performance ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pbNuEsZbI

[00:00:00] spending so many hours studying that you
[00:00:01] don't sleep is like spending all day
[00:00:03] trying to fill a bucket and then just
[00:00:05] before you go to sleep you drill a hole
[00:00:07] in the bottom of it sleep is also
[00:00:08] incredibly important for cognitive
[00:00:10] performance so when you're sleep
[00:00:11] deprived you are a slower less focused
[00:00:14] version of yourself and you usually
[00:00:16] won't even know it so now not only do
[00:00:19] you have a hole in the bottom of your
[00:00:20] bucket you have to fill that bucket
[00:00:22] during the day with only your feet and
[00:00:24] you normally don't even realize how
[00:00:27] impaired you are


=== Why learning faster can make you WORSE ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0Yk8PlCWY4

[00:00:00] did you know that trying to learn faster
[00:00:02] can actually make you worse at learning
[00:00:04] let me tell you the story back when I
[00:00:05] was finishing high school before I
[00:00:07] entered into uni I decided that speed
[00:00:10] reading was going to be the technique
[00:00:12] that's just going to change my life and
[00:00:13] so I did this like program and I learned
[00:00:15] to read a lot faster I went from like
[00:00:17] 300 words per minute to like over 1,000
[00:00:20] words per minute what I've realized and
[00:00:22] this is why I'm telling you the story is
[00:00:23] that learning to read faster was not my
[00:00:25] bottleneck but if I have 90%
[00:00:27] comprehension how is that possible it's
[00:00:29] because because that number is just like
[00:00:31] fake it's not real it's a number that's
[00:00:34] based on like a simple fact recall test
[00:00:36] that you're doing like 20 or 30 seconds
[00:00:38] after you read like a single isolated
[00:00:40] piece of text and that's when I realized
[00:00:41] that just doing the same thing that I
[00:00:43] was doing but faster isn't actually
[00:00:46] going to make me a better learner to be
[00:00:49] better I need to do something different
[00:00:52] not just the same thing and more of it
[00:00:54] and it's a lesson that took me an
[00:00:55] embarrassingly long amount of time to
[00:00:57] figure out

[00:00:00] and then finally we're ready for step
[00:00:01] five which is to then create the plan
[00:00:04] and this is focused on the immediate
[00:00:06] Next Step the idea is how do we use the
[00:00:08] resources at our disposal to overcome
[00:00:12] the barriers we have identified and help
[00:00:14] us incrementally slightly improve and
[00:00:17] develop closer to becoming that ideal
[00:00:20] person that we have already envisaged
[00:00:23] envisaged en envisaged
[00:00:28] envisioned thought oh

[00:00:00] stop trying to learn faster instead
[00:00:03] learn more efficiently and if you don't
[00:00:05] know the difference between those two
[00:00:07] things that might be why you are
[00:00:09] struggling to get the grades that you
[00:00:10] want there is so much productivity and
[00:00:13] studying advice out here on YouTube and
[00:00:15] I very rarely see anyone talking about
[00:00:18] the difference in this video I'm going
[00:00:20] to give you a very simple two-step
[00:00:22] framework to improve your grades by
[00:00:23] becoming a more efficient learner rather
[00:00:26] than a faster learner and at the end of
[00:00:28] the video I'll give you my Golden Rule
[00:00:31] on when you should definitely not try to
[00:00:34] get faster if you are new to this
[00:00:36] channel welcome I'm Dr Justin Sun I'm a
[00:00:38] full-time learning coach in the head of
[00:00:39] learning at ien study I'm also a former
[00:00:41] medical doctor and for the last decade I
[00:00:43] have worked with thousands of Learners
[00:00:45] from around the world to help them learn
[00:00:47] more efficiently so let's start with why
[00:00:49] trying to be a fast learner can actually
[00:00:51] make you worse at learning one of the
[00:00:53] first things that I started learning
[00:00:54] back when I was in high school uh
[00:00:55] entering into uni was speed reading and
[00:00:58] my thinking was very very simple if I I
[00:01:00] can read at like 300 words per minute
[00:01:02] right now if I can double that to 600
[00:01:05] then I have doubled my learning speed
[00:01:08] and so I installed this app uh on
[00:01:10] Windows that taught me all these things
[00:01:12] like sub vocalization and the grouping
[00:01:13] and the skimming and like eye training
[00:01:15] drills and after about a month of
[00:01:17] training like an hour or so a couple
[00:01:19] hours every day I managed to get my
[00:01:21] words per minute up to like over a th000
[00:01:24] with 90% retention and comprehension and
[00:01:27] so I thought damn I'm unstoppable now
[00:01:30] now about 2 months later I started my
[00:01:32] first year of uni which was the
[00:01:33] competitive premade year to enter into
[00:01:35] medical school and as many of you know
[00:01:37] how that story played out if you've
[00:01:38] watched my other videos I had to study a
[00:01:41] lot like I was studying my crazy 20
[00:01:44] hours a day 7 days a week and so one
[00:01:46] thing I realized which is very obvious
[00:01:48] to me now is that learning to read
[00:01:50] faster didn't really improve my learning
[00:01:53] speed by that much by tripling my
[00:01:56] reading speed my actual learning speed
[00:01:59] probably only increased by like 5% and
[00:02:02] that's because even though I technically
[00:02:04] had a high retention and comprehension
[00:02:07] like over 90% it's not real it was based
[00:02:11] on these simple fact recall assessments
[00:02:14] that were done like 30 seconds after I'd
[00:02:16] finished reading a very isolated passage
[00:02:19] of text and none of that is realistic in
[00:02:22] reality we're reading large volumes of
[00:02:24] information over hours and we need to
[00:02:26] use that information Beyond just simple
[00:02:28] fact recall and we need to retain it not
[00:02:31] just for like 30 seconds but for days or
[00:02:33] even weeks and so my bottleneck was not
[00:02:35] in how fast I could read and consume
[00:02:38] information it was how I was processing
[00:02:41] the information in my brain once I had
[00:02:43] consumed it all I'd done by increasing
[00:02:45] my reading speed was make it so that I
[00:02:47] was trying to drink out of a fire hose
[00:02:50] and here's why the story is relevant to
[00:02:51] you even though reading speed is the
[00:02:54] technique that I was working on this
[00:02:55] would have been the same for any other
[00:02:57] technique fundamentally the the problem
[00:03:00] was that I believed that I could get
[00:03:02] better by doing the same thing but
[00:03:06] faster knowing what I know now about how
[00:03:08] Learning Works that is completely flawed
[00:03:10] in fact it's actually worse than flawed
[00:03:11] it's actually harmful it's harmful
[00:03:13] because it takes away your focus on
[00:03:15] working on things that would have
[00:03:16] actually made a bigger difference it
[00:03:17] entrenches existing habits that aren't
[00:03:20] really serving you anymore and it
[00:03:21] increases the errors that you make and
[00:03:24] those errors in your learning you then
[00:03:26] have to spend more time to just fix them
[00:03:27] later and the problem with just trying
[00:03:29] to study faster using the same method
[00:03:32] becomes really obvious when you think
[00:03:33] about it like this do you actively try
[00:03:36] to think more slowly normally like are
[00:03:40] you deliberately studying there and
[00:03:42] being like today I'm just going to hit a
[00:03:44] casual 60% like I know I could think
[00:03:47] about this faster I know I could just
[00:03:50] process the information better but today
[00:03:52] I'm just going to take it easy and only
[00:03:54] work at like half my capacity most
[00:03:56] people most of the time are thinking at
[00:03:58] a speed they that is fairly Optimum for
[00:04:01] what they can do with that method
[00:04:03] without increasing errors so whether it
[00:04:06] is reading or it is the way that we are
[00:04:08] writing notes or typing notes or
[00:04:10] whatever it is the problem is not how
[00:04:11] fast we are doing it it is just how we
[00:04:14] are doing it if the machine is broken
[00:04:17] when you crank up the machine to make it
[00:04:19] faster you're just increasing more
[00:04:21] errors that you got to fix later and I
[00:04:23] see a really common example of this with
[00:04:24] like AI these days where people are like
[00:04:26] hey you can use this app to you know it
[00:04:28] like types out all of your notes for you
[00:04:30] you just take the recording from a
[00:04:31] lecture and it just pumps out like
[00:04:33] magically these notes you're done your
[00:04:34] studying is done you don't have to study
[00:04:36] ever again you're going to be amazing
[00:04:37] like yeah you've got notes but it
[00:04:39] doesn't mean you learned anything and
[00:04:41] people like Rave about these apps
[00:04:42] they're like oh it saves me so much time
[00:04:45] that's the equivalent of like a robot
[00:04:47] that says they're going to go work out
[00:04:49] for you and now you're like oh I've
[00:04:50] saved so much time because I don't have
[00:04:52] to waste time at the gym anymore my
[00:04:54] robot is lifting the weights for me it's
[00:04:56] like congratulations you won the prize
[00:04:58] for missing the the point and that is
[00:05:01] exactly the type of thinking that I had
[00:05:04] when I was going through uni for the
[00:05:05] first few years I was just focused on
[00:05:07] like speed just being faster just saving
[00:05:10] time that's all that mattered which is
[00:05:12] why it's no wonder that by the end of
[00:05:14] like literally my first month of
[00:05:16] University I was already starting to
[00:05:18] feel overwhelmed and like the more I
[00:05:20] tried the more I was falling behind I
[00:05:22] could just never keep up and despite
[00:05:23] like studying even more to make up for
[00:05:26] that which is ironic I still wasn't
[00:05:28] walking into the exam feeling confident
[00:05:30] so if that sounds like you then this is
[00:05:33] what you should do this is what I wish I
[00:05:35] had done a lot earlier actually measure
[00:05:38] your retention and understanding
[00:05:40] properly do this don't worry so much
[00:05:42] about how long it takes to study
[00:05:45] something pick something study it for 2
[00:05:47] or 3 hours use whatever method you feel
[00:05:50] like comfortable with and at the end of
[00:05:52] the session create a little test for
[00:05:54] yourself 15 questions five of these
[00:05:57] questions should be lowlevel Factory
[00:05:59] call definitions explaining processes
[00:06:02] and Concepts isolated five of these
[00:06:04] questions should be midlevel applying it
[00:06:07] to a simple problem to solve or
[00:06:10] combining two concepts together to see
[00:06:12] how they're related to each other like
[00:06:14] how does one thing affect this other
[00:06:15] thing and five of them should be high
[00:06:18] level these are usually going to be like
[00:06:19] short answer or like mini essay type
[00:06:21] questions where you're taking at least
[00:06:23] three different concepts and you're
[00:06:25] saying yes they're related to each other
[00:06:28] explain why they're how they're related
[00:06:29] but also let's talk about the impact or
[00:06:32] the significance of that relationship if
[00:06:35] you change one thing how does it affect
[00:06:37] everything else so now You' got 15 like
[00:06:39] test questions that you've made yourself
[00:06:40] one week later test your attention and
[00:06:43] understanding by doing that test do it
[00:06:46] purely based on memory do not review
[00:06:48] your notes beforehand since you're
[00:06:49] probably not going to have an answer
[00:06:50] sheet for this you can check whether
[00:06:52] your answers make sense at the end of
[00:06:54] the test by looking at your notes
[00:06:56] looking things up asking someone asking
[00:06:58] a teacher asking a lecture for the high
[00:07:00] level questions you're not really going
[00:07:01] to know whether it was like a correct
[00:07:03] answer or not but you'll generally get a
[00:07:06] sense for whether it made sense and
[00:07:07] whether it was like a good answer or you
[00:07:09] missed a few things as you're exploring
[00:07:11] and learning more about the topic now
[00:07:13] that in itself is actually a very very
[00:07:16] effective and Powerful revision
[00:07:18] technique and once you do it you're
[00:07:20] probably going to start doing it
[00:07:21] regularly like forever because it's just
[00:07:23] so good even without the answer sheet
[00:07:25] like trying to figure out if you got the
[00:07:27] right answer is incredibly beneficial
[00:07:29] learning but the added benefit is that
[00:07:31] it gives you a accurate representation
[00:07:34] of how good your methods really are
[00:07:36] you'll be able to see the retention you
[00:07:38] have for low level midlevel and higher
[00:07:41] level and you'll be able to see your
[00:07:42] ability to actually tackle those
[00:07:44] different levels of questions generally
[00:07:46] speaking if you get over 90% I'd say
[00:07:48] that's great that's really really good
[00:07:50] 80% and over still pretty good 70% and
[00:07:53] over it's acceptable less than 70%
[00:07:57] probably something in your methods can
[00:07:59] be optimized it doesn't mean that
[00:08:01] everything that you're doing is bad it
[00:08:02] just means that there are some parts of
[00:08:03] the way that you're studying that aren't
[00:08:05] really serving you anymore for this type
[00:08:07] of content for that level of Challenge
[00:08:09] and so now we have some real data on how
[00:08:12] effective our learning methods actually
[00:08:14] are and you might find that it's better
[00:08:16] for some subjects and worse for other
[00:08:18] subjects but when you continue to do
[00:08:19] this you get a really good idea about
[00:08:21] whether your methods are actually
[00:08:22] serving you or not armed with this data
[00:08:24] we can then move on to step two of the
[00:08:27] framework so just to reiterate the
[00:08:29] problem with step one was thinking that
[00:08:30] we can get better just by doing the same
[00:08:33] thing but faster and the second problem
[00:08:35] is that trying to learn faster often
[00:08:38] makes us skip the part of learning that
[00:08:40] is the most beneficial while spending
[00:08:43] more time on the thing that doesn't help
[00:08:46] it reduces the value you're getting for
[00:08:50] the time that you're spending it
[00:08:51] actually lowers your efficiency and
[00:08:53] instead of just explaining it to you
[00:08:54] myself here's an email that I recently
[00:08:56] got that explains it perfectly I I kid
[00:08:59] you not I received this email literally
[00:09:02] yesterday morning while I was planning
[00:09:04] this video so here it is as you can see
[00:09:06] it's a little long uh but if we focus in
[00:09:09] on this sentence I think it sums it up
[00:09:11] perfectly where it says I realized I was
[00:09:13] so fixated on trying to finish all my
[00:09:15] content as quickly as possible and I was
[00:09:17] avoiding actually processing the parts
[00:09:19] of the topic I felt were difficult and
[00:09:22] then later on they went on to say they
[00:09:24] they triy to push through and they
[00:09:26] thought about it patiently like a
[00:09:27] detective trying to so overc case
[00:09:29] instead of a chore that I had to do and
[00:09:32] I really like the way that they put it
[00:09:34] fact I might use that analogy in the
[00:09:35] future a lot of the time when we're
[00:09:36] focused on trying to go faster and I
[00:09:38] felt this a lot is that anything that
[00:09:40] makes us slow down is perceived as bad
[00:09:44] it feels like it's making us less
[00:09:46] efficient but actually the the reality
[00:09:48] is that real efficiency is about knowing
[00:09:51] when it's worth slowing down it's
[00:09:55] understanding that sometimes you
[00:09:56] actually have to let your brain sit and
[00:09:58] think think about it and the reason I
[00:10:00] like that detective analogy is because a
[00:10:01] detective's job is to solve the case
[00:10:04] they're looking at these Clues and
[00:10:06] they're trying to piece the puzzle
[00:10:08] together and figure it out that's their
[00:10:10] job they're not thinking about it like
[00:10:12] oh yep I looked at the clues yep I tried
[00:10:15] my best I couldn't really figure
[00:10:17] anything out couldn't solve the case but
[00:10:19] that's that toas picked off the list
[00:10:21] oops couldn't catch the criminal bit of
[00:10:22] luck next time that's not how they're
[00:10:24] doing it probably I hope there's a
[00:10:26] commitment to figuring it out they are
[00:10:29] determined to see the pattern even when
[00:10:33] it's not obvious and that takes time you
[00:10:36] can't just rush your brain to see that
[00:10:39] pattern just by like forcing it to like
[00:10:41] see patterns harder like I'm pretty sure
[00:10:44] cases don't get solved like in animes
[00:10:45] where you know like the detective is
[00:10:47] like what's the missing clue like what's
[00:10:49] the solution and then someone's like
[00:10:50] think about it we're running out of time
[00:10:52] think harder and they have this like
[00:10:54] flashback Montage of all these things
[00:10:56] that they saw over the last few months
[00:10:58] like the woman's ring she was wearing it
[00:11:00] on her left hand the door it had a
[00:11:02] smudge on the left side of the door knob
[00:11:04] the gun it was angled 15° clockwise the
[00:11:08] pieces they're connecting together oh I
[00:11:09] know the solution like I don't think
[00:11:11] that that happens you know those scenes
[00:11:13] that I'm talking about that's literally
[00:11:15] never ever happened to me in my entire
[00:11:18] life no in in real life learning
[00:11:21] requires making connections and deciding
[00:11:24] which connections are worth keeping and
[00:11:26] which ones are not as important that all
[00:11:28] takes time and just patience and because
[00:11:31] that takes time if you try to rush it
[00:11:34] you're actually going to miss out on
[00:11:35] making those connections that directly
[00:11:38] create better memory and understanding
[00:11:41] aka the actual learning is being skipped
[00:11:44] and what we end up doing is we spend
[00:11:45] more time on just consuming information
[00:11:48] and maybe documenting information and
[00:11:50] less time on actually learning it in the
[00:11:53] first place on the other hand if you
[00:11:55] know which parts are worth slowing down
[00:11:57] for the value you get per hour you spend
[00:12:01] increases your efficiency actually
[00:12:03] improves by strategically slowing down
[00:12:07] you get slower at covering content and
[00:12:10] reading words but you get faster at
[00:12:13] building knowledge see the difference so
[00:12:15] after you did step one here's what you
[00:12:18] can do with step two start by watching
[00:12:20] another one of my videos and this is not
[00:12:23] like just one of those sneaky kind of
[00:12:25] like like this video like plug type
[00:12:27] things I'm I'm actually serious yeah I
[00:12:29] appreciate the extra views but I have a
[00:12:31] lot of other videos where I talk about
[00:12:32] different techniques and most of the
[00:12:34] time I'm creating those videos with an
[00:12:36] audience in mind that doesn't have a lot
[00:12:38] of like training and and like Advanced
[00:12:40] learning strategies like these are
[00:12:41] things that I think most people can kind
[00:12:43] of pick up and start running with so
[00:12:45] watch a a video if you want one to start
[00:12:48] with I think the nonlinear note taking
[00:12:49] video is probably a good place to start
[00:12:51] I'll put a link to that in the
[00:12:52] description and try to integrate that
[00:12:54] into your method you don't have to like
[00:12:56] change everything even if you just take
[00:12:58] a few parts of it and then integrate it
[00:13:01] and change your method just whatever is
[00:13:03] comfortable for you study the same thing
[00:13:05] again another two or three hours and do
[00:13:07] the same process test yourself and after
[00:13:09] you do this a few rounds you'll start
[00:13:11] noticing how making small changes in
[00:13:13] your methods affects your attention and
[00:13:16] your understanding and you'll realize
[00:13:18] how by changing how you are going about
[00:13:20] learning you can increase your overall
[00:13:23] efficiency not by being faster but by
[00:13:25] getting more out of the time that you're
[00:13:27] putting in which brings me to my Golden
[00:13:29] Rule that I promised you at the
[00:13:31] beginning if you feel like you need to
[00:13:34] study faster to keep up it almost always
[00:13:38] means you really need to figure out
[00:13:40] where to slow down feeling like you need
[00:13:43] to speed up probably means that you are
[00:13:45] falling behind it means that what you're
[00:13:47] doing now isn't enough in other words
[00:13:50] this is a sign that your current methods
[00:13:52] are leaking effort and time and
[00:13:54] therefore you're not getting enough
[00:13:55] value out of the time that you are
[00:13:56] currently spending and so it's true it's
[00:13:59] not about spending more time if you've
[00:14:01] got limited time but the answer isn't
[00:14:03] getting faster it's figuring out which
[00:14:06] parts are wasting and leaking time
[00:14:08] remember doing the same thing but faster
[00:14:11] only amplifies your errors which is
[00:14:13] actually going to make you more stressed
[00:14:15] which may be something that you have
[00:14:18] directly felt multiple times where you
[00:14:20] felt like what you weren't doing right
[00:14:22] now was enough and then you tried to be
[00:14:24] faster or you did more of it and you
[00:14:25] actually ended up with more problems to
[00:14:27] deal with more stress more anxiety more
[00:14:30] uncertainty if you feel the need for
[00:14:33] speed the answer is to keep making
[00:14:35] changes to your methods until that
[00:14:38] feeling goes away and this can take a
[00:14:41] little bit of time some people might be
[00:14:42] hesitant about spending time when they
[00:14:45] feel like they're running out of time
[00:14:47] but trust me just trying to go faster is
[00:14:49] a dead end it's a dead end that I have
[00:14:52] gone down many many many times before
[00:14:55] and I can tell you there's nothing
[00:14:57] waiting there for you like at the end of
[00:14:59] that you're going to have to do a U-turn
[00:15:00] and get back out again anyway now for me
[00:15:03] the way that I learn now I feel mentally
[00:15:06] much less rushed than I used to feel
[00:15:08] when I was in my like first year of
[00:15:10] University and my learning efficiency is
[00:15:12] like three four times greater than it
[00:15:15] was back then I know what I need to do I
[00:15:18] I have a systematic way of building
[00:15:21] knowledge and I know exactly what I'm
[00:15:22] going to get out of the time that I'm
[00:15:24] spending it gives me a lot of confidence
[00:15:25] it gives me a lot of control for me it
[00:15:27] took me years to get to this point and
[00:15:28] but hopefully by sharing some of the
[00:15:30] things that I've learned along the way
[00:15:31] it's going to take a little less time
[00:15:32] for you now if you do want to head start
[00:15:34] on this to figure it out a little bit
[00:15:36] more easily then you may be interested

[00:16:07] time


=== Think like a detective when studying ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LnQuT65pWg

[00:00:00] when you study try to think like a
[00:00:02] detective a detective has Clues and
[00:00:05] they're looking for patterns even if
[00:00:07] they're not obvious a detective is
[00:00:09] committed to figuring it out and that's
[00:00:11] exactly the same mindset that you should
[00:00:13] have when you are learning there are
[00:00:14] pieces of information there's a pattern
[00:00:16] there that you need to try to figure out
[00:00:18] and that pattern is not always obvious
[00:00:20] and the way that it's taught to you may
[00:00:22] not show that pattern and the pattern
[00:00:23] you find might not necessarily be the
[00:00:26] same as the pattern that your friend
[00:00:28] finds but as long as it makes sense to
[00:00:30] you it's valid and that's what helps us
[00:00:32] learn the problem is that a lot of the
[00:00:35] time Learners are very time oriented and
[00:00:38] so they think man it's taking me so long
[00:00:39] to see the pattern and by doing so
[00:00:41] they're actually skipping the part of
[00:00:43] learning that is building stronger
[00:00:44] memory and stronger understanding and so
[00:00:46] what's necessary to actually do proper
[00:00:48] learning is actually a commitment to
[00:00:51] figuring it out and finding the pattern
[00:00:53] even when it's hard to and that is what
[00:00:56] distinguishes a great learner from an
[00:00:59] average one


=== How to check your learning efficiency ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR-lqol3IR0

[00:00:00] how efficient is your learning ability
[00:00:01] and I don't mean just like a general
[00:00:03] vague feeling I mean objectively here's
[00:00:06] what you can do take a topic and study
[00:00:07] it for 2 or 3 hours using whatever
[00:00:10] method you feel comfortable with just
[00:00:11] like your normal method of studying and
[00:00:13] then after this create a mini test for
[00:00:16] yourself with 15 questions five of these
[00:00:19] questions should be on just basic
[00:00:21] low-level fact recall definition
[00:00:24] explaining a process five of them should
[00:00:26] be midlevel where you relate two
[00:00:28] concepts to each other and say okay well
[00:00:31] how is this thing related to this thing
[00:00:33] and then five questions should be on the
[00:00:34] high level this is when you take at
[00:00:36] least three different concepts and you
[00:00:39] say yes they're related explain how
[00:00:42] they're related and also the
[00:00:43] significance of that relationship and
[00:00:46] then do this test a week later purely
[00:00:49] from memory without looking at your
[00:00:51] notes and this will give you a quick and
[00:00:53] dirty assessment of your retention and
[00:00:55] ability to use your knowledge at each of
[00:00:58] the levels


=== Stop scheduling like a child ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_6gPxdKxJs

[00:00:00] overestimating how long something takes
[00:00:02] is not a big problem when you
[00:00:04] underestimate and then it takes you
[00:00:06] longer than you expected it makes it
[00:00:08] difficult because now you have to go
[00:00:09] back and rearrange your tasks and
[00:00:11] priorities and reschedule things it
[00:00:13] actually switches you out of the flow of
[00:00:15] the day and it makes you spend more time
[00:00:17] and effort and attention on shuffling
[00:00:18] things around and also places more
[00:00:20] stress on you as well if you
[00:00:22] overestimate and you finish earlier than
[00:00:24] you expected well now you've just got
[00:00:25] more free time that you can use however
[00:00:27] you want and what I found was that
[00:00:29] trying to be ious with how long a task
[00:00:31] would take me was not actually worth it
[00:00:33] to squeeze out an extra 30 minutes or
[00:00:36] even even a couple hours of extra
[00:00:38] productivity and ended up being much
[00:00:40] better to plan for the worst and hit out
[00:00:43] a few of the smaller tasks if I did
[00:00:45] manage to finish some things earlier and
[00:00:47] I had a unexpected Gap


=== Toxic productivity is NOT cool ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xyi2Ul5XgZk

[00:00:00] you definitely don't need to be studying
[00:00:02] 120 hours a week to enter into Medical
[00:00:04] School unless you have no idea what
[00:00:05] you're doing like me do not recommend
[00:00:09] working and studying as much as I did it
[00:00:12] is not a better or a cooler way to live
[00:00:15] I think in today's culture it is
[00:00:17] incredibly admirable to say no I don't
[00:00:20] want to buy into the whole hustle
[00:00:22] mentality if you don't want to be that
[00:00:24] busy then there is absolutely nothing
[00:00:27] wrong with that I completely disagree
[00:00:29] with toxic productivity where you're
[00:00:31] just being busy and productive for the
[00:00:33] sake of it just because you're not
[00:00:34] working and studying so much that you
[00:00:36] pee blood it doesn't make you a more
[00:00:38] inferior person


=== What can you do if you do not want to compromise on sleep? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0mVzmYQSQU

[00:00:00] so if we don't compromise on sleep which
[00:00:02] is a smart thing to do then this is what
[00:00:04] would happen we'd have this huge list of
[00:00:06] things to do and then we'd put them on
[00:00:07] the schedule but because we need to
[00:00:09] sleep we wouldn't get it all done so how
[00:00:12] do we win it seems on one hand we either
[00:00:15] compromise on sleep and we lose or on
[00:00:18] the other hand we don't get everything
[00:00:19] done and we lose the trick here is to
[00:00:22] pick your losses it is true you're going
[00:00:25] to lose in one way but sometimes we have
[00:00:28] to lose the game to win the champion
[00:00:30] ship if we lose on sleep we lose on a
[00:00:33] lot of things it's like winning the game
[00:00:35] but then your whole team is hospitalized
[00:00:37] afterwards if we lose on not getting
[00:00:40] everything done that day we can still
[00:00:42] recover from that


=== Mind map is your mind mirror ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1w9vtTkhOE

[00:00:00] so I tried mind mapping one time and I
[00:00:01] found that it was kind of a waste of
[00:00:03] time I didn't really do anything with it
[00:00:05] for like years and then I tried it again
[00:00:08] when I was in medical school and it
[00:00:09] changed everything I used to think my
[00:00:11] mapping was just about like putting some
[00:00:13] things down and then uh drawing some
[00:00:15] lines and arrows and arranging a few
[00:00:17] things and that was kind of it like I
[00:00:19] just thought about it like normal note
[00:00:20] taking but that is completely not it and
[00:00:23] if you do it that way you're going to
[00:00:24] find that it's useless the trick is
[00:00:25] actually to turn it into a mind mirror
[00:00:28] first you want to cut down as much as
[00:00:30] you can how wordy it is and then you
[00:00:32] want to only write down the things that
[00:00:34] you think are important enough and you
[00:00:36] want to arrange it in a way that you
[00:00:37] feel like actually makes sense that
[00:00:39] takes actually a lot of thinking so if
[00:00:41] you're mind mapping but you're finding
[00:00:42] that it doesn't require a lot of
[00:00:44] thinking then it probably means that
[00:00:45] you're not using the right technique and
[00:00:47] when what you write actually becomes a
[00:00:48] reflection of how you've been thinking
[00:00:50] about it it means you can literally
[00:00:52] visually see where there are errors in
[00:00:54] your knowledge which makes your revision
[00:00:57] way easier


=== The importance of sleep in my 100-hour work week ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTZfyLY112w

[00:00:00] you also can't really train yourself to
[00:00:01] sleep less there's been a lot of
[00:00:03] research over the years around different
[00:00:05] sleep timings and the research
[00:00:06] consistently Trends towards the idea
[00:00:09] that you have to get a continuous 7 to 9
[00:00:12] hours of sleep to function properly and
[00:00:14] very very few people can do with less
[00:00:17] than that I personally need 8 and 1 half
[00:00:19] to 9 hours of sleep per night which is
[00:00:21] on the higher side and actually it took
[00:00:23] me some years to accept that the only
[00:00:25] thing that really does seem to reduce
[00:00:27] your sleep requirement is actually age
[00:00:29] when people get older they do require
[00:00:31] less sleep but we're talking about when
[00:00:32] you're in your 50s 607s ' 80s you maybe
[00:00:35] can do with less sleep


=== The benefits of being lazy ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hR6Edwn0hs

[00:00:00] ever since I moved to using a Macbook
[00:00:02] instead of a my old Windows PC I
[00:00:05] basically stopped gaming on my computer
[00:00:07] altogether I just couldn't be bothered
[00:00:09] unplugging my MacBook and then plugging
[00:00:10] my computer in and like connecting up to
[00:00:12] the Monitor and everything and then
[00:00:13] turning it on just to play some games so
[00:00:14] I stopped I effectively became too lazy
[00:00:18] to procrastinate think about that


=== Stop trying to copy the best students ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6J9MziSXpE

[00:00:00] most high Achievers are also not
[00:00:01] experienced learning coaches so what
[00:00:04] worked for them doesn't necessarily
[00:00:06] transfer to someone else this is one of
[00:00:08] the reasons why I always say take advice
[00:00:09] from people that have had personal
[00:00:11] success and have been able to replicate
[00:00:13] that success in other people again just
[00:00:15] because you are a terrific athlete
[00:00:17] doesn't necessarily mean that you're a
[00:00:18] good coach


=== Can you learn to be a genius? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmO8QOg1YOY

[00:00:00] think of a genius that you know or have
[00:00:02] heard of what you are thinking about is
[00:00:04] probably deep processing deep processing
[00:00:06] is the ability to think critically make
[00:00:09] connections between ideas extract
[00:00:11] meaningful learning from information and
[00:00:14] understand complex Concepts most people
[00:00:15] with deep processing are high Achievers
[00:00:18] and they have high deep processing
[00:00:20] because of a combination of genetics and
[00:00:22] childhood experiences here's the
[00:00:24] important part of deep processing though
[00:00:25] deep processing can be trained your
[00:00:28] brain has this thing called neuroplastic
[00:00:30] which is the ability for it to mold and
[00:00:31] adapt based on the pressures that you
[00:00:33] put on it that's how we form new habits
[00:00:35] deep processing is just a series of
[00:00:38] habits related to learning and they can
[00:00:40] be trained not every person is going to
[00:00:42] become the genius but everyone can get
[00:00:45] better


=== What study advice should you follow? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9uaXRPv-pk

[00:00:00] people with high deep processing can use
[00:00:02] ineffective techniques and still do well
[00:00:05] this single fact is the reason why there
[00:00:08] is so much bad studying advice out there
[00:00:12] their raw processing power can
[00:00:14] compensate for their bad technique High
[00:00:17] deep processors don't need to use the
[00:00:20] most effective techniques a lot of the
[00:00:21] time especially when they're in high
[00:00:23] school or things are a little bit easier
[00:00:24] most natural high Achievers are doing
[00:00:27] well despite their techniques not
[00:00:30] because of them


=== After 5000 Hours of Mind Mapping, Here's What I've Learned... ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqxUExCZJ5Y

[00:00:00] I've made over 300 mind maps here's one
[00:00:03] of my first mind maps which is about
[00:00:05] half a Page worth of normal linear notes
[00:00:07] and here's a more recent one that I made
[00:00:08] for my masters which is equivalent to
[00:00:11] almost 100 pages of notes in this video
[00:00:13] I'm going to give you four secrets of
[00:00:15] effective mind mapping that took me over
[00:00:17] a decade to figure out and make sure to
[00:00:19] stick around to the end of the video
[00:00:20] because I'll explain how you can
[00:00:21] integrate the famous Fineman technique
[00:00:24] into your mind mapping to make it the
[00:00:26] most powerful learning tool you have in
[00:00:28] your aome so secret number one turn your
[00:00:32] mind maps into a mind mirror let me
[00:00:35] explain when I first started mind
[00:00:37] mapping I used to just treat it like
[00:00:39] normal note taking I read some stuff I
[00:00:42] listen to some stuff and then I just try
[00:00:43] to put it down onto my map I'm
[00:00:45] simplifying a few words I'm paraphrasing
[00:00:48] I'm shortening and abbreviating I'm
[00:00:49] adding some lines and arrows and places
[00:00:51] where I think things are connected and I
[00:00:53] thought that was pretty much it to my
[00:00:55] mapping pretty easy pretty useless I
[00:00:58] honestly didn't find find it very
[00:01:00] effective so I actually kind of stopped
[00:01:02] my mapping for a few years and then when
[00:01:04] I entered into medical school one of my
[00:01:06] friends in a lecture I noticed that they
[00:01:09] were mapping during a lecture and they
[00:01:11] said that they were finding it really
[00:01:12] effective and really useful and at this
[00:01:13] point I was like falling asleep in
[00:01:15] pretty much every lecture anyway so I
[00:01:16] was willing to give anything a go and
[00:01:18] this is also the point at which I was
[00:01:20] like really really heavily into just
[00:01:21] doing like lots and lots of flash cards
[00:01:23] and I was really seeing to start how
[00:01:25] overwhelming it can be and I was like
[00:01:27] trapped in this never ending flash card
[00:01:29] cycle so in the next lecture I decided
[00:01:31] to just try mapping it out instead so no
[00:01:34] more lecture slides that I'm annotating
[00:01:36] on no more ever note or one note or just
[00:01:40] like typing things out as I went it was
[00:01:42] kind of weird because I felt almost like
[00:01:44] naked it was just me my brain the
[00:01:48] lecture and a blank piece of paper it
[00:01:51] felt like all my my gear all my tools
[00:01:53] were like Stripped Away From Me and in
[00:01:56] the hindsight I think this really helped
[00:01:58] me because i' be sitting sitting there
[00:02:00] in the lecture and I'd be trying to
[00:02:01] create this myet but because the
[00:02:03] lecturer didn't really make it a
[00:02:06] priority to make the lecture more easily
[00:02:09] understandable I just didn't have time
[00:02:12] to write down absolutely everything like
[00:02:15] I was kind of more used to so I started
[00:02:16] cutting down the words that I was using
[00:02:18] to just the key words and I spent more
[00:02:21] time thinking about what is actually
[00:02:23] worth writing down and what is important
[00:02:26] enough that I want to write it down in
[00:02:27] the way that is the most efficient way
[00:02:30] possible and that's when I realized
[00:02:31] first of all how powerful a simple arrow
[00:02:34] can be at representing actually quite a
[00:02:37] complex relationship and also how with
[00:02:40] my previous notes a lot of the words I
[00:02:42] was writing weren't really helping my
[00:02:45] learning of it anyway in fact with less
[00:02:47] words it was getting easier because
[00:02:49] there were less things on the page for
[00:02:51] my brain to try to process through it
[00:02:54] meant that I could spend more time
[00:02:55] actually thinking about the ideas and
[00:02:57] how they connect together and less time
[00:02:59] just trying to read everything on the
[00:03:01] page and so even though it was actually
[00:03:03] a lot harder initially it got much much
[00:03:07] easier doing it this way than with my
[00:03:08] old technique and I would leave the
[00:03:10] lecture feeling like okay I actually
[00:03:13] understood most of the things they were
[00:03:15] explaining and for the first time I had
[00:03:17] you know like more questions I was able
[00:03:19] to think about a lot more deeply when I
[00:03:21] went to study I kind of had an
[00:03:24] understanding about which parts I needed
[00:03:25] to revise more versus which parts you
[00:03:27] know were relatively strong I had more
[00:03:29] of a clear Direction whereas before I
[00:03:31] would leave the lecture just being like
[00:03:33] well I'm going to have to study all of
[00:03:34] that all over again like pretty much all
[00:03:36] I did is attend the lecture and I would
[00:03:39] be you know like even more overwhelmed
[00:03:41] after the lecture than beforehand and
[00:03:42] also just like really tired despite the
[00:03:44] fact that I spent half the lecture
[00:03:46] sleeping so what does this all have to
[00:03:47] do with this concept of like a mind
[00:03:49] mirror well one of the things that I
[00:03:51] started realizing very early on was that
[00:03:53] because I was thinking so much about how
[00:03:55] to write it down in a way that actually
[00:03:57] makes sense the notes that I would was
[00:04:00] producing reflected my mind much more
[00:04:04] closely and so I could start visually
[00:04:07] seeing where there were gaps in my
[00:04:09] knowledge and where I struggled with if
[00:04:12] there was a problem on the map there was
[00:04:14] a corresponding problem in my mind in my
[00:04:17] own memory if it looked really messy and
[00:04:21] chaotic then that meant that it was also
[00:04:23] pretty messy in my brain too for example
[00:04:25] if you have a look at this map that I
[00:04:27] did relatively early on you can see that
[00:04:29] there are these parts here which look
[00:04:31] really really messy and yes all these
[00:04:33] ideas are connected to each other but if
[00:04:35] someone actually ask me to explain it
[00:04:37] and navigate those connections in a
[00:04:39] coherent way I'd get overwhelmed and I
[00:04:41] wouldn't know where to start whereas on
[00:04:43] the other hand if you have a look at
[00:04:45] this part of the same map where it just
[00:04:47] happened to look more clean and more
[00:04:49] organized and I remember I thought about
[00:04:52] it a little bit more to try to get it
[00:04:53] clean and organized then I was able to
[00:04:56] talk about this part and answer problems
[00:04:58] related to these things much more easily
[00:05:02] and it didn't matter what someone asked
[00:05:05] me about this I had a confidence with
[00:05:07] the topic that I could hit it from any
[00:05:09] angle and navigate it in any direction
[00:05:11] and as I slowly started to make my mind
[00:05:14] maps more clean and more organized and
[00:05:17] look at the messy things and then use
[00:05:19] that as an opportunity to clean that
[00:05:20] part up I started entering into exams
[00:05:23] where you'd have these curveball
[00:05:24] questions that used to make me think
[00:05:27] holy crap I've never seen this before
[00:05:29] before I've never thought about it this
[00:05:30] way before they never taught me this I
[00:05:33] started thinking of it like hm that's an
[00:05:36] interesting angle to explore I can make
[00:05:39] that work and I'd never been able to
[00:05:41] think about these types of questions
[00:05:43] with that mentality before but it really
[00:05:44] took years to embrace that part where I
[00:05:48] was willing to put down something on my
[00:05:50] mind map that wasn't that organized that
[00:05:54] wasn't that good I had this feeling that
[00:05:56] when I write it on my map it should be
[00:05:59] as perfect as possible so if you have a
[00:06:01] look at this m map that I did really
[00:06:03] really early on you can see that it
[00:06:05] looks really clean but it's clean
[00:06:08] because I just didn't put all the
[00:06:10] information on it because I knew that as
[00:06:11] soon as I tried to add more stuff it was
[00:06:13] going to get messy so it's not that it
[00:06:15] was more organized in my brain it's like
[00:06:17] I literally just avoided the part that
[00:06:19] made it more confusing which like I
[00:06:22] needed all of that knowledge anyway so
[00:06:24] the secret is don't do that if it's
[00:06:26] messy put it down use your map like a
[00:06:30] mirror put down what you're thinking add
[00:06:32] all the connections add all the arrows
[00:06:34] let it be messy and then when it's on
[00:06:37] paper you can look at it you can see the
[00:06:39] mistakes and the gaps for what it is and
[00:06:42] then you can start to progressively try
[00:06:44] to clean it up and reorganize it and
[00:06:47] when you don't avoid that when you look
[00:06:49] for the parts that are messy and you
[00:06:51] recognize that that means that that
[00:06:53] structure is not quite clear in your
[00:06:55] head it creates a really high yield
[00:06:58] focused area for your revision any area
[00:07:01] of a map that looks
[00:07:03] disorganized messy arrows or lines
[00:07:06] flying around everywhere or literally
[00:07:09] just like a whole Gap like there's just
[00:07:10] literally nothing there even though you
[00:07:12] know there should be something there
[00:07:14] maybe you just like missed that part of
[00:07:16] the topic these are areas that you
[00:07:19] should work on and being able to
[00:07:21] visually see it makes things so much
[00:07:25] more easy than trying to find your gaps
[00:07:28] through just like going over the same
[00:07:30] thing again and again hoping to find
[00:07:32] something that you missed or like just
[00:07:33] testing yourself with like 10,000
[00:07:35] practice questions which directly
[00:07:37] relates to secret number two never get
[00:07:40] it right on your first try you know how
[00:07:43] I said that if it's messy just put it
[00:07:44] down on paper and then try to organize
[00:07:46] it afterwards well I really mean it you
[00:07:48] see because of my type a typical like
[00:07:51] mid student personality and I had this
[00:07:54] perfectionism and I wanted to create the
[00:07:56] best mind map first try and you might
[00:07:59] have had this experience yourself but
[00:08:01] this is really really hard in fact I
[00:08:04] actually wonder if it's humanly possible
[00:08:07] for most topics I realized that there
[00:08:09] are usually so many Concepts and
[00:08:11] keywords and potential relationships
[00:08:13] that you can overload your brain within
[00:08:16] like minutes of thinking about it I
[00:08:18] can't even imagine trying to think about
[00:08:21] every single connection and pattern and
[00:08:23] every concept and create this like
[00:08:25] perfect knowledge schema of an entire
[00:08:27] topic first try without making any
[00:08:30] mistakes I actually don't think the
[00:08:32] human brain is capable of that level of
[00:08:35] processing what is infinitely more
[00:08:38] efficient and way easier is to just put
[00:08:41] your ideas down as hypotheses and just
[00:08:44] work and build on them as you go put
[00:08:47] down some words draw a few lines think
[00:08:50] maybe I could organize it like this or
[00:08:53] wonder if that makes sense or maybe I
[00:08:55] could do it like this wonder if that
[00:08:56] makes sense I don't know let me come
[00:08:58] back to it later read a little bit more
[00:09:01] add a few more words add a few more
[00:09:03] lines think does it make sense I don't
[00:09:06] know come back to it later like if you
[00:09:08] use your mapping as a cognitive offload
[00:09:12] so that it stops things from getting
[00:09:14] overwhelming and you can literally look
[00:09:16] at the ideas that you were thinking of
[00:09:18] and then refine them and when you think
[00:09:21] about it as everything you write down in
[00:09:23] the first go it's all going to be wrong
[00:09:25] like nothing in there is going to be
[00:09:27] perfect you're using it like a
[00:09:29] whiteboard like a scratch Pad so that on
[00:09:31] the fifth or sixth or seventh iteration
[00:09:35] of organization and thinking about it
[00:09:37] you can get it to a point where it's
[00:09:38] like accurate and really really good and
[00:09:40] flows and it's like super organized then
[00:09:43] that will be a win you're going to
[00:09:44] notice that you are way more engaged
[00:09:46] while you're reading or listening you're
[00:09:48] going to find that you're aware of
[00:09:50] knowledge gaps much earlier on you'll
[00:09:53] find that your memory is much deeper
[00:09:55] you'll find that your depth of
[00:09:57] understanding is more nuanced and for
[00:09:58] the same amount of time spent studying
[00:10:01] you will end up with a much more robust
[00:10:04] set of knowledge in the early days I
[00:10:06] used to try to get it right the first
[00:10:08] time and I used to think like maybe just
[00:10:11] by continuing to push to get it right
[00:10:13] the first time it's going to train my
[00:10:15] brain's ability to like process and
[00:10:17] think about it and then one day if I
[00:10:19] keep pushing at it I will get to a point
[00:10:21] where like my first my map first go is
[00:10:23] just like Immaculate so my first attempt
[00:10:26] is a lot better than I would have been
[00:10:27] able to do 10 years ago it is still
[00:10:30] impossible to get it right the first
[00:10:32] time and trying to do that always leads
[00:10:35] to something that is lower quality and
[00:10:39] just more time consuming it is a
[00:10:41] complete lose lose situation and I want
[00:10:44] you to compare that with something that
[00:10:45] is completely
[00:10:47] winwin for example liking this video
[00:10:51] when you like this video I win because
[00:10:53] this video reaches more people and you
[00:10:55] win because it means that I keep making
[00:10:57] videos for free every week you could
[00:11:00] even turn it into a triple win by
[00:11:03] subscribing anyway speaking of winning
[00:11:05] moves uh we've got secret number three
[00:11:07] which is never ever ever start
[00:11:13] organizing your ideas the same way it is
[00:11:17] presented to you now this is kind of a
[00:11:19] tricky one so listen carefully there's
[00:11:21] this cognitive bias called framing bias
[00:11:24] framing bias is basically your brain's
[00:11:26] tendency to judge later in information
[00:11:30] based on how it was presented or framed
[00:11:33] to you this is talked about a lot in
[00:11:36] fields like medicine where you know you
[00:11:38] could have a junior doctor say hey uh
[00:11:40] boss can you have a look at this patient
[00:11:41] they've got gastritis you know a bit of
[00:11:43] heartburn uh they coming in with you
[00:11:46] know pain you know like right here like
[00:11:48] above their stomach and they get this
[00:11:50] kind of like acid sensation in the back
[00:11:52] of their throat it's like a burning
[00:11:53] feeling coming up it's worse after they
[00:11:55] eat then that way of presenting the
[00:11:59] patient makes someone think okay yeah
[00:12:01] they've said hey boss I've got someone
[00:12:04] with heartburn and then they describe
[00:12:06] these things that sound like heartburn
[00:12:09] but it might not be it might be a heart
[00:12:10] attack it might be like an atypical
[00:12:13] presentation of a heart attack but you
[00:12:15] don't want to bias yourself into
[00:12:17] thinking yep it's heartburn and
[00:12:18] therefore miss the heart attack and this
[00:12:21] is the same thing when it comes to
[00:12:22] studying a lot of the time when you're
[00:12:24] taught something in lecture slides or
[00:12:26] like a textbook there are headings and
[00:12:28] sub headings and there's a certain
[00:12:30] organizational hierarchy that someone
[00:12:32] thought this is a logical way of
[00:12:35] teaching it to someone else every now
[00:12:37] and again you get lectures where you
[00:12:38] wonder like did they ever even think
[00:12:40] about what would be a logical way of
[00:12:41] teaching this to us but regardless you
[00:12:44] can't avoid the fact that when you're
[00:12:45] learning something you are consuming
[00:12:48] that information in someone else's frame
[00:12:52] and that's going to bias the way you
[00:12:53] think about it now the problem is that
[00:12:56] the way that it makes sense for you and
[00:12:58] the way way that you should organize it
[00:13:00] that makes the most sense for your brain
[00:13:02] is not always the same that's why you
[00:13:05] could have an expert teacher explain
[00:13:08] something to you but then when your
[00:13:09] friend explains it to you it actually
[00:13:11] clicks and makes sense a lot more easily
[00:13:13] it's more intuitive or you could read
[00:13:14] two books about the same topic but one
[00:13:16] book just explains it in a way that just
[00:13:18] feels so much more intuitive for you but
[00:13:21] maybe for another person they prefer the
[00:13:23] other book and it's not about how
[00:13:25] they're going to test or examine or how
[00:13:28] you need to use your knowledge either
[00:13:30] and that's a common thought you can
[00:13:32] learn something in a frame in an
[00:13:35] organizational structure that's not the
[00:13:37] same as how they're going to test you
[00:13:39] but if that's the way that makes more
[00:13:40] sense for your brain it's going to be
[00:13:42] easier for your brain to encode that
[00:13:44] information keep it in your memory and
[00:13:46] reinforce the pathways and once that
[00:13:48] knowledge is there you can then use that
[00:13:50] knowledge in whatever Direction and
[00:13:52] angle that you want you can make the
[00:13:54] knowledge fit how you need to apply it
[00:13:57] it's much less effective to try to force
[00:14:00] your brain to understand it in the way
[00:14:03] you need to apply it or how you're going
[00:14:05] to be tested if that's not a way that
[00:14:07] makes sense for your brain you're now
[00:14:10] going to be fighting against how your
[00:14:11] brain wants to learn it for the sake of
[00:14:14] meeting some marking criteria when it
[00:14:16] would actually be much faster to learn
[00:14:18] it the way your brain wants to that
[00:14:20] makes the most sense for your brain and
[00:14:22] then just manipulate that information
[00:14:24] more freely once you have legitimately
[00:14:26] better expertise and in some cases you
[00:14:28] can find an angle that hits both it is
[00:14:31] both better for the way you need to use
[00:14:33] your knowledge and it makes more sense
[00:14:34] for your brain a great example of this
[00:14:36] is one time when I was working in the
[00:14:38] emergency department as a student and I
[00:14:41] remember my senior pulled me aside and
[00:14:43] he was like okay tell me everything that
[00:14:45] you know about shock now shock in
[00:14:47] medical speak is basically when your
[00:14:48] body is like shutting down it's like a
[00:14:50] crisis mode and so I said okay well you
[00:14:52] know like a medical student I was like
[00:14:53] okay well there's five different types
[00:14:55] of shock and you know here are all the
[00:14:57] different you know types and there are
[00:14:59] these different examples for every
[00:15:00] single different type and then these are
[00:15:02] the different symptoms and the you know
[00:15:04] mechanisms for each of those subtypes
[00:15:05] and examples and then he was like okay
[00:15:07] okay that's enough like this too slow
[00:15:09] you don't have 5 10 minutes for every
[00:15:11] patient you see for you to like work
[00:15:13] through this checklist and then he pulls
[00:15:15] out a little piece of paper and he draws
[00:15:17] on it in like 45 seconds a very simple
[00:15:21] diagram of the human body and he was
[00:15:23] like think of the body like a pump tubes
[00:15:27] and organs and he showed me how all of
[00:15:30] the different examples that I was
[00:15:32] talking about before really cleanly can
[00:15:35] just be fit into this new framework of
[00:15:39] thinking about shock and after about a
[00:15:42] minute I started thinking this way of
[00:15:45] thinking about shock is so much easier
[00:15:49] than the way that I've been trying to
[00:15:50] learn it before which is how it was
[00:15:51] taught to me in my lectures and in my
[00:15:53] textbooks and it's not like it was some
[00:15:55] ridiculously like technical you know
[00:15:58] Advanced way way of thinking about it I
[00:16:00] could totally have just myself thought
[00:16:03] of a different way to repackage that
[00:16:05] material in a way that made more sense
[00:16:07] for me and I probably would have arrived
[00:16:09] at that same framework I just never
[00:16:13] bothered to I didn't realize it would
[00:16:15] help me and when I started thinking
[00:16:16] about it in this way my retention was
[00:16:18] bter I was able to use that information
[00:16:20] more freely like I could recall it much
[00:16:22] more quickly it just felt much more
[00:16:24] intuitive it was bitter in every way and
[00:16:26] I didn't have to just memorize
[00:16:28] everything like I was doing before it
[00:16:29] was the same amount of information just
[00:16:33] filed away in a different way and so
[00:16:35] here's the learning point if we start by
[00:16:38] assuming that the way something is
[00:16:40] presented to us is the right way to
[00:16:44] learn it and that's going to affect the
[00:16:46] way that we can organize the information
[00:16:48] and it's going to stop us from seeing
[00:16:50] potentially other Frameworks a lot of
[00:16:52] the time people will say well this
[00:16:55] method that they have taught me is
[00:16:56] really really logical it makes sense
[00:16:59] already how could there be any other way
[00:17:02] of learning it all I have to do is just
[00:17:04] take this and then memorize it but
[00:17:06] here's the thing if you need to memorize
[00:17:09] it in order for you to remember it it
[00:17:12] probably means it's not that intuitive
[00:17:15] it might be logical but there could be
[00:17:18] another way of thinking about it that is
[00:17:21] just as logical but more intuitive and
[00:17:24] you're never going to know until you
[00:17:26] deliberately look for it and I found
[00:17:28] that for most topics there is usually
[00:17:31] more often than not a way of repackaging
[00:17:35] the information to make it more optimal
[00:17:37] for your brain and for your memory so
[00:17:39] just for my personal experience or
[00:17:40] experience working with students here's
[00:17:42] a few examples of ways that things have
[00:17:44] traditionally been packaged and then how
[00:17:47] students have been able to repackage it
[00:17:49] in ways that made more sense for them so
[00:17:51] for something like history or historical
[00:17:53] events often things have been presented
[00:17:55] to them in a way that's like before
[00:17:58] during during and after but an
[00:18:00] alternative grouping might be something
[00:18:02] like drivers mechanisms and consequences
[00:18:06] which is again also very logical but
[00:18:08] potentially more intuitive depending on
[00:18:10] the topic for subject like medicine or
[00:18:13] Dentistry often things are presented
[00:18:14] like history examination investigation
[00:18:18] and management now the problem with this
[00:18:20] is that like every disease is presented
[00:18:22] in this way and so what becomes
[00:18:24] problematic is that because every single
[00:18:26] thing is like categorized the exact same
[00:18:29] way that categorization doesn't actually
[00:18:31] help you to remember the information
[00:18:33] like the the categories become
[00:18:35] meaningless because everything is
[00:18:36] categorized that way but in some cases
[00:18:38] for some diseases it might actually make
[00:18:40] more sense to divide it into something
[00:18:41] that's more like mechanisms or
[00:18:45] pathophysiology and then severity and
[00:18:48] then the management comes off as an
[00:18:50] example of how you treat anything that
[00:18:53] has that kind of mechanism and that
[00:18:56] level of severity and again these are
[00:18:57] just a couple of examples there's
[00:18:59] literally hundreds of different ways
[00:19:01] that you can package information and I
[00:19:04] think it is a pretty characteristic sign
[00:19:07] of a highlevel learner to be able to
[00:19:09] find a way of organizing information in
[00:19:12] a way that feels more intuitive for them
[00:19:14] and I'm not saying that you can't ever
[00:19:16] organize it in the same way that it was
[00:19:18] taught to you but I'm saying that if you
[00:19:19] do end up organizing it in the same way
[00:19:21] that should be an independent conclusion
[00:19:23] that you arrive at after you have really
[00:19:26] thought about it and have thought about
[00:19:27] Alternatives and as a quick TST if you
[00:19:29] look at how you've organized and grouped
[00:19:30] your information and you think I don't
[00:19:33] even know any other way to arrange this
[00:19:35] it probably means that you can think
[00:19:37] about it a little bit more after all you
[00:19:39] can't decide that something is the best
[00:19:41] way if you don't even know of any other
[00:19:43] ways and trust me there's always some
[00:19:45] other way now next up is our final
[00:19:47] secret but first a word from our sponsor
[00:19:50] yes that is again me most of the stuff
[00:19:53] that I talk about in all of my videos
[00:19:55] has been in my guided program for years
[00:19:57] it is a distillation of over a decade of
[00:20:00] my experience helping Learners become
[00:20:02] Ultra efficient in a stepbystep guided
[00:20:05] program we only need to spend like 20 30
[00:20:07] minutes every 2 or 3 days to take in
[00:20:09] some new Theory and techniques you then
[00:20:11] practice them throughout the week and
[00:20:13] you can get feedback within our
[00:20:14] community and our team of coaches making
[00:20:16] the program the best it can be is where
[00:20:18] the majority of my time and focus goes
[00:20:21] if you're interested you can check it
[00:20:22] out at i.com I'll put a link in the
[00:20:23] description and so finally secret number
[00:20:26] four which is to integrate the Fineman
[00:20:29] technique now the fan technique
[00:20:30] basically says that if you want to learn
[00:20:31] something you should try to explain it
[00:20:33] to a 10-year-old and there's a little
[00:20:35] bit more to it than that but this
[00:20:36] mindset complements mind mapping
[00:20:39] perfectly and the reason is because
[00:20:41] especially when we learn a new topic
[00:20:43] there's often a lot of new terminology
[00:20:46] and
[00:20:47] terminology is like vanilla Essence let
[00:20:50] me explain if you've ever opened up a
[00:20:52] bottle of vanilla Essence before you
[00:20:55] know that that stuff is potent you you
[00:20:58] know you literally put like a like a
[00:20:59] tiny little teaspoon of vanilla Essence
[00:21:01] to like vanilla flavor an entire Cake
[00:21:04] The Humble vanilla bean has been
[00:21:07] ruthlessly concentrated and extracted so
[00:21:10] that for just like a few drops of this
[00:21:14] Villar Ence you are getting like a
[00:21:16] concentrated bomb of flavor and that is
[00:21:18] exactly what terminology is when we
[00:21:21] learn a new piece of terminology it's
[00:21:24] not just a word or a couple of words it
[00:21:26] is an entire net work of ideas and
[00:21:29] relationships that were so complicated
[00:21:31] that someone decided we need a whole
[00:21:33] word just for it and so when we
[00:21:35] introduce new terminology into our mind
[00:21:38] maps or our notes it can overload our
[00:21:40] brain very easily and so one way that we
[00:21:42] can supercharge our mind maps is to
[00:21:44] deliberately use non-technical words
[00:21:47] that a 10-year-old could understand so
[00:21:49] for example let's say you're studying
[00:21:50] cell division and there's a phase and
[00:21:52] there it's called anaphase instead of
[00:21:53] writing anaphase you can just write away
[00:21:56] which is basically what happens in that
[00:21:57] phase and you can still have your
[00:21:58] terminology under it so you don't forget
[00:22:00] it you just have it in Brackets
[00:22:02] underneath but by taking a moment to
[00:22:04] turn that terminology into a simpler
[00:22:06] word not only do we deepen our
[00:22:08] understanding of that word by turning
[00:22:10] into something that we feel we're able
[00:22:12] to understand more intuitively which is
[00:22:14] like making a mini analogy we're also
[00:22:16] able to speed up our review of that
[00:22:19] information because our brain can spend
[00:22:21] more time thinking about the ideas and
[00:22:23] less time reading each piece of
[00:22:25] terminology and spending 10 15 seconds
[00:22:27] trying unpack exactly what that word
[00:22:29] meant and the reason this is secret
[00:22:31] number four is that if you actually just
[00:22:32] try to do this you'll realize that it's
[00:22:34] kind of impossible to do it properly
[00:22:36] without doing Secrets number one two and
[00:22:38] three first now I've told people to do
[00:22:39] mind maps with these methods for years
[00:22:43] and if you've tried mind mapping before
[00:22:44] and it wasn't really that good then try
[00:22:46] it again with these tips and I guarantee
[00:22:48] you you're going to have a completely
[00:22:49] different experience it will feel more
[00:22:51] challenging but that is your brain
[00:22:53] trying to figure things out that is your
[00:22:55] brain being active in the learning
[00:22:56] process and that's going to result than
[00:22:58] you having a better memory and a better
[00:22:59] depth of understanding challenging is
[00:23:02] good so give these tips a go I'm sure
[00:23:03] they're going to help thanks for
[00:23:05] watching and I'll see you next
[00:23:06] [Music]
[00:23:08] time


=== Good students understand this point ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdHvPpHV_U0

[00:00:00] so for the first thing about cramming
[00:00:01] the right way is to understand that
[00:00:03] you're in a compromised position anyway
[00:00:05] you're going to lose something and you
[00:00:07] have to be strategic about what you're
[00:00:08] going to lose if you haven't started
[00:00:10] studying for something 3 days before
[00:00:11] your exam and you're expecting to still
[00:00:13] do really well you're either a genius or
[00:00:16] you're delusional


=== Good students understand this idea ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNWi-Qgzia4

[00:00:00] most institutions in most countries are
[00:00:02] legally obligated to test you on the
[00:00:04] learning objectives now they don't have
[00:00:05] to test you on every single learning
[00:00:08] objective and what Falls within the
[00:00:10] scope of a learning objective can be
[00:00:12] quite a gray area sometimes but there's
[00:00:15] still a useful guide to work off and
[00:00:17] most examiners are going to think like
[00:00:19] this there's a list of learning
[00:00:20] objectives that they have for that
[00:00:22] particular subject let's say that there
[00:00:23] are three for one lecture and they're
[00:00:26] going to be thinking how can they test
[00:00:27] these learning objectives at these
[00:00:29] different levels of learning


=== You can learn anything it you go slowly enough ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wt0XHXwLxiU

[00:00:00] what is considered new and novel
[00:00:01] information depends on what you already
[00:00:03] know so if you're constantly building
[00:00:05] your prior knowledge in these small
[00:00:07] layers of just 1% at a time then every
[00:00:10] step is basically the same level of
[00:00:12] difficulty like I do not know anything
[00:00:13] about a resuscitative hysterotomy at all
[00:00:16] I actually like never even heard of that
[00:00:17] before honestly rather than saying it's
[00:00:19] not relevant to me but I'm just going to
[00:00:20] learn it now anyway and so the only way
[00:00:22] to do that is repeatedly smash it into
[00:00:24] my brain multiple times for you know
[00:00:27] days weeks sometimes years for it to
[00:00:29] finally stick and then by that point you
[00:00:30] don't even have to have memorized it
[00:00:32] because by that point you're like oh
[00:00:33] it's actually kind of obvious now


=== The #1 way students waste their time ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xpXmkDBBeo

[00:00:00] the mindset is often oh I need to spend
[00:00:02] longer so I'm going to take longer
[00:00:04] that's the wrong way it's I need to do
[00:00:06] it in this amount of time so you get it
[00:00:08] done what you end up skipping you skip
[00:00:10] that's the point the point is that you
[00:00:12] force yourself to skip certain things
[00:00:13] and really hone in on things that just
[00:00:15] build that overarching structure so that
[00:00:17] you're not getting bogged down by all
[00:00:18] the little details that are irrelevant
[00:00:19] and meaningless and purposeless for you
[00:00:21] to learn right now


=== Use your lecture objective to get good grades ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPDPe1HxmRI

[00:00:00] and so when you scan through your
[00:00:00] lecture objectives you can actually get
[00:00:02] a reasonably good map for how they're
[00:00:05] likely to test you now remember you're
[00:00:07] going to lose something you're not going
[00:00:09] to be able to cover every single
[00:00:11] question there are going to be things
[00:00:13] that you miss but this is a more
[00:00:14] strategic way of using your time it
[00:00:16] increases the probability of getting
[00:00:18] more questions correct


=== Why K-Drama is better than medical school ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxUGglTkYRg

[00:00:00] this's this Korean Netflix show there's
[00:00:02] this medical student and one of their
[00:00:04] crew members are like they get injured
[00:00:06] and so this medical student has to
[00:00:08] operate on them in like their crdy
[00:00:09] shelter basement type thing and so what
[00:00:11] they do is they open up the anatomy
[00:00:13] textbooks and they just study like all
[00:00:15] night to try to figure out how they're
[00:00:16] going to operate on this person that is
[00:00:18] really great learning environment right
[00:00:19] so if you would to learn anatomy in the
[00:00:21] way that you're saying okay like how
[00:00:22] would I operate on this person then
[00:00:24] you're going to know that there's a
[00:00:25] blood vessel there because you're aware
[00:00:26] of the fact that you can't cut into it
[00:00:27] you know you know where you need to
[00:00:29] blunt dissect because you're afraid of
[00:00:30] vessels or or nervous Supply that's in
[00:00:32] that particular area you know the
[00:00:33] structure of the bones actually starts
[00:00:34] making sense because that's where you
[00:00:35] know you'd expect there to be more
[00:00:37] tension and the bone might displace in
[00:00:38] this direction or something like that
[00:00:39] there's always a context like there's a
[00:00:41] purpose for the knowledge but that
[00:00:42] purpose is completely removed normally
[00:00:44] what I'm saying is that purpose needs to
[00:00:45] be the first thing before even knowing
[00:00:48] about the insertion or the blood vessels
[00:00:49] or the supply or the pathology or the
[00:00:51] molecular structure or whatever before
[00:00:52] all of that is there we need to know why
[00:00:54] it's relevant the purpose behind it and
[00:00:56] then we're ready to learn


=== The trick to learning math is NOT the numbers ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id9y15qcQOY

[00:00:00] with math uh there's not that many
[00:00:01] Concepts not as much as something like
[00:00:03] biology or physics or chemistry or the
[00:00:05] Sciences or even something like politics
[00:00:06] or economics or things like that so it's
[00:00:08] actually very easy to do this entire
[00:00:10] process we've been talking about you
[00:00:11] just look at what you're being taught
[00:00:12] and you say well what's the purpose of
[00:00:13] it what's the big picture how can I
[00:00:15] apply it why is that actually important
[00:00:17] and how is that similar to these other
[00:00:18] things that I've learned how are they
[00:00:20] all related together and then you can
[00:00:21] group those things in a very similar way
[00:00:23] and now you've got okay so we've got
[00:00:24] these equations that you know generally
[00:00:26] allow me to do this there are these
[00:00:27] things that allow me to do this and
[00:00:28] they're related because you know this is
[00:00:30] the previous step or you know I need to
[00:00:32] do this to create this kind of variable
[00:00:34] so that I can actually use it in this
[00:00:35] kind of process and we get a really good
[00:00:37] conceptual understanding of it and then
[00:00:38] the rest is just procedural then you
[00:00:40] practice doing the equations you
[00:00:41] practice your questions you make sure
[00:00:43] that you're able to you know carry the
[00:00:44] three and you can apply the chain rule
[00:00:46] effectively and all those things


=== Learn math without the numbers first ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXS1cYfggO8

[00:00:00] you want to learn maths without the
[00:00:01] numbers first you want to have a
[00:00:03] conceptual understanding of math because
[00:00:05] understanding just like how you would
[00:00:07] understand it in biology or physics or
[00:00:08] chemistry or just like how you
[00:00:10] understand concepts for those subjects
[00:00:11] understanding concepts for math is
[00:00:13] equally important in fact it's even
[00:00:14] arguably more important because when you
[00:00:16] see a problem and it's not just like
[00:00:17] differentiate this you know or like find
[00:00:19] the area under the curve where it's just
[00:00:20] like simple Plug and Play when it's
[00:00:22] bringing it together in different
[00:00:23] context and now it's not just like
[00:00:25] numbers but it's like the velocity of
[00:00:26] this particular thing and like the you
[00:00:28] know force of gravity acting you know
[00:00:29] when there's multiple variables stacked
[00:00:31] on top of it what allows you to actually
[00:00:33] solve it is to conceptually understand
[00:00:36] how you can approach that in the first
[00:00:37] place and then what follows from that is
[00:00:39] knowing what the equations are but what
[00:00:40] a lot of people do is they look at Mass
[00:00:42] purely procedurally and they look at an
[00:00:43] isolation and so when they look at a
[00:00:45] problem what they're trying to do is
[00:00:46] just pattern recognition they're trying
[00:00:47] to say can I get the variables
[00:00:49] represented in here to fit into any of
[00:00:52] the equations that I know about


=== You need to study like you're sitting an exam ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koj3KoLHAyw

[00:00:00] if you want to be able to use your
[00:00:01] knowledge in a fluid way that allows you
[00:00:03] to bring multiple pieces of information
[00:00:05] together and retrieve it and with
[00:00:06] complexity and nuance and you're able to
[00:00:08] adapt that information if the situation
[00:00:10] or question changes you have to be
[00:00:12] thinking in that way as well when you're
[00:00:14] studying it you can't be thinking in a
[00:00:16] way that is isolated fragmented lowlevel
[00:00:18] memorization heavy and expect to just be
[00:00:21] able like it's not inherent just because
[00:00:23] you know each part in isolation doesn't
[00:00:24] mean you can actually bring it all
[00:00:25] together when you want to retrieve it at
[00:00:27] that level so you have to match the way
[00:00:28] you're studying with the way that you
[00:00:30] level that you want to retrieve it at


=== Become a Top 0.1% Student by Avoiding This ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja0U5xOT-uw

[00:00:00] today I'm going to be exposing something
[00:00:01] that I think is kind of irresponsible in
[00:00:04] the studying influencer space what I'm
[00:00:07] talking about is the obsession with
[00:00:09] making pretty notes that look like this
[00:00:12] in this video I'll talk about the
[00:00:14] problems with making notes that look
[00:00:15] like this and why top Learners usually
[00:00:18] have messy notes instead towards the end
[00:00:21] of the video I'll also give you a
[00:00:22] demonstration and explain how you should
[00:00:24] be thinking about writing notes and why
[00:00:26] pretty notes would just never really be
[00:00:29] as good so let's say I'm reading a
[00:00:31] textbook and I'm reading through Page by
[00:00:33] Page there's a few things that need to
[00:00:36] happen in order for that knowledge to go
[00:00:39] inside my brain step one I need to
[00:00:42] literally consume the information I need
[00:00:44] to read it step two I need to think
[00:00:47] about the information in such a way that
[00:00:50] it allows the information to be
[00:00:51] organized made sense of and therefore
[00:00:55] retained within my memory just because
[00:00:57] we did step one and information went in
[00:01:00] doesn't mean that it's going to stay
[00:01:01] there we all know that and the third
[00:01:03] part which is where note taking comes in
[00:01:06] we need to write notes in such a way
[00:01:09] that it allows our brain to do that
[00:01:12] thinking and not get overloaded it's
[00:01:14] like if someone gives you Direction
[00:01:16] somewhere and there's like 50 different
[00:01:18] steps to go from point A to point B it's
[00:01:20] a lot easier to plan it out if you write
[00:01:23] down what they're saying and obviously
[00:01:25] when we write our notes it also gives us
[00:01:27] a reference for us to refer back to
[00:01:29] later which is great for our revision
[00:01:30] but the way you write the notes makes a
[00:01:33] really big difference you cannot just
[00:01:35] for example skip step two you can't go
[00:01:38] from reading everything and then just
[00:01:40] typing out everything that you can think
[00:01:43] of and then saying hey here's my perfect
[00:01:45] set of notes it's like structured
[00:01:47] perfectly in like obsidian or notion or
[00:01:49] like ever note whatever you're using if
[00:01:51] you've skipped step two which is the
[00:01:53] actual thinking about the information to
[00:01:55] decide how you want to represent it you
[00:01:59] haven't done any actual learning now
[00:02:01] some people like to just write out a
[00:02:03] bunch of notes and say okay I'm going to
[00:02:04] come back to this later I haven't
[00:02:06] properly learned it yet I'm just like
[00:02:08] creating my notes first and while I
[00:02:10] completely understand that in fact
[00:02:11] that's what I used to do as well it's
[00:02:13] actually kind of pointless there's no
[00:02:15] need to do that because you're just
[00:02:17] creating extra unnecessary work for
[00:02:20] yourself it can take hours to write out
[00:02:23] all of your notes and if at the end of
[00:02:24] that you haven't actually really learned
[00:02:26] it and all you've done is like create a
[00:02:27] reference document for yourself to do
[00:02:29] the proper learning later you may as
[00:02:31] well have just done it right the first
[00:02:33] time round if you had two options option
[00:02:35] A is to spend 5 hours writing notes and
[00:02:38] learn only half of it a week later and
[00:02:40] the other option is to spend the same 5
[00:02:42] hours writing notes but learn and
[00:02:43] remember 90% of it a week later and have
[00:02:46] it even deeper with more nuanced
[00:02:48] understanding it's pretty obvious which
[00:02:50] one we should take the reason that
[00:02:52] people take option A most of the time is
[00:02:54] not because they're an idiot it's
[00:02:55] because they're usually not aware that
[00:02:57] there is an option b and and everyone
[00:03:00] around them just uses option A and it
[00:03:02] just feels like that's the norm but
[00:03:04] thanks to the amazing work of really
[00:03:06] smart researchers out there over the
[00:03:08] last 20 30 years uh we've got an option
[00:03:10] b now so what is that option b and how
[00:03:13] do top Learners write notes and why is
[00:03:16] it messy so let's say that I'm studying
[00:03:19] from this page here from simple mid uh
[00:03:22] which is about a type of antibiotics and
[00:03:25] I read through this first sentence and
[00:03:28] see this diagram now there's a lot of
[00:03:30] information here and there's a lot of
[00:03:32] different ways that I can try to tackle
[00:03:34] this I've got some ideas here I can I
[00:03:37] can try to recreate this existing
[00:03:39] diagram and this existing existing
[00:03:42] structure uh and if I read down through
[00:03:44] here I can see that each of these
[00:03:46] categories are expanded upon pretty
[00:03:49] significantly uh with a lot more
[00:03:51] information so I'm going to go ahead and
[00:03:53] read through this while thinking how
[00:03:56] could I possibly arrange this
[00:03:58] information in the way that makes the
[00:04:00] most sense for me so give me a
[00:04:03] [Music]
[00:04:11] minute so now I read this sentence here
[00:04:15] that says that you know these
[00:04:17] penicillins inhibit bacterial cell wall
[00:04:20] synthesis and it's uh right there in
[00:04:22] bold for me as well now I'm looking at
[00:04:25] what I've written here and I'm thinking
[00:04:26] okay well bacterial cell wall synthesis
[00:04:28] how does that kind of fit in and uh the
[00:04:32] reason that I I bring up this one is
[00:04:34] because in the one directly below it it
[00:04:36] also says inhibiting cell wall synthesis
[00:04:39] and then this one also says cell wall
[00:04:40] synthesis and this one also says cell
[00:04:42] wall synthesis so this seems to be like
[00:04:44] a common recurring pattern uh and so I'm
[00:04:46] going to want to link this up in lots of
[00:04:48] different ways so let me say bacterial
[00:04:50] cell wall synthesis here and I'm
[00:04:53] thinking that there's something there's
[00:04:55] some kind of relationship between all of
[00:04:57] these ones but there's also a relation
[00:04:59] ship between all of these ones uh so
[00:05:03] really all of these relate to this
[00:05:08] singular function that's kind of like my
[00:05:10] my macroscopic view on it so naturally I
[00:05:13] start having questions like well is
[00:05:15] there anything else that inhibits
[00:05:16] bacterial cell wall synthesis is it only
[00:05:19] these uh beta lactam antibiotics that
[00:05:21] inhibit cell wall synthesis and so now
[00:05:23] I've got more questions there's more
[00:05:25] things for me to curious about there's
[00:05:26] like another direction that I want to
[00:05:27] pursue and you can imagine how if this
[00:05:29] is the only thing that inhibits cell
[00:05:31] wall synthesis that's going to change
[00:05:33] the way I structure my notes compared to
[00:05:35] if it's one of two things or one of 10
[00:05:38] things and I'm also thinking how are
[00:05:40] these actually different from each other
[00:05:44] if they all contribute to bacterial cell
[00:05:47] wall synthesis like why when would you
[00:05:49] use one over the other if it if it seems
[00:05:51] like it's kind of the same thing I don't
[00:05:52] know let's read some more and with just
[00:05:54] a little bit more reading I've come
[00:05:56] across this thing that says it's
[00:05:57] effective against certain bacteria that
[00:05:59] a gram positive but it's not against
[00:06:01] certain bacteria that's gram negative so
[00:06:04] these are now like two additional words
[00:06:06] gram positive and gram negative and so
[00:06:10] now I'm starting to understand that okay
[00:06:11] well maybe some of these other
[00:06:12] antibiotics they're effective against
[00:06:14] gram positive more or gram negative more
[00:06:18] and you know maybe all beta lactams are
[00:06:21] only effective against gram positive but
[00:06:23] not against gram negative but either way
[00:06:26] I'm thinking that this is going to have
[00:06:27] some kind of impact like it's going to
[00:06:29] be related to this in some sort of way
[00:06:31] let's read a little bit more picked up
[00:06:33] another word here the idea of anerobic
[00:06:35] versus
[00:06:42] aerobic okay so as you can see now the
[00:06:45] notes are starting to develop into
[00:06:47] something that looks a lot more complex
[00:06:49] and a lot Messier and the thing is that
[00:06:52] these are all very important connections
[00:06:55] and relationships for me to think about
[00:06:58] and when I'm writing notes linearly
[00:07:00] there isn't a good way to really
[00:07:01] represent it now at the moment it looks
[00:07:03] really messy because my mind is going in
[00:07:06] lots of different directions and you
[00:07:08] might look at this and say that looks
[00:07:11] like total crap I can't understand
[00:07:13] what's going on at all and it's totally
[00:07:15] fair because this is not the final
[00:07:17] product but it is helping me to track my
[00:07:20] thoughts so that I can come back and
[00:07:21] clean it up later but unlike writing it
[00:07:24] linearly where it might look relatively
[00:07:26] neat to start with I'm keeping keeping
[00:07:29] track of more connections and more
[00:07:32] relationships all of these things are
[00:07:34] going to deepen my memory and deepen my
[00:07:36] knowledge it's keeping my brain in this
[00:07:38] very active relational state where I'm
[00:07:41] constantly thinking about how each new
[00:07:43] piece of information relates to the
[00:07:45] other pieces of information and how it
[00:07:47] all fits together and these are the
[00:07:50] exact processes that promote a stronger
[00:07:53] memory and a deeper understanding of
[00:07:55] knowledge these processes are also very
[00:07:57] hard to do if you cannot see the
[00:08:00] relationships that you're thinking about
[00:08:02] such as when we write the linear pretty
[00:08:04] notes and so at this point when I look
[00:08:06] at this I think okay there's a few
[00:08:08] things going on here that I think might
[00:08:10] be recurring themes and ideas cwall
[00:08:14] synthesis gram positive gram negative
[00:08:17] aerobic versus anerobic and I'm starting
[00:08:20] to see that these might be more
[00:08:22] important Concepts because they repeat
[00:08:24] so frequently in what I'm reading that
[00:08:27] maybe that's the main stem of this topic
[00:08:31] and not the actual specific names of the
[00:08:33] antibiotics themselves and so what I'm
[00:08:35] going to do now is I'm just going to
[00:08:36] spend about 5 minutes to clean up what
[00:08:39] I've got to make it more organized so as
[00:08:42] you can see I'm going back and forth I'm
[00:08:44] moving around I'm moving things around
[00:08:47] uh and I'm basically trying to solve a
[00:08:48] jigsaw puzzle I'm taking pieces I'm
[00:08:52] seeing if it fits somewhere if not I'm
[00:08:54] putting it back I'm picking up another
[00:08:56] piece testing it out and mentally I'm
[00:08:59] just trying to make it all make sense
[00:09:01] into a clean big picture I don't want to
[00:09:03] get 3 hours deep into a study session
[00:09:05] and think okay I've got no idea what's
[00:09:07] going on I feel overwhelmed you know
[00:09:09] there's a ton of information I need to
[00:09:11] get through uh but at least I've got a
[00:09:12] nice set of notes you know I'll leave
[00:09:14] the actual learning for the weekend I
[00:09:15] don't want that cuz that's just going to
[00:09:17] create learning debt for myself which
[00:09:20] I'm going to have to just deal with
[00:09:21] eventually and that's going to make me
[00:09:23] overwhelmed and just like how it's
[00:09:26] pretty much impossible to solve a jigsaw
[00:09:27] puzzle by you know G amazing at the
[00:09:30] pieces and then perfectly picking up
[00:09:32] each one in order and placing it exactly
[00:09:34] where it needs to go building the
[00:09:36] picture of what you are learning and
[00:09:39] building a conceptual Web of Knowledge
[00:09:41] Tak some trial and error and you can see
[00:09:43] me doing that trial and error uh on on
[00:09:46] the page and it's it's a lot easier to
[00:09:47] do it because it's hair on the page and
[00:09:50] that process is naturally messy in
[00:09:52] learning science we use the word
[00:09:53] recursive that which means that uh
[00:09:56] learning by Nature involves us going
[00:09:58] back and forth uh over things multiple
[00:10:00] times looking at it through different
[00:10:01] lenses and so this process of like
[00:10:05] having a mess that you are progressively
[00:10:07] trying to clean up at a big picture
[00:10:09] level this is necessary for Effective
[00:10:13] learning and this is where the problem
[00:10:16] with pretty notes comes in it's like
[00:10:18] trying to solve a puzzle perfectly the
[00:10:21] first time round there's no room for
[00:10:23] exploration or rearranging any of the
[00:10:25] ideas in fact the only way that we can
[00:10:28] create like this perfect set of notes
[00:10:30] first time round is if we skip step two
[00:10:33] the actual thinking and processing if we
[00:10:35] don't think about things much nothing
[00:10:38] becomes overwhelming it's easy to make
[00:10:40] these pretty notes while feeling
[00:10:42] productive we give ourselves a
[00:10:44] reasonable challenge of trying to make
[00:10:46] it look nice which creates the illusion
[00:10:49] of learning here's a video of me making
[00:10:52] pretty notes for 5 minutes and just to
[00:10:55] show you how actually ineffective it is
[00:10:57] for learning not I'm actually also
[00:11:00] listening to a very catchy and
[00:11:02] distracting music at the exact same time
[00:11:05] and I'm also letting myself get
[00:11:07] distracted every 20 seconds with a timer
[00:11:11] both of these things are obviously uh
[00:11:13] incredibly distracting it makes it
[00:11:15] essentially impossible to do any deep
[00:11:17] and effective learning but notice how
[00:11:20] the quality of my notes or how pretty
[00:11:23] they are is completely unaffected
[00:11:27] despite my brain essentially being
[00:11:30] turned off that's the illusion of
[00:11:32] learning we've got something that looks
[00:11:34] visually great but cognitively empty and
[00:11:38] this is a clear sign that you would be
[00:11:40] engaging in something called passive
[00:11:42] learning which is basically when you're
[00:11:44] doing something where you're brain is
[00:11:45] not actively engaged in the learning
[00:11:48] process and passive learning is in all
[00:11:50] situations a waste of time now not
[00:11:52] everyone that makes pretty notes is
[00:11:54] always doing passive learning and
[00:11:56] obviously not getting like distracted
[00:11:57] every 20 seconds either but what means
[00:11:59] is that writing notes in this way
[00:12:01] doesn't require you to really be
[00:12:03] thinking about it and if you are
[00:12:05] thinking about it in a more effective
[00:12:07] way then writing notes in this way will
[00:12:09] actually hold you back so there's no win
[00:12:12] criteria here there's no way that this
[00:12:14] becomes more effective than an
[00:12:16] alternative and it's not just when we're
[00:12:18] reading either you can apply the same
[00:12:21] thing for even something like when
[00:12:23] you're sitting there in a lecture and
[00:12:24] information is getting bombarded At You
[00:12:26] full speed and you feel like you maybe
[00:12:28] have to write break down everything well
[00:12:30] I actually talk a little bit more about
[00:12:32] how writing lists completely change my
[00:12:35] experience of lectures which I talk
[00:12:36] about in this video and look I'm not
[00:12:38] saying you need to have your notes messy
[00:12:43] forever I am like I love the really nice
[00:12:47] aesthetic notes as much as anyone else
[00:12:50] it doesn't mean your notes have to look
[00:12:52] like the the tangled web of cables
[00:12:54] behind your TV but in fact when you
[00:12:57] start messy and then you try to
[00:12:59] progressively clean it up and make it
[00:13:01] more organized it has a beneficial
[00:13:04] effect on your memory and depth of
[00:13:06] understanding and that's the key that's
[00:13:08] The Sweet Spot when you start messy and
[00:13:11] you try to clean it up you get all the
[00:13:13] benefits of being able to think at that
[00:13:16] higher level and having notes that look
[00:13:19] good too if you want to learn more about
[00:13:21] just writing nonlinear notes in the
[00:13:23] first place you can also check out a
[00:13:25] video that I made on that here I'll
[00:13:26] check out a link in the description too
[00:13:28] and if you want to learn about some of
[00:13:29] the the other things that you should be
[00:13:30] thinking about other than just note
[00:13:32] taking to build out a full Learning
[00:13:34] System then I've got a free quiz that I
[00:13:36] created that's also in the description
[00:13:38] as well as video around how to find your
[00:13:40] learner type when you do the quiz it
[00:13:42] will tell you what your learning
[00:13:43] strengths and weaknesses are so you know
[00:13:46] what's holding you back and what you
[00:13:47] need to work on first thank you so much
[00:13:48] for watching and I'll see you next
[00:13:54] time


=== If you want to pass your exams, STOP TYPING ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kmkKD43jx0

[00:00:00] slower ability to get information on
[00:00:02] page with freehand ends up being
[00:00:04] advantageous because it forces you to be
[00:00:06] stricter with what you're actually
[00:00:07] choosing to write down which probably
[00:00:09] make means that you think about a little
[00:00:11] bit more as a rule of thumb I would say
[00:00:12] freehand if possible with the stylus
[00:00:15] something digital because knowledge does
[00:00:16] not exist mentally in A4 pages right so
[00:00:19] you know structuring something and
[00:00:20] spacing something in a certain way
[00:00:21] because that's how it fits on the page
[00:00:23] is going to be not a good reason to
[00:00:25] limit your learning quality so I
[00:00:27] personally my go-to is I'm always using
[00:00:29] infinite canvas app on I've personally
[00:00:31] got an iPad but you could use any
[00:00:32] basically any device that has got a Pen
[00:00:34] stylus that you can use for it again the
[00:00:35] focus is really on what am I thinking
[00:00:37] about and how aligned is that with what
[00:00:39] I'm writing


=== Creating the placebo effect is smart ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prhruKL_gjk

[00:00:00] there are lots of things that people
[00:00:01] will do because it makes them feel
[00:00:03] better they are creating the placebo
[00:00:04] effect for themselves and in some ways
[00:00:06] it's actually smart it's finding ways
[00:00:09] that you can tap into these powerful
[00:00:12] psychological effects that your mind is
[00:00:14] able to produce at the end of the day
[00:00:16] what matters is how you feel about it
[00:00:17] and the outcomes that you're getting


=== How should you think about nootropics? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai_-V4teJ-U

[00:00:00] this is how I think you should think
[00:00:01] about neut Tropics in order for a neut
[00:00:03] Tropic to be worth it for your money
[00:00:06] because remember you got to pay for it
[00:00:07] most of the time the effect needs to be
[00:00:09] significant enough for it to be worth it
[00:00:11] obviously but the effect is actually
[00:00:13] something that you are measuring
[00:00:15] subjectively yourself and what that
[00:00:17] means is that even if it were a placebo
[00:00:21] you would still potentially find it
[00:00:23] worth it except what you're paying for
[00:00:25] is really a placebo effect the
[00:00:27] alternative is potentially not having
[00:00:29] the placebo and the placebo effect is
[00:00:31] real like you are getting a real benefit
[00:00:33] from it it's just that the benefit
[00:00:35] doesn't come from the actual thing that
[00:00:37] you're like consuming


=== How important is sleep for performance ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pbNuEsZbI

[00:00:00] spending so many hours studying that you
[00:00:01] don't sleep is like spending all day
[00:00:03] trying to fill a bucket and then just
[00:00:05] before you go to sleep you drill a hole
[00:00:07] in the bottom of it sleep is also
[00:00:08] incredibly important for cognitive
[00:00:10] performance so when you're sleep
[00:00:11] deprived you are a slower less focused
[00:00:14] version of yourself and you usually
[00:00:16] won't even know it so now not only do
[00:00:19] you have a hole in the bottom of your
[00:00:20] bucket you have to fill that bucket
[00:00:22] during the day with only your feet and
[00:00:24] you normally don't even realize how
[00:00:27] impaired you are


=== Why learning faster can make you WORSE ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0Yk8PlCWY4

[00:00:00] did you know that trying to learn faster
[00:00:02] can actually make you worse at learning
[00:00:04] let me tell you the story back when I
[00:00:05] was finishing high school before I
[00:00:07] entered into uni I decided that speed
[00:00:10] reading was going to be the technique
[00:00:12] that's just going to change my life and
[00:00:13] so I did this like program and I learned
[00:00:15] to read a lot faster I went from like
[00:00:17] 300 words per minute to like over 1,000
[00:00:20] words per minute what I've realized and
[00:00:22] this is why I'm telling you the story is
[00:00:23] that learning to read faster was not my
[00:00:25] bottleneck but if I have 90%
[00:00:27] comprehension how is that possible it's
[00:00:29] because because that number is just like
[00:00:31] fake it's not real it's a number that's
[00:00:34] based on like a simple fact recall test
[00:00:36] that you're doing like 20 or 30 seconds
[00:00:38] after you read like a single isolated
[00:00:40] piece of text and that's when I realized
[00:00:41] that just doing the same thing that I
[00:00:43] was doing but faster isn't actually
[00:00:46] going to make me a better learner to be
[00:00:49] better I need to do something different
[00:00:52] not just the same thing and more of it
[00:00:54] and it's a lesson that took me an
[00:00:55] embarrassingly long amount of time to
[00:00:57] figure out


=== Have you tried REVERSE goal setting? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4dSt2H_BWc

[00:00:00] and then finally we're ready for step
[00:00:01] five which is to then create the plan
[00:00:04] and this is focused on the immediate
[00:00:06] Next Step the idea is how do we use the
[00:00:08] resources at our disposal to overcome
[00:00:12] the barriers we have identified and help
[00:00:14] us incrementally slightly improve and
[00:00:17] develop closer to becoming that ideal
[00:00:20] person that we have already envisaged
[00:00:23] envisaged en envisaged
[00:00:28] envisioned thought oh

=== Think like a detective when studying ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LnQuT65pWg

[00:00:00] when you study try to think like a
[00:00:02] detective a detective has Clues and
[00:00:05] they're looking for patterns even if
[00:00:07] they're not obvious a detective is
[00:00:09] committed to figuring it out and that's
[00:00:11] exactly the same mindset that you should
[00:00:13] have when you are learning there are
[00:00:14] pieces of information there's a pattern
[00:00:16] there that you need to try to figure out
[00:00:18] and that pattern is not always obvious
[00:00:20] and the way that it's taught to you may
[00:00:22] not show that pattern and the pattern
[00:00:23] you find might not necessarily be the
[00:00:26] same as the pattern that your friend
[00:00:28] finds but as long as it makes sense to
[00:00:30] you it's valid and that's what helps us
[00:00:32] learn the problem is that a lot of the
[00:00:35] time Learners are very time oriented and
[00:00:38] so they think man it's taking me so long
[00:00:39] to see the pattern and by doing so
[00:00:41] they're actually skipping the part of
[00:00:43] learning that is building stronger
[00:00:44] memory and stronger understanding and so
[00:00:46] what's necessary to actually do proper
[00:00:48] learning is actually a commitment to
[00:00:51] figuring it out and finding the pattern
[00:00:53] even when it's hard to and that is what
[00:00:56] distinguishes a great learner from an
[00:00:59] average one


=== How to check your learning efficiency ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR-lqol3IR0

[00:00:00] how efficient is your learning ability
[00:00:01] and I don't mean just like a general
[00:00:03] vague feeling I mean objectively here's
[00:00:06] what you can do take a topic and study
[00:00:07] it for 2 or 3 hours using whatever
[00:00:10] method you feel comfortable with just
[00:00:11] like your normal method of studying and
[00:00:13] then after this create a mini test for
[00:00:16] yourself with 15 questions five of these
[00:00:19] questions should be on just basic
[00:00:21] low-level fact recall definition
[00:00:24] explaining a process five of them should
[00:00:26] be midlevel where you relate two
[00:00:28] concepts to each other and say okay well
[00:00:31] how is this thing related to this thing
[00:00:33] and then five questions should be on the
[00:00:34] high level this is when you take at
[00:00:36] least three different concepts and you
[00:00:39] say yes they're related explain how
[00:00:42] they're related and also the
[00:00:43] significance of that relationship and
[00:00:46] then do this test a week later purely
[00:00:49] from memory without looking at your
[00:00:51] notes and this will give you a quick and
[00:00:53] dirty assessment of your retention and
[00:00:55] ability to use your knowledge at each of
[00:00:58] the levels

=== Toxic productivity is NOT cool ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xyi2Ul5XgZk

[00:00:00] you definitely don't need to be studying
[00:00:02] 120 hours a week to enter into Medical
[00:00:04] School unless you have no idea what
[00:00:05] you're doing like me do not recommend
[00:00:09] working and studying as much as I did it
[00:00:12] is not a better or a cooler way to live
[00:00:15] I think in today's culture it is
[00:00:17] incredibly admirable to say no I don't
[00:00:20] want to buy into the whole hustle
[00:00:22] mentality if you don't want to be that
[00:00:24] busy then there is absolutely nothing
[00:00:27] wrong with that I completely disagree
[00:00:29] with toxic productivity where you're
[00:00:31] just being busy and productive for the
[00:00:33] sake of it just because you're not
[00:00:34] working and studying so much that you
[00:00:36] pee blood it doesn't make you a more
[00:00:38] inferior person


=== What can you do if you do not want to compromise on sleep? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0mVzmYQSQU

[00:00:00] so if we don't compromise on sleep which
[00:00:02] is a smart thing to do then this is what
[00:00:04] would happen we'd have this huge list of
[00:00:06] things to do and then we'd put them on
[00:00:07] the schedule but because we need to
[00:00:09] sleep we wouldn't get it all done so how
[00:00:12] do we win it seems on one hand we either
[00:00:15] compromise on sleep and we lose or on
[00:00:18] the other hand we don't get everything
[00:00:19] done and we lose the trick here is to
[00:00:22] pick your losses it is true you're going
[00:00:25] to lose in one way but sometimes we have
[00:00:28] to lose the game to win the champion
[00:00:30] ship if we lose on sleep we lose on a
[00:00:33] lot of things it's like winning the game
[00:00:35] but then your whole team is hospitalized
[00:00:37] afterwards if we lose on not getting
[00:00:40] everything done that day we can still
[00:00:42] recover from that


=== Mind map is your mind mirror ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1w9vtTkhOE

[00:00:00] so I tried mind mapping one time and I
[00:00:01] found that it was kind of a waste of
[00:00:03] time I didn't really do anything with it
[00:00:05] for like years and then I tried it again
[00:00:08] when I was in medical school and it
[00:00:09] changed everything I used to think my
[00:00:11] mapping was just about like putting some
[00:00:13] things down and then uh drawing some
[00:00:15] lines and arrows and arranging a few
[00:00:17] things and that was kind of it like I
[00:00:19] just thought about it like normal note
[00:00:20] taking but that is completely not it and
[00:00:23] if you do it that way you're going to
[00:00:24] find that it's useless the trick is
[00:00:25] actually to turn it into a mind mirror
[00:00:28] first you want to cut down as much as
[00:00:30] you can how wordy it is and then you
[00:00:32] want to only write down the things that
[00:00:34] you think are important enough and you
[00:00:36] want to arrange it in a way that you
[00:00:37] feel like actually makes sense that
[00:00:39] takes actually a lot of thinking so if
[00:00:41] you're mind mapping but you're finding
[00:00:42] that it doesn't require a lot of
[00:00:44] thinking then it probably means that
[00:00:45] you're not using the right technique and
[00:00:47] when what you write actually becomes a
[00:00:48] reflection of how you've been thinking
[00:00:50] about it it means you can literally
[00:00:52] visually see where there are errors in
[00:00:54] your knowledge which makes your revision
[00:00:57] way easier


=== The importance of sleep in my 100-hour work week ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTZfyLY112w

[00:00:00] you also can't really train yourself to
[00:00:01] sleep less there's been a lot of
[00:00:03] research over the years around different
[00:00:05] sleep timings and the research
[00:00:06] consistently Trends towards the idea
[00:00:09] that you have to get a continuous 7 to 9
[00:00:12] hours of sleep to function properly and
[00:00:14] very very few people can do with less
[00:00:17] than that I personally need 8 and 1 half
[00:00:19] to 9 hours of sleep per night which is
[00:00:21] on the higher side and actually it took
[00:00:23] me some years to accept that the only
[00:00:25] thing that really does seem to reduce
[00:00:27] your sleep requirement is actually age
[00:00:29] when people get older they do require
[00:00:31] less sleep but we're talking about when
[00:00:32] you're in your 50s 607s ' 80s you maybe
[00:00:35] can do with less sleep


=== How perfectionism can hold back your learning ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzgUkwz0lk4

[00:00:00] so I don't know if you know this but
[00:00:01] most medical students and doctors as
[00:00:03] well have a type A personality and that
[00:00:06] kind of means that we have like a
[00:00:08] perfectionism we always want to do
[00:00:09] something and be the best let me tell
[00:00:11] you why that can be completely
[00:00:13] disastrous when it comes to your
[00:00:14] learning when I first started making
[00:00:16] mind maps I wanted everything to be
[00:00:18] perfect I wanted the best possible map
[00:00:20] first go no mistakes I now realize that
[00:00:24] that is actually almost impossible to do
[00:00:26] and actually completely unnecessary to
[00:00:28] get really good at Learning you need to
[00:00:30] be messy it's much better to have a
[00:00:32] messy mind map where you look at it and
[00:00:34] then you can then progressively clean up
[00:00:36] and organize your thoughts and then
[00:00:37] deepen your knowledge rather than not
[00:00:39] having a messy mind map but therefore
[00:00:42] not actually having the organized
[00:00:44] thoughts because you never gave yourself
[00:00:45] the opportunity to clean it up when I
[00:00:47] stopped trying to make it perfect first
[00:00:49] go that's when I started really becoming
[00:00:52] more efficient


=== The benefits of being lazy ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hR6Edwn0hs

[00:00:00] ever since I moved to using a Macbook
[00:00:02] instead of a my old Windows PC I
[00:00:05] basically stopped gaming on my computer
[00:00:07] altogether I just couldn't be bothered
[00:00:09] unplugging my MacBook and then plugging
[00:00:10] my computer in and like connecting up to
[00:00:12] the Monitor and everything and then
[00:00:13] turning it on just to play some games so
[00:00:14] I stopped I effectively became too lazy
[00:00:18] to procrastinate think about that


=== Stop pretending to be smart! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Cy8S3wSDbk

[00:00:00] if you have low deep processing and you
[00:00:02] use these techniques that lots of high
[00:00:05] Achievers are using and then you don't
[00:00:07] do well which is statistically most
[00:00:10] people then you can conclude that you're
[00:00:12] not smart enough or you are just
[00:00:15] incapable which is sad and untrue


=== Stop trying to copy the best students ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6J9MziSXpE

[00:00:00] most high Achievers are also not
[00:00:01] experienced learning coaches so what
[00:00:04] worked for them doesn't necessarily
[00:00:06] transfer to someone else this is one of
[00:00:08] the reasons why I always say take advice
[00:00:09] from people that have had personal
[00:00:11] success and have been able to replicate
[00:00:13] that success in other people again just
[00:00:15] because you are a terrific athlete
[00:00:17] doesn't necessarily mean that you're a
[00:00:18] good coach


=== Can you learn to be a genius? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmO8QOg1YOY

[00:00:00] think of a genius that you know or have
[00:00:02] heard of what you are thinking about is
[00:00:04] probably deep processing deep processing
[00:00:06] is the ability to think critically make
[00:00:09] connections between ideas extract
[00:00:11] meaningful learning from information and
[00:00:14] understand complex Concepts most people
[00:00:15] with deep processing are high Achievers
[00:00:18] and they have high deep processing
[00:00:20] because of a combination of genetics and
[00:00:22] childhood experiences here's the
[00:00:24] important part of deep processing though
[00:00:25] deep processing can be trained your
[00:00:28] brain has this thing called neuroplastic
[00:00:30] which is the ability for it to mold and
[00:00:31] adapt based on the pressures that you
[00:00:33] put on it that's how we form new habits
[00:00:35] deep processing is just a series of
[00:00:38] habits related to learning and they can
[00:00:40] be trained not every person is going to
[00:00:42] become the genius but everyone can get
[00:00:45] better


=== What study advice should you follow? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9uaXRPv-pk

[00:00:00] people with high deep processing can use
[00:00:02] ineffective techniques and still do well
[00:00:05] this single fact is the reason why there
[00:00:08] is so much bad studying advice out there
[00:00:12] their raw processing power can
[00:00:14] compensate for their bad technique High
[00:00:17] deep processors don't need to use the
[00:00:20] most effective techniques a lot of the
[00:00:21] time especially when they're in high
[00:00:23] school or things are a little bit easier
[00:00:24] most natural high Achievers are doing
[00:00:27] well despite their techniques not
[00:00:30] because of them


=== After 5000 Hours of Mind Mapping, Here's What I've Learned... ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqxUExCZJ5Y

[00:00:00] I've made over 300 mind maps here's one
[00:00:03] of my first mind maps which is about
[00:00:05] half a Page worth of normal linear notes
[00:00:07] and here's a more recent one that I made
[00:00:08] for my masters which is equivalent to
[00:00:11] almost 100 pages of notes in this video
[00:00:13] I'm going to give you four secrets of
[00:00:15] effective mind mapping that took me over
[00:00:17] a decade to figure out and make sure to
[00:00:19] stick around to the end of the video
[00:00:20] because I'll explain how you can
[00:00:21] integrate the famous Fineman technique
[00:00:24] into your mind mapping to make it the
[00:00:26] most powerful learning tool you have in
[00:00:28] your aome so secret number one turn your
[00:00:32] mind maps into a mind mirror let me
[00:00:35] explain when I first started mind
[00:00:37] mapping I used to just treat it like
[00:00:39] normal note taking I read some stuff I
[00:00:42] listen to some stuff and then I just try
[00:00:43] to put it down onto my map I'm
[00:00:45] simplifying a few words I'm paraphrasing
[00:00:48] I'm shortening and abbreviating I'm
[00:00:49] adding some lines and arrows and places
[00:00:51] where I think things are connected and I
[00:00:53] thought that was pretty much it to my
[00:00:55] mapping pretty easy pretty useless I
[00:00:58] honestly didn't find find it very
[00:01:00] effective so I actually kind of stopped
[00:01:02] my mapping for a few years and then when
[00:01:04] I entered into medical school one of my
[00:01:06] friends in a lecture I noticed that they
[00:01:09] were mapping during a lecture and they
[00:01:11] said that they were finding it really
[00:01:12] effective and really useful and at this
[00:01:13] point I was like falling asleep in
[00:01:15] pretty much every lecture anyway so I
[00:01:16] was willing to give anything a go and
[00:01:18] this is also the point at which I was
[00:01:20] like really really heavily into just
[00:01:21] doing like lots and lots of flash cards
[00:01:23] and I was really seeing to start how
[00:01:25] overwhelming it can be and I was like
[00:01:27] trapped in this never ending flash card
[00:01:29] cycle so in the next lecture I decided
[00:01:31] to just try mapping it out instead so no
[00:01:34] more lecture slides that I'm annotating
[00:01:36] on no more ever note or one note or just
[00:01:40] like typing things out as I went it was
[00:01:42] kind of weird because I felt almost like
[00:01:44] naked it was just me my brain the
[00:01:48] lecture and a blank piece of paper it
[00:01:51] felt like all my my gear all my tools
[00:01:53] were like Stripped Away From Me and in
[00:01:56] the hindsight I think this really helped
[00:01:58] me because i' be sitting sitting there
[00:02:00] in the lecture and I'd be trying to
[00:02:01] create this myet but because the
[00:02:03] lecturer didn't really make it a
[00:02:06] priority to make the lecture more easily
[00:02:09] understandable I just didn't have time
[00:02:12] to write down absolutely everything like
[00:02:15] I was kind of more used to so I started
[00:02:16] cutting down the words that I was using
[00:02:18] to just the key words and I spent more
[00:02:21] time thinking about what is actually
[00:02:23] worth writing down and what is important
[00:02:26] enough that I want to write it down in
[00:02:27] the way that is the most efficient way
[00:02:30] possible and that's when I realized
[00:02:31] first of all how powerful a simple arrow
[00:02:34] can be at representing actually quite a
[00:02:37] complex relationship and also how with
[00:02:40] my previous notes a lot of the words I
[00:02:42] was writing weren't really helping my
[00:02:45] learning of it anyway in fact with less
[00:02:47] words it was getting easier because
[00:02:49] there were less things on the page for
[00:02:51] my brain to try to process through it
[00:02:54] meant that I could spend more time
[00:02:55] actually thinking about the ideas and
[00:02:57] how they connect together and less time
[00:02:59] just trying to read everything on the
[00:03:01] page and so even though it was actually
[00:03:03] a lot harder initially it got much much
[00:03:07] easier doing it this way than with my
[00:03:08] old technique and I would leave the
[00:03:10] lecture feeling like okay I actually
[00:03:13] understood most of the things they were
[00:03:15] explaining and for the first time I had
[00:03:17] you know like more questions I was able
[00:03:19] to think about a lot more deeply when I
[00:03:21] went to study I kind of had an
[00:03:24] understanding about which parts I needed
[00:03:25] to revise more versus which parts you
[00:03:27] know were relatively strong I had more
[00:03:29] of a clear Direction whereas before I
[00:03:31] would leave the lecture just being like
[00:03:33] well I'm going to have to study all of
[00:03:34] that all over again like pretty much all
[00:03:36] I did is attend the lecture and I would
[00:03:39] be you know like even more overwhelmed
[00:03:41] after the lecture than beforehand and
[00:03:42] also just like really tired despite the
[00:03:44] fact that I spent half the lecture
[00:03:46] sleeping so what does this all have to
[00:03:47] do with this concept of like a mind
[00:03:49] mirror well one of the things that I
[00:03:51] started realizing very early on was that
[00:03:53] because I was thinking so much about how
[00:03:55] to write it down in a way that actually
[00:03:57] makes sense the notes that I would was
[00:04:00] producing reflected my mind much more
[00:04:04] closely and so I could start visually
[00:04:07] seeing where there were gaps in my
[00:04:09] knowledge and where I struggled with if
[00:04:12] there was a problem on the map there was
[00:04:14] a corresponding problem in my mind in my
[00:04:17] own memory if it looked really messy and
[00:04:21] chaotic then that meant that it was also
[00:04:23] pretty messy in my brain too for example
[00:04:25] if you have a look at this map that I
[00:04:27] did relatively early on you can see that
[00:04:29] there are these parts here which look
[00:04:31] really really messy and yes all these
[00:04:33] ideas are connected to each other but if
[00:04:35] someone actually ask me to explain it
[00:04:37] and navigate those connections in a
[00:04:39] coherent way I'd get overwhelmed and I
[00:04:41] wouldn't know where to start whereas on
[00:04:43] the other hand if you have a look at
[00:04:45] this part of the same map where it just
[00:04:47] happened to look more clean and more
[00:04:49] organized and I remember I thought about
[00:04:52] it a little bit more to try to get it
[00:04:53] clean and organized then I was able to
[00:04:56] talk about this part and answer problems
[00:04:58] related to these things much more easily
[00:05:02] and it didn't matter what someone asked
[00:05:05] me about this I had a confidence with
[00:05:07] the topic that I could hit it from any
[00:05:09] angle and navigate it in any direction
[00:05:11] and as I slowly started to make my mind
[00:05:14] maps more clean and more organized and
[00:05:17] look at the messy things and then use
[00:05:19] that as an opportunity to clean that
[00:05:20] part up I started entering into exams
[00:05:23] where you'd have these curveball
[00:05:24] questions that used to make me think
[00:05:27] holy crap I've never seen this before
[00:05:29] before I've never thought about it this
[00:05:30] way before they never taught me this I
[00:05:33] started thinking of it like hm that's an
[00:05:36] interesting angle to explore I can make
[00:05:39] that work and I'd never been able to
[00:05:41] think about these types of questions
[00:05:43] with that mentality before but it really
[00:05:44] took years to embrace that part where I
[00:05:48] was willing to put down something on my
[00:05:50] mind map that wasn't that organized that
[00:05:54] wasn't that good I had this feeling that
[00:05:56] when I write it on my map it should be
[00:05:59] as perfect as possible so if you have a
[00:06:01] look at this m map that I did really
[00:06:03] really early on you can see that it
[00:06:05] looks really clean but it's clean
[00:06:08] because I just didn't put all the
[00:06:10] information on it because I knew that as
[00:06:11] soon as I tried to add more stuff it was
[00:06:13] going to get messy so it's not that it
[00:06:15] was more organized in my brain it's like
[00:06:17] I literally just avoided the part that
[00:06:19] made it more confusing which like I
[00:06:22] needed all of that knowledge anyway so
[00:06:24] the secret is don't do that if it's
[00:06:26] messy put it down use your map like a
[00:06:30] mirror put down what you're thinking add
[00:06:32] all the connections add all the arrows
[00:06:34] let it be messy and then when it's on
[00:06:37] paper you can look at it you can see the
[00:06:39] mistakes and the gaps for what it is and
[00:06:42] then you can start to progressively try
[00:06:44] to clean it up and reorganize it and
[00:06:47] when you don't avoid that when you look
[00:06:49] for the parts that are messy and you
[00:06:51] recognize that that means that that
[00:06:53] structure is not quite clear in your
[00:06:55] head it creates a really high yield
[00:06:58] focused area for your revision any area
[00:07:01] of a map that looks
[00:07:03] disorganized messy arrows or lines
[00:07:06] flying around everywhere or literally
[00:07:09] just like a whole Gap like there's just
[00:07:10] literally nothing there even though you
[00:07:12] know there should be something there
[00:07:14] maybe you just like missed that part of
[00:07:16] the topic these are areas that you
[00:07:19] should work on and being able to
[00:07:21] visually see it makes things so much
[00:07:25] more easy than trying to find your gaps
[00:07:28] through just like going over the same
[00:07:30] thing again and again hoping to find
[00:07:32] something that you missed or like just
[00:07:33] testing yourself with like 10,000
[00:07:35] practice questions which directly
[00:07:37] relates to secret number two never get
[00:07:40] it right on your first try you know how
[00:07:43] I said that if it's messy just put it
[00:07:44] down on paper and then try to organize
[00:07:46] it afterwards well I really mean it you
[00:07:48] see because of my type a typical like
[00:07:51] mid student personality and I had this
[00:07:54] perfectionism and I wanted to create the
[00:07:56] best mind map first try and you might
[00:07:59] have had this experience yourself but
[00:08:01] this is really really hard in fact I
[00:08:04] actually wonder if it's humanly possible
[00:08:07] for most topics I realized that there
[00:08:09] are usually so many Concepts and
[00:08:11] keywords and potential relationships
[00:08:13] that you can overload your brain within
[00:08:16] like minutes of thinking about it I
[00:08:18] can't even imagine trying to think about
[00:08:21] every single connection and pattern and
[00:08:23] every concept and create this like
[00:08:25] perfect knowledge schema of an entire
[00:08:27] topic first try without making any
[00:08:30] mistakes I actually don't think the
[00:08:32] human brain is capable of that level of
[00:08:35] processing what is infinitely more
[00:08:38] efficient and way easier is to just put
[00:08:41] your ideas down as hypotheses and just
[00:08:44] work and build on them as you go put
[00:08:47] down some words draw a few lines think
[00:08:50] maybe I could organize it like this or
[00:08:53] wonder if that makes sense or maybe I
[00:08:55] could do it like this wonder if that
[00:08:56] makes sense I don't know let me come
[00:08:58] back to it later read a little bit more
[00:09:01] add a few more words add a few more
[00:09:03] lines think does it make sense I don't
[00:09:06] know come back to it later like if you
[00:09:08] use your mapping as a cognitive offload
[00:09:12] so that it stops things from getting
[00:09:14] overwhelming and you can literally look
[00:09:16] at the ideas that you were thinking of
[00:09:18] and then refine them and when you think
[00:09:21] about it as everything you write down in
[00:09:23] the first go it's all going to be wrong
[00:09:25] like nothing in there is going to be
[00:09:27] perfect you're using it like a
[00:09:29] whiteboard like a scratch Pad so that on
[00:09:31] the fifth or sixth or seventh iteration
[00:09:35] of organization and thinking about it
[00:09:37] you can get it to a point where it's
[00:09:38] like accurate and really really good and
[00:09:40] flows and it's like super organized then
[00:09:43] that will be a win you're going to
[00:09:44] notice that you are way more engaged
[00:09:46] while you're reading or listening you're
[00:09:48] going to find that you're aware of
[00:09:50] knowledge gaps much earlier on you'll
[00:09:53] find that your memory is much deeper
[00:09:55] you'll find that your depth of
[00:09:57] understanding is more nuanced and for
[00:09:58] the same amount of time spent studying
[00:10:01] you will end up with a much more robust
[00:10:04] set of knowledge in the early days I
[00:10:06] used to try to get it right the first
[00:10:08] time and I used to think like maybe just
[00:10:11] by continuing to push to get it right
[00:10:13] the first time it's going to train my
[00:10:15] brain's ability to like process and
[00:10:17] think about it and then one day if I
[00:10:19] keep pushing at it I will get to a point
[00:10:21] where like my first my map first go is
[00:10:23] just like Immaculate so my first attempt
[00:10:26] is a lot better than I would have been
[00:10:27] able to do 10 years ago it is still
[00:10:30] impossible to get it right the first
[00:10:32] time and trying to do that always leads
[00:10:35] to something that is lower quality and
[00:10:39] just more time consuming it is a
[00:10:41] complete lose lose situation and I want
[00:10:44] you to compare that with something that
[00:10:45] is completely
[00:10:47] winwin for example liking this video
[00:10:51] when you like this video I win because
[00:10:53] this video reaches more people and you
[00:10:55] win because it means that I keep making
[00:10:57] videos for free every week you could
[00:11:00] even turn it into a triple win by
[00:11:03] subscribing anyway speaking of winning
[00:11:05] moves uh we've got secret number three
[00:11:07] which is never ever ever start
[00:11:13] organizing your ideas the same way it is
[00:11:17] presented to you now this is kind of a
[00:11:19] tricky one so listen carefully there's
[00:11:21] this cognitive bias called framing bias
[00:11:24] framing bias is basically your brain's
[00:11:26] tendency to judge later in information
[00:11:30] based on how it was presented or framed
[00:11:33] to you this is talked about a lot in
[00:11:36] fields like medicine where you know you
[00:11:38] could have a junior doctor say hey uh
[00:11:40] boss can you have a look at this patient
[00:11:41] they've got gastritis you know a bit of
[00:11:43] heartburn uh they coming in with you
[00:11:46] know pain you know like right here like
[00:11:48] above their stomach and they get this
[00:11:50] kind of like acid sensation in the back
[00:11:52] of their throat it's like a burning
[00:11:53] feeling coming up it's worse after they
[00:11:55] eat then that way of presenting the
[00:11:59] patient makes someone think okay yeah
[00:12:01] they've said hey boss I've got someone
[00:12:04] with heartburn and then they describe
[00:12:06] these things that sound like heartburn
[00:12:09] but it might not be it might be a heart
[00:12:10] attack it might be like an atypical
[00:12:13] presentation of a heart attack but you
[00:12:15] don't want to bias yourself into
[00:12:17] thinking yep it's heartburn and
[00:12:18] therefore miss the heart attack and this
[00:12:21] is the same thing when it comes to
[00:12:22] studying a lot of the time when you're
[00:12:24] taught something in lecture slides or
[00:12:26] like a textbook there are headings and
[00:12:28] sub headings and there's a certain
[00:12:30] organizational hierarchy that someone
[00:12:32] thought this is a logical way of
[00:12:35] teaching it to someone else every now
[00:12:37] and again you get lectures where you
[00:12:38] wonder like did they ever even think
[00:12:40] about what would be a logical way of
[00:12:41] teaching this to us but regardless you
[00:12:44] can't avoid the fact that when you're
[00:12:45] learning something you are consuming
[00:12:48] that information in someone else's frame
[00:12:52] and that's going to bias the way you
[00:12:53] think about it now the problem is that
[00:12:56] the way that it makes sense for you and
[00:12:58] the way way that you should organize it
[00:13:00] that makes the most sense for your brain
[00:13:02] is not always the same that's why you
[00:13:05] could have an expert teacher explain
[00:13:08] something to you but then when your
[00:13:09] friend explains it to you it actually
[00:13:11] clicks and makes sense a lot more easily
[00:13:13] it's more intuitive or you could read
[00:13:14] two books about the same topic but one
[00:13:16] book just explains it in a way that just
[00:13:18] feels so much more intuitive for you but
[00:13:21] maybe for another person they prefer the
[00:13:23] other book and it's not about how
[00:13:25] they're going to test or examine or how
[00:13:28] you need to use your knowledge either
[00:13:30] and that's a common thought you can
[00:13:32] learn something in a frame in an
[00:13:35] organizational structure that's not the
[00:13:37] same as how they're going to test you
[00:13:39] but if that's the way that makes more
[00:13:40] sense for your brain it's going to be
[00:13:42] easier for your brain to encode that
[00:13:44] information keep it in your memory and
[00:13:46] reinforce the pathways and once that
[00:13:48] knowledge is there you can then use that
[00:13:50] knowledge in whatever Direction and
[00:13:52] angle that you want you can make the
[00:13:54] knowledge fit how you need to apply it
[00:13:57] it's much less effective to try to force
[00:14:00] your brain to understand it in the way
[00:14:03] you need to apply it or how you're going
[00:14:05] to be tested if that's not a way that
[00:14:07] makes sense for your brain you're now
[00:14:10] going to be fighting against how your
[00:14:11] brain wants to learn it for the sake of
[00:14:14] meeting some marking criteria when it
[00:14:16] would actually be much faster to learn
[00:14:18] it the way your brain wants to that
[00:14:20] makes the most sense for your brain and
[00:14:22] then just manipulate that information
[00:14:24] more freely once you have legitimately
[00:14:26] better expertise and in some cases you
[00:14:28] can find an angle that hits both it is
[00:14:31] both better for the way you need to use
[00:14:33] your knowledge and it makes more sense
[00:14:34] for your brain a great example of this
[00:14:36] is one time when I was working in the
[00:14:38] emergency department as a student and I
[00:14:41] remember my senior pulled me aside and
[00:14:43] he was like okay tell me everything that
[00:14:45] you know about shock now shock in
[00:14:47] medical speak is basically when your
[00:14:48] body is like shutting down it's like a
[00:14:50] crisis mode and so I said okay well you
[00:14:52] know like a medical student I was like
[00:14:53] okay well there's five different types
[00:14:55] of shock and you know here are all the
[00:14:57] different you know types and there are
[00:14:59] these different examples for every
[00:15:00] single different type and then these are
[00:15:02] the different symptoms and the you know
[00:15:04] mechanisms for each of those subtypes
[00:15:05] and examples and then he was like okay
[00:15:07] okay that's enough like this too slow
[00:15:09] you don't have 5 10 minutes for every
[00:15:11] patient you see for you to like work
[00:15:13] through this checklist and then he pulls
[00:15:15] out a little piece of paper and he draws
[00:15:17] on it in like 45 seconds a very simple
[00:15:21] diagram of the human body and he was
[00:15:23] like think of the body like a pump tubes
[00:15:27] and organs and he showed me how all of
[00:15:30] the different examples that I was
[00:15:32] talking about before really cleanly can
[00:15:35] just be fit into this new framework of
[00:15:39] thinking about shock and after about a
[00:15:42] minute I started thinking this way of
[00:15:45] thinking about shock is so much easier
[00:15:49] than the way that I've been trying to
[00:15:50] learn it before which is how it was
[00:15:51] taught to me in my lectures and in my
[00:15:53] textbooks and it's not like it was some
[00:15:55] ridiculously like technical you know
[00:15:58] Advanced way way of thinking about it I
[00:16:00] could totally have just myself thought
[00:16:03] of a different way to repackage that
[00:16:05] material in a way that made more sense
[00:16:07] for me and I probably would have arrived
[00:16:09] at that same framework I just never
[00:16:13] bothered to I didn't realize it would
[00:16:15] help me and when I started thinking
[00:16:16] about it in this way my retention was
[00:16:18] bter I was able to use that information
[00:16:20] more freely like I could recall it much
[00:16:22] more quickly it just felt much more
[00:16:24] intuitive it was bitter in every way and
[00:16:26] I didn't have to just memorize
[00:16:28] everything like I was doing before it
[00:16:29] was the same amount of information just
[00:16:33] filed away in a different way and so
[00:16:35] here's the learning point if we start by
[00:16:38] assuming that the way something is
[00:16:40] presented to us is the right way to
[00:16:44] learn it and that's going to affect the
[00:16:46] way that we can organize the information
[00:16:48] and it's going to stop us from seeing
[00:16:50] potentially other Frameworks a lot of
[00:16:52] the time people will say well this
[00:16:55] method that they have taught me is
[00:16:56] really really logical it makes sense
[00:16:59] already how could there be any other way
[00:17:02] of learning it all I have to do is just
[00:17:04] take this and then memorize it but
[00:17:06] here's the thing if you need to memorize
[00:17:09] it in order for you to remember it it
[00:17:12] probably means it's not that intuitive
[00:17:15] it might be logical but there could be
[00:17:18] another way of thinking about it that is
[00:17:21] just as logical but more intuitive and
[00:17:24] you're never going to know until you
[00:17:26] deliberately look for it and I found
[00:17:28] that for most topics there is usually
[00:17:31] more often than not a way of repackaging
[00:17:35] the information to make it more optimal
[00:17:37] for your brain and for your memory so
[00:17:39] just for my personal experience or
[00:17:40] experience working with students here's
[00:17:42] a few examples of ways that things have
[00:17:44] traditionally been packaged and then how
[00:17:47] students have been able to repackage it
[00:17:49] in ways that made more sense for them so
[00:17:51] for something like history or historical
[00:17:53] events often things have been presented
[00:17:55] to them in a way that's like before
[00:17:58] during during and after but an
[00:18:00] alternative grouping might be something
[00:18:02] like drivers mechanisms and consequences
[00:18:06] which is again also very logical but
[00:18:08] potentially more intuitive depending on
[00:18:10] the topic for subject like medicine or
[00:18:13] Dentistry often things are presented
[00:18:14] like history examination investigation
[00:18:18] and management now the problem with this
[00:18:20] is that like every disease is presented
[00:18:22] in this way and so what becomes
[00:18:24] problematic is that because every single
[00:18:26] thing is like categorized the exact same
[00:18:29] way that categorization doesn't actually
[00:18:31] help you to remember the information
[00:18:33] like the the categories become
[00:18:35] meaningless because everything is
[00:18:36] categorized that way but in some cases
[00:18:38] for some diseases it might actually make
[00:18:40] more sense to divide it into something
[00:18:41] that's more like mechanisms or
[00:18:45] pathophysiology and then severity and
[00:18:48] then the management comes off as an
[00:18:50] example of how you treat anything that
[00:18:53] has that kind of mechanism and that
[00:18:56] level of severity and again these are
[00:18:57] just a couple of examples there's
[00:18:59] literally hundreds of different ways
[00:19:01] that you can package information and I
[00:19:04] think it is a pretty characteristic sign
[00:19:07] of a highlevel learner to be able to
[00:19:09] find a way of organizing information in
[00:19:12] a way that feels more intuitive for them
[00:19:14] and I'm not saying that you can't ever
[00:19:16] organize it in the same way that it was
[00:19:18] taught to you but I'm saying that if you
[00:19:19] do end up organizing it in the same way
[00:19:21] that should be an independent conclusion
[00:19:23] that you arrive at after you have really
[00:19:26] thought about it and have thought about
[00:19:27] Alternatives and as a quick TST if you
[00:19:29] look at how you've organized and grouped
[00:19:30] your information and you think I don't
[00:19:33] even know any other way to arrange this
[00:19:35] it probably means that you can think
[00:19:37] about it a little bit more after all you
[00:19:39] can't decide that something is the best
[00:19:41] way if you don't even know of any other
[00:19:43] ways and trust me there's always some
[00:19:45] other way now next up is our final
[00:19:47] secret but first a word from our sponsor
[00:19:50] yes that is again me most of the stuff
[00:19:53] that I talk about in all of my videos
[00:19:55] has been in my guided program for years
[00:19:57] it is a distillation of over a decade of
[00:20:00] my experience helping Learners become
[00:20:02] Ultra efficient in a stepbystep guided
[00:20:05] program we only need to spend like 20 30
[00:20:07] minutes every 2 or 3 days to take in
[00:20:09] some new Theory and techniques you then
[00:20:11] practice them throughout the week and
[00:20:13] you can get feedback within our
[00:20:14] community and our team of coaches making
[00:20:16] the program the best it can be is where
[00:20:18] the majority of my time and focus goes
[00:20:21] if you're interested you can check it
[00:20:22] out at i.com I'll put a link in the
[00:20:23] description and so finally secret number
[00:20:26] four which is to integrate the Fineman
[00:20:29] technique now the fan technique
[00:20:30] basically says that if you want to learn
[00:20:31] something you should try to explain it
[00:20:33] to a 10-year-old and there's a little
[00:20:35] bit more to it than that but this
[00:20:36] mindset complements mind mapping
[00:20:39] perfectly and the reason is because
[00:20:41] especially when we learn a new topic
[00:20:43] there's often a lot of new terminology
[00:20:46] and
[00:20:47] terminology is like vanilla Essence let
[00:20:50] me explain if you've ever opened up a
[00:20:52] bottle of vanilla Essence before you
[00:20:55] know that that stuff is potent you you
[00:20:58] know you literally put like a like a
[00:20:59] tiny little teaspoon of vanilla Essence
[00:21:01] to like vanilla flavor an entire Cake
[00:21:04] The Humble vanilla bean has been
[00:21:07] ruthlessly concentrated and extracted so
[00:21:10] that for just like a few drops of this
[00:21:14] Villar Ence you are getting like a
[00:21:16] concentrated bomb of flavor and that is
[00:21:18] exactly what terminology is when we
[00:21:21] learn a new piece of terminology it's
[00:21:24] not just a word or a couple of words it
[00:21:26] is an entire net work of ideas and
[00:21:29] relationships that were so complicated
[00:21:31] that someone decided we need a whole
[00:21:33] word just for it and so when we
[00:21:35] introduce new terminology into our mind
[00:21:38] maps or our notes it can overload our
[00:21:40] brain very easily and so one way that we
[00:21:42] can supercharge our mind maps is to
[00:21:44] deliberately use non-technical words
[00:21:47] that a 10-year-old could understand so
[00:21:49] for example let's say you're studying
[00:21:50] cell division and there's a phase and
[00:21:52] there it's called anaphase instead of
[00:21:53] writing anaphase you can just write away
[00:21:56] which is basically what happens in that
[00:21:57] phase and you can still have your
[00:21:58] terminology under it so you don't forget
[00:22:00] it you just have it in Brackets
[00:22:02] underneath but by taking a moment to
[00:22:04] turn that terminology into a simpler
[00:22:06] word not only do we deepen our
[00:22:08] understanding of that word by turning
[00:22:10] into something that we feel we're able
[00:22:12] to understand more intuitively which is
[00:22:14] like making a mini analogy we're also
[00:22:16] able to speed up our review of that
[00:22:19] information because our brain can spend
[00:22:21] more time thinking about the ideas and
[00:22:23] less time reading each piece of
[00:22:25] terminology and spending 10 15 seconds
[00:22:27] trying unpack exactly what that word
[00:22:29] meant and the reason this is secret
[00:22:31] number four is that if you actually just
[00:22:32] try to do this you'll realize that it's
[00:22:34] kind of impossible to do it properly
[00:22:36] without doing Secrets number one two and
[00:22:38] three first now I've told people to do
[00:22:39] mind maps with these methods for years
[00:22:43] and if you've tried mind mapping before
[00:22:44] and it wasn't really that good then try
[00:22:46] it again with these tips and I guarantee
[00:22:48] you you're going to have a completely
[00:22:49] different experience it will feel more
[00:22:51] challenging but that is your brain
[00:22:53] trying to figure things out that is your
[00:22:55] brain being active in the learning
[00:22:56] process and that's going to result than
[00:22:58] you having a better memory and a better
[00:22:59] depth of understanding challenging is
[00:23:02] good so give these tips a go I'm sure
[00:23:03] they're going to help thanks for
[00:23:05] watching and I'll see you next
[00:23:06] [Music]

=== Are you struggling at University? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKO5Fe1MxXQ

[00:00:00] I see this a lot with students going
[00:00:01] from high school to college or
[00:00:02] university where suddenly there's this
[00:00:03] very big jump from the amount of
[00:00:05] self-regulation they needed and then now
[00:00:07] there's more resources to manage the
[00:00:09] lectures are faster there's more Content
[00:00:11] Volume and there's just overall less
[00:00:13] Direction and therefore they need a
[00:00:15] greater self-regulation ability but they
[00:00:17] don't have it and then they start
[00:00:18] struggling


=== How to scheduling tasks for focus ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy5Dn00exDs

[00:00:00] and number six is Task timing the main
[00:00:03] idea is that you want to schedule tasks
[00:00:05] and events during your day when you know
[00:00:07] you're going to be more focused and
[00:00:08] effective for that task for example I
[00:00:10] like to do more deep work that requires
[00:00:12] a lot of concentration in the mornings
[00:00:13] and I try to do more menial time
[00:00:15] consuming but lower mental effort work
[00:00:18] during the evenings the only way that
[00:00:19] you can really figure this out though is
[00:00:20] to try it out yourself observe and
[00:00:23] experiment again this one is actually
[00:00:25] really helpful and if you can nail this
[00:00:27] one down then it does make a really big
[00:00:29] difference but I'm here a little bit
[00:00:30] lower because you can't always control
[00:00:32] this and even if you don't get this it's
[00:00:33] still possible to do really good focused
[00:00:35] work


=== Which learner type are you? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMmFCIcN_c8

[00:00:00] have you ever tried to copy something
[00:00:01] that some top student will do but then
[00:00:02] it just doesn't work for you or maybe
[00:00:04] you've heard those stories about those
[00:00:06] students that never seem to study but
[00:00:08] then they still get first place how do
[00:00:10] they do that are they just built
[00:00:12] different and if so what are you meant
[00:00:14] to do most of the time the answer lies
[00:00:16] in figuring out your learner type once
[00:00:19] you figure out your learner type
[00:00:20] improving is much smoother and this is
[00:00:23] not some weird horoscope thing the type
[00:00:26] of learner you are affects what you're
[00:00:28] good at what is holding you back and
[00:00:29] then therefore what is the thing that if
[00:00:31] you were to work on would make the
[00:00:33] biggest impact for your performance


=== Limit your visual distractions for better focus session ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R-f_nUShzg

[00:00:00] number seven is limiting your visual
[00:00:02] distractions seeing something
[00:00:04] distracting is distracting I usually try
[00:00:06] to position myself somewhere with a
[00:00:08] pretty nice view but there isn't
[00:00:09] anything specific that's too interesting
[00:00:11] that's going to distract me I like
[00:00:13] having a nice view because I can be
[00:00:14] working and then I can look up and gaze
[00:00:16] out into the distance which is something
[00:00:18] that I do when I think about things and
[00:00:19] I noticed that if I'm looking up and I
[00:00:21] see just a wall right in front of me or
[00:00:23] there is something in distracting that
[00:00:24] does pull me out of focus if I'm not
[00:00:26] able to position myself like that I can
[00:00:28] sometimes wear a hat with a hoodie
[00:00:30] Narrows my field of view that can help
[00:00:31] me if that isn't enough or you just
[00:00:33] don't want to do that then there's not
[00:00:35] really much more else that you can do
[00:00:37] and at this point I just have to deal
[00:00:38] with it and this is the reason why this
[00:00:39] doesn't rank so highly because the
[00:00:41] amount you can control this is somewhat
[00:00:43] limited and even if you can't control it
[00:00:45] it usually is not going to be as
[00:00:46] beneficial as the next items


=== How important is exercise for focusing ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txoMU4EqKvk

[00:00:00] imagine having deep focus and perfect
[00:00:03] flow every time you work in this video
[00:00:05] I'm going to teach you the methods that
[00:00:06] I use to consistently maintain Focus
[00:00:08] even when I'm tired and exhausted not in
[00:00:10] the right mood didn't get enough sleep
[00:00:12] surrounded by distractions whatever it
[00:00:14] is first off with number eight is diet
[00:00:16] and exercise I know certain foods make
[00:00:18] me feel bloated and exercise helps with
[00:00:20] my cognitive performance so when I'm
[00:00:22] super busy I try to find time to get
[00:00:25] regular exercise in over the years I've
[00:00:26] realized that when I skip exercise it
[00:00:28] just makes things worse but this Factor
[00:00:30] does have a limit in how helpful it is I
[00:00:32] think after a certain point you're not
[00:00:33] really getting many improvements anymore
[00:00:35] for example I think diet can be really
[00:00:37] overrated sometimes there are a lot of
[00:00:39] people that are obsessed with trying to
[00:00:40] find the perfect brain superfood but
[00:00:42] actually I don't really think that it
[00:00:45] makes that much of a difference and
[00:00:46] there's certainly not enough research to
[00:00:48] suggest that it does either so unless
[00:00:50] you're not exercising at all and your
[00:00:52] diet is completely whack this is
[00:00:55] probably going to be the lowest priority
[00:00:56] item on the list for you


=== You need to think about focus differently ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDW6u_An53M

[00:00:00] despite what your parents or your
[00:00:01] teachers might have told you in the past
[00:00:02] you can't just increase your focus by
[00:00:04] trying harder it doesn't work that way
[00:00:06] for example if someone slaps you in the
[00:00:09] face every 5 seconds it's probably going
[00:00:11] to be impossible to focus and this might
[00:00:13] seem like an extreme example which it is
[00:00:15] and I hope that's not happening to you
[00:00:16] but it does bring up an important Point
[00:00:19] Focus involves a lot of different
[00:00:21] factors some of these factors we can
[00:00:23] control in some of these factors we
[00:00:25] can't control having good focus in the
[00:00:27] real world where things are generally
[00:00:29] unpredictable is knowing which of these
[00:00:31] factors matter and knowing how we can
[00:00:33] control them


=== How to maximize your lectures ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB32f3xPG2c

[00:00:00] in the case of like University classes
[00:00:02] there are actually textbooks there are
[00:00:03] lecture slides there are course notes
[00:00:05] the references are there and there's
[00:00:07] heaps of them what's more important is
[00:00:09] that we are using the time we're
[00:00:11] spending on note taking to get the
[00:00:12] information in our brain cuz that's the
[00:00:15] thing that takes the longest time and if
[00:00:16] the information is not in our brain but
[00:00:18] it's in our notes we're then having to
[00:00:20] waste a lot more time so I talked to a
[00:00:21] lot of students that will spend like 2 3
[00:00:23] hours every day just writing notes and
[00:00:26] then at the end of that they don't know
[00:00:27] anything and what they'll say is well I
[00:00:29] haven't learned it yet I've just written
[00:00:31] the notes but it's like well you've just
[00:00:32] spend 2 to 3 hours of time invested in
[00:00:35] this activity like if you're going to
[00:00:36] spend 2 to three hours of time invested
[00:00:38] in this activity like wouldn't you
[00:00:39] rather get to the point where at the end
[00:00:41] of that you do actually know it as well
[00:00:44] as having it down


=== DON'T forget this step when creating mind maps ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0ZB4D-Mf8g

[00:00:00] the missing part is how quickly you're
[00:00:02] scrolling in and out when you're looking
[00:00:03] at things at a really really Zoomed In
[00:00:05] level it's hard to see the big picture
[00:00:07] so when you are zoomed in you put
[00:00:09] something down okay you've mapped out
[00:00:11] this thing you've mapped out this thing
[00:00:12] once you've mapped it out stop zoom out
[00:00:14] look at the whole picture how does what
[00:00:16] you just put in fit with the whole
[00:00:17] picture rearrange things if you need to
[00:00:19] okay now you can zoom back in Zoom back
[00:00:21] in figure out some more of the
[00:00:22] relationships okay now zoom out so you
[00:00:24] have to be constantly zooming in and out
[00:00:26] to see how what you're creating fits
[00:00:28] with the big picture otherwise what you
[00:00:30] end up with is you can have very dense
[00:00:32] networks of Connections in a very
[00:00:34] localized area but then when you
[00:00:36] actually look at the big picture it's
[00:00:37] actually very confusing and hard to
[00:00:38] follow because even though there are
[00:00:39] like these pockets of really
[00:00:41] well-connected things overall it's not
[00:00:44] well connected together so it's still
[00:00:45] quite a lot for your brain to try to
[00:00:47] hold into and and make sense of


=== This One Mistake Made his Mindmap Useless ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGwuihuuRJw

[00:00:00] I don't feel that my M actually helped
[00:00:02] me in answering the question the main
[00:00:04] thing for you to work on is doing that
[00:00:06] zooming in zooming out and then just
[00:00:08] taking a pause after you add on new
[00:00:10] keywords and Concepts to just give
[00:00:12] yourself more frequent opportunities to
[00:00:14] restructure your map before it gets to
[00:00:16] the point where it's already so
[00:00:17] committed that it's overwhelming and
[00:00:19] that makes sense every couple of months
[00:00:21] I find some members in our icon study
[00:00:23] program who are active and supportive in
[00:00:26] our community and I offer them some 30
[00:00:27] minute free coaching sessions some of
[00:00:30] you do seem to really like my coaching
[00:00:31] style content so I've decided to record
[00:00:33] some of these and post them on YouTube
[00:00:35] before we jump in I'd appreciate if you
[00:00:36] give this video a like and if you're
[00:00:38] interested in joining the full program
[00:00:39] yourself then you can check out iin
[00:00:41] study.com there's a link in the
[00:00:42] description I have ended High School
[00:00:45] currently I'm in army so is a compulsory
[00:00:48] service in Singapore so I'll will be in
[00:00:51] Army in two years and yeah so I'm
[00:00:55] currently waiting to go University the
[00:00:58] problem that I was having is uh first my
[00:01:01] retention wasn't that good for the uh my
[00:01:05] M then second um is like I just feel
[00:01:10] even if I refer to the my M I don't feel
[00:01:13] that my map actually helped me in any
[00:01:16] way in answering the question because
[00:01:19] the subject I'm doing is eons and is is
[00:01:23] a subject that is really in the link
[00:01:27] between like the concept
[00:01:31] can you can you show me an example of
[00:01:32] your my map uh so which one do you want
[00:01:35] to look you can look at the mro six
[00:01:38] first six okay yes at this first okay
[00:01:42] this one was really not it is kind of
[00:01:46] this one is better yeah it's better so
[00:01:50] this this map here and then you know
[00:01:53] like this map here as well as this one
[00:01:55] here are you saying that this didn't
[00:01:57] really help you and your retention on
[00:01:58] these was still low okay attempt seven
[00:02:01] was relatively better because I use
[00:02:05] important Bas junk I would expect this
[00:02:07] one your retention will be low and I
[00:02:09] expect that this one will help you very
[00:02:10] much yes it didn't it didn't help me at
[00:02:13] all I just when I see the my it makes
[00:02:16] sense but I just don't feel how it can
[00:02:19] help me in terms of so this one this one
[00:02:21] this one is wouldn't wouldn't help you
[00:02:23] that much because it's it's not just
[00:02:25] more things that need to be improved
[00:02:26] with this um but I would expect that
[00:02:29] this one and to some extent this one but
[00:02:33] especially especially this one and
[00:02:35] especially this one I expect that these
[00:02:37] two would be more helpful and that your
[00:02:39] retention for this these should be
[00:02:41] fairly high like this one especially I
[00:02:42] expect that your retention should be
[00:02:44] reasonably High yes this one is the
[00:02:46] highest for some for for some reason
[00:02:49] okay for some reason the DD the demand
[00:02:53] is this a later attempt uh or is this an
[00:02:56] earlier one this one is the later
[00:02:58] attempt this is later right yes the
[00:03:00] previous one in order in order of
[00:03:02] quality it's like this one this one
[00:03:05] is yeah and then after is like maybe
[00:03:08] this one is
[00:03:09] also and then this one is the next best
[00:03:12] and then this one is the best yeah but
[00:03:14] the latest is actually ma seven yes yeah
[00:03:19] this one's not bad though yeah this one
[00:03:21] the thing is uh but I think this one is
[00:03:24] not as good still yes because I was
[00:03:27] using like over 100 ke
[00:03:30] I think that was the problem yeah I was
[00:03:33] having some problem with the chumin yeah
[00:03:36] so if you I mean if you were to do it
[00:03:38] like okay when you're doing this attempt
[00:03:41] yes there are problems but your
[00:03:43] Technique has gotten better now so do
[00:03:44] you still have those same problems cuz
[00:03:46] you mentioned that the retention on the
[00:03:47] M map and also the M map wasn't helping
[00:03:49] in general is that still the case even
[00:03:51] with your new your better technique the
[00:03:54] retention are better and uh I can link
[00:03:58] the questions more yes then but it suff
[00:04:01] to me another another question another
[00:04:04] question is because I realize this was a
[00:04:08] incomplete M yeah this one is the only
[00:04:11] complet one is the other one that you
[00:04:14] you expect the best yeah yes this one is
[00:04:16] the only competed yeah so the main
[00:04:21] things that I see yeah you go the reason
[00:04:24] why that uh atemp seven was incomplete
[00:04:28] was I really cannot
[00:04:30] any more keywords any more keywords that
[00:04:33] I add in I feel I really feel is like
[00:04:36] it's overwhelming yeah is very
[00:04:38] overwhelming and I feel actually I feel
[00:04:41] this backbone is not the best yeah I I I
[00:04:43] still feel this backbone I can change
[00:04:45] but the back chang around five times
[00:04:49] already yeah that's that's quite normal
[00:04:51] especially if you're working with lots
[00:04:52] of keywords okay so there's a few things
[00:04:54] that I I I think is going on um one of
[00:04:57] the things that I noticed is that it's
[00:04:59] de It's relatively detail strip so what
[00:05:01] that means is that um it's it's using
[00:05:03] the biggest keywords but like for
[00:05:05] example this one especially it doesn't
[00:05:06] have really any of the like more
[00:05:08] technical detail and so there's probably
[00:05:10] like a whole level of information that
[00:05:13] you would need to know for an exam that
[00:05:15] isn't on this mind map that could be on
[00:05:17] this mind map but the thing that's
[00:05:18] stopping you from adding that on is
[00:05:20] probably this these two things here um
[00:05:24] which is the fact that your map is
[00:05:26] segmental um slightly segmental and
[00:05:29] there's also what we call anti- spider
[00:05:31] webbing so spider spider webbing happens
[00:05:33] when you have a flow and then you
[00:05:36] realize that there are more
[00:05:37] relationships that you than you thought
[00:05:39] of initially and then so you try to add
[00:05:41] those relationships on after you have
[00:05:44] already built the overall structure and
[00:05:47] then it starts looking like like this
[00:05:50] and so that's now spider webbing so anti
[00:05:54] and obviously this is it's quite messy
[00:05:55] it's hard to follow your retention on
[00:05:57] this is not going to be very good but
[00:05:59] anti- spider webbing is when you know
[00:06:01] that this will happen and so you just
[00:06:03] don't like you know that as soon as you
[00:06:05] try to do it that's it's going to be
[00:06:07] become messy and so you just don't even
[00:06:10] try that's anti- spider webbing both of
[00:06:12] them are not ideal so the way that we
[00:06:16] solve this by addressing the segmental
[00:06:18] part of it when we're mapping
[00:06:20] segmentally what this means is that
[00:06:21] we're focusing in on one area and we're
[00:06:24] developing it much more fully compared
[00:06:26] to the rest so that might end up looking
[00:06:29] like this it might end up looking yeah
[00:06:31] there'll be like quite a lot going on in
[00:06:34] just one area so that this part has been
[00:06:36] really fleshed out in a lot of depth
[00:06:37] however the other parts have been kind
[00:06:40] of neglected like all of this area here
[00:06:42] has been neglected so I can see this
[00:06:44] when I look at this one this top right
[00:06:46] corner is much more fully developed than
[00:06:50] basically everything else in here and so
[00:06:53] when you try to add more keywords you
[00:06:55] might be wanting to add something over
[00:06:57] here right by domestic and come you
[00:06:59] might want to add something here and
[00:07:01] then something here and then maybe
[00:07:02] something here and something here but
[00:07:03] you know that when you add something
[00:07:05] here that's now going to relate to stuff
[00:07:07] that's over on this side and then that
[00:07:08] that's going to cause those arrows to
[00:07:10] cross and it's going to become very
[00:07:11] messy the problem is not adding more
[00:07:14] keywords and seeing that the
[00:07:16] relationships are there it's good that
[00:07:17] you can see the relationships the
[00:07:19] problem was that you feted out this
[00:07:21] whole thing to this level before adding
[00:07:23] any of that here right so the difference
[00:07:26] is like this if you if you do what you
[00:07:29] you've done and this is very common by
[00:07:31] the way so this is all very normal it's
[00:07:32] not like you did something wrong it's
[00:07:33] just this is like a normal mistake that
[00:07:35] everyone has to make when you do it this
[00:07:37] way this is what happens with the Mind
[00:07:39] map you end up going through and saying
[00:07:43] okay well here's you know kind of like a
[00:07:44] basic backbone that I'm creating this is
[00:07:46] the overall structure of the topic great
[00:07:49] and then we start adding on the extra
[00:07:52] level of depth and so we say okay well
[00:07:53] that's kind of split up like this and
[00:07:55] then this and then that's split up like
[00:07:57] this and then that and then this is
[00:07:58] split up like into these three things
[00:08:00] here and then this one is split up again
[00:08:02] and then these two relate to each other
[00:08:03] and these relate to each other like that
[00:08:05] and so you look at that and you think
[00:08:06] okay good I'm happy with that that looks
[00:08:08] good and then if we move on to this this
[00:08:10] bottom one if we move on to this one now
[00:08:13] and then we start fleshing that out we
[00:08:14] start say okay well this one has got
[00:08:16] this and this one has got this and then
[00:08:18] these two are related and then if I
[00:08:20] flesh this one it's like okay well
[00:08:22] there's more here but then this one is
[00:08:23] related to this one and then this one
[00:08:25] but then this one is actually related to
[00:08:27] like this one and then there's this one
[00:08:29] but then this one is actually related to
[00:08:30] like this one over here so straight away
[00:08:33] we run into like a an issue it's it's
[00:08:35] now already too messy and that's just
[00:08:37] from adding one extra concept right as
[00:08:40] we add more and more and more it just
[00:08:42] becomes even even even more crazy and
[00:08:44] the reason is because there's just too
[00:08:46] much density there's just too much
[00:08:48] density in this area compared to the
[00:08:51] rest of it so here's what you should do
[00:08:53] instead okay so the first thing that you
[00:08:55] did was you worked out that General
[00:08:56] basic backbone you were like this and
[00:08:58] then that is like this that's fine that
[00:09:01] looks good you're happy with that this
[00:09:03] is fine this is all good the next step
[00:09:05] is like okay so what are the main
[00:09:06] Concepts that come off of this you then
[00:09:08] add those on across all of them you then
[00:09:11] ask are are any of these related to each
[00:09:14] other and you might think okay well
[00:09:16] these are actually related to each other
[00:09:18] and then this is related to this one so
[00:09:20] straight away we know that even without
[00:09:22] fleshing it out further we might need to
[00:09:25] change this up so we would stop here and
[00:09:28] we would then take this Unity to redo it
[00:09:30] so we would go back we might rearrange
[00:09:33] this so that instead it now looks like
[00:09:41] this right so we just created a little
[00:09:43] bit more space for ourselves and you can
[00:09:45] see that already the structure is going
[00:09:46] to change and then now we can add on you
[00:09:48] know some of the other ones and you say
[00:09:50] okay how are they related and that might
[00:09:51] be fine and then you add on the next
[00:09:53] level so we say okay well what is the
[00:09:55] very next level so there's a couple
[00:09:57] things here there's a couple things here
[00:10:00] this one's just got a few more details
[00:10:02] and every single extra thing that we add
[00:10:04] on we always think how is that related
[00:10:07] the rest how does that fit into the big
[00:10:09] picture so as soon as you add on this
[00:10:11] one you think okay how how does that
[00:10:13] relate to the big picture okay that's
[00:10:15] fine this is this is as good as it gets
[00:10:17] there's no other relationships we add
[00:10:18] another one on here how is that related
[00:10:20] okay now we see that this one is
[00:10:22] actually related to this one here okay
[00:10:23] we can draw that Arrow that's fine we
[00:10:26] add another one how is that related to
[00:10:27] the big picture okay we now see that
[00:10:29] this one is potentially related to this
[00:10:31] one that becomes a problem so we take a
[00:10:33] we take a pause and then we rearrange so
[00:10:36] maybe what I can do is I can move I can
[00:10:39] move this one somewhere around uh maybe
[00:10:43] I can move this one like all the way
[00:10:45] over here so that this Arrow ends up
[00:10:47] being a little bit cleaner like this yes
[00:10:49] we're still going to have a Crossing but
[00:10:51] it's still going to be much cleaner than
[00:10:52] it is now so in order for me to do that
[00:10:54] I need to reposition this thing so let's
[00:10:57] do that so I might add this one on
[00:11:00] something that looks like this instead
[00:11:02] and that allow that allows me to draw a
[00:11:04] connection like that which is a little
[00:11:06] cleaner so every new element that's
[00:11:08] added we're constantly rearranging if we
[00:11:11] delay the rearranging process for too
[00:11:14] long starts to get overwhelming cuz now
[00:11:16] there's like so many things to move
[00:11:18] around it's almost like you can almost
[00:11:20] think of it like if you've got a a new
[00:11:23] house and you're moving all your
[00:11:25] furniture into it it makes more sense to
[00:11:28] rearrange the room and think about
[00:11:30] everything for each new piece of
[00:11:32] furniture you put in because if you
[00:11:34] already put all the furniture inside the
[00:11:36] house and then you think you want to
[00:11:37] rearrange it it's more complicated cuz
[00:11:39] now you have to like move all these
[00:11:41] other things out of the way and that
[00:11:42] takes much more time and much more
[00:11:44] effort and it's it's just more
[00:11:45] overwhelming so instead it makes much
[00:11:47] more sense to re-evaluate constantly as
[00:11:50] you go to avoid it so if we were to look
[00:11:52] at the uh the map that you that you
[00:11:54] initially sent through like this one
[00:11:57] what it looks like is probably you
[00:11:59] created your overall backbone first with
[00:12:01] this one this flow here and this
[00:12:03] backbone flow is like it yeah maybe it
[00:12:06] can be better but it's like it's not
[00:12:07] terrible it's it's it's not bad and then
[00:12:10] after that maybe what you did is you
[00:12:11] added these ones these kind of blue
[00:12:14] lines in first and then afterwards you
[00:12:17] added in all these black ones here but
[00:12:19] the thing is when you added these black
[00:12:20] ones you should also be thinking how
[00:12:23] does that relate to all these other blue
[00:12:25] ones whereas I think what happened is
[00:12:27] that when you started adding these on in
[00:12:29] the top right you only thought about how
[00:12:31] it creates a network in this space you
[00:12:34] didn't think about how it might relate
[00:12:35] to the other things that are that are
[00:12:38] that are on here so if you were to like
[00:12:41] add you know for example like
[00:12:42] technological advancement which is right
[00:12:44] here in the top right and you think well
[00:12:46] how is that going to be potentially
[00:12:48] related to domestic income or foreign
[00:12:50] income that means that you're given
[00:12:52] yourself an earlier opportunity to
[00:12:55] rearrange the flow yeah it makes a lot
[00:12:57] of sense because what happened to me
[00:12:59] during the my mind being is okay let's
[00:13:02] use the technological advancement
[00:13:04] concept also it's like I is I'm
[00:13:07] basically doing inp the web in a way
[00:13:10] that I don't think about the
[00:13:12] relationship between like technological
[00:13:14] advancement to income I just actually
[00:13:17] how I think of it is since it branches
[00:13:20] out technological advancement so I was
[00:13:23] thinking maybe that means that uh the
[00:13:26] technological advancement is really Rel
[00:13:28] at to income uh in terms of production
[00:13:33] which actually is it is logically
[00:13:37] logically speaking it is that way that's
[00:13:40] why I didn't think yeah the idea here is
[00:13:42] that it it it logically makes sense
[00:13:44] technological advancement is related to
[00:13:47] income because it affects production yes
[00:13:50] like that that that does make sense
[00:13:52] that's perfectly valid and I'm not
[00:13:53] saying don't have it that way but it's
[00:13:55] about it's about exploring more more
[00:13:59] relationships and then coming to a
[00:14:00] judgment about how you want to express
[00:14:02] them it's not just like find one that
[00:14:05] makes sense it's find like there's
[00:14:07] usually multiple ways that things can be
[00:14:09] connected to other things there are
[00:14:10] multiple ways that things can make sense
[00:14:13] and we want to understand more than one
[00:14:15] of those ways so that we are aware of
[00:14:18] aware of the possible Network that it
[00:14:20] can form because like this technological
[00:14:24] advancement will definitely be related
[00:14:26] to some of these other Concepts as well
[00:14:30] now whether it's important enough that
[00:14:31] you want to actually put it in your map
[00:14:32] that's another story but you do at least
[00:14:35] want to think about it and I often talk
[00:14:38] about this idea of like zooming in and
[00:14:40] out very often zooming in and out very
[00:14:43] often by the way I just want to mention
[00:14:45] for your stage your current skill level
[00:14:49] is fine like all the problems that
[00:14:50] you're facing this is completely normal
[00:14:53] and expected at your level and you will
[00:14:55] probably just naturally learn to
[00:14:58] overcome this as well as you progress
[00:14:59] through the program cuz now we're
[00:15:00] getting into some nuances the missing
[00:15:02] part is how quickly you're scrolling in
[00:15:05] and out like when you're here when
[00:15:06] you're looking at things at a really
[00:15:08] really Zoomed In level it's hard to see
[00:15:10] the big picture so when you are zoomed
[00:15:12] in you put something down okay you've
[00:15:14] mapped out this thing you've mapped out
[00:15:16] this thing once you've mapped it out
[00:15:18] stop zoom out look at the whole picture
[00:15:21] how does what you just put in fit with
[00:15:23] the whole picture rearrange things if
[00:15:24] you need to okay now you can zoom back
[00:15:27] in Zoom back in figure out some more of
[00:15:29] the relationships okay now zoom out so
[00:15:32] you have to be constantly zooming in and
[00:15:34] out to see how what you're creating fits
[00:15:37] with the big picture right otherwise
[00:15:39] what you end up with is you can have
[00:15:41] very dense networks of Connections in a
[00:15:43] very localized area but then when you
[00:15:47] actually look at the big picture it's
[00:15:48] actually very confusing and hard to
[00:15:49] follow because even though there are
[00:15:51] like these pockets of really well
[00:15:53] connected things overall it's not well
[00:15:56] connected together so it's still quite a
[00:15:58] lot for for your brain to try to hold
[00:15:59] into and and make sense of the reason
[00:16:01] this one is better is because at a big
[00:16:04] picture level the connections are
[00:16:06] clearer but I suspect that the reason
[00:16:08] this one is better is because the topic
[00:16:11] was just naturally easier it was just
[00:16:14] naturally more organized and more well
[00:16:17] categorized and there's probably just
[00:16:19] less connections between some of these
[00:16:21] peripheral things that you need to think
[00:16:22] about and your backbone just is a lot
[00:16:25] more intuitive to begin with that's
[00:16:27] probably the reason why this one ends up
[00:16:29] being clearer whereas this one just ends
[00:16:32] up being a little bit more complicated
[00:16:34] cuz there's just more nuanced
[00:16:35] relationships and again that's normal
[00:16:37] and it just means that your skill level
[00:16:39] needs to just catch up to that the main
[00:16:41] thing for you to work on is doing that
[00:16:44] zooming in zooming out and then just
[00:16:46] taking a pause after you add on new
[00:16:49] keywords and Concepts to think how does
[00:16:51] that relate to the big picture so just
[00:16:53] give yourself more frequent
[00:16:55] opportunities to restructure your map
[00:16:57] before it gets to the point where it's
[00:16:59] already so committed that it's
[00:17:00] overwhelming I think this may be a small
[00:17:03] reason but the thing is when I see like
[00:17:07] when you stream on live clinic or when
[00:17:10] you when other coaches like Draw My Life
[00:17:14] demonstration I realize when you dra my
[00:17:16] you will be actually quite a zoom out
[00:17:18] yeah you will be quite zoom out but for
[00:17:20] me uh like just now you will showing
[00:17:22] like the concepts the technological
[00:17:25] advancement that's actually the whole
[00:17:28] thing I can see on my screen when I was
[00:17:31] yeah when I was doing ke like my my P so
[00:17:34] is it that I just have to deal with this
[00:17:37] for this app because yeah if I this is
[00:17:41] part of the skill yeah this this is what
[00:17:43] I'm saying is that actually the act of
[00:17:44] literally just deliberately taking time
[00:17:47] to pause zoom out reconnect Zoom back in
[00:17:50] zoom out zoom in zoom out zoom in zoom
[00:17:52] out right and that's not literally like
[00:17:54] just pinching but it's mentally as well
[00:17:56] thinking detailed thinking big thinking
[00:17:58] detailed thinking big that is part of
[00:18:01] the skill when you've got lots of
[00:18:03] keywords lots of Concepts to try to work
[00:18:05] with you need to do this more frequently
[00:18:07] if it's a very small topic there's not
[00:18:09] much consequence you can stay zoomed in
[00:18:11] for a very long time very detailed and
[00:18:13] when you zoom out there's only like two
[00:18:14] other Concepts you need to connect it to
[00:18:16] it's not too hard but if you've got like
[00:18:18] 40 different things to connect it to
[00:18:20] then by the time you've already mapped
[00:18:21] out one part in detail and you look at
[00:18:23] the big picture you might realize okay
[00:18:26] well you've just missed like all these
[00:18:27] other connections now you'd have to undo
[00:18:29] what you've just done to try to make it
[00:18:31] fit which is just you know like an
[00:18:33] ineffective use of time yeah I yeah I
[00:18:36] can completely understand it yeah I I
[00:18:39] will go and try more because actually if
[00:18:42] you see my keywords the keywords that I
[00:18:46] choose some of them are actually
[00:18:49] relationships like the consequences the
[00:18:51] advantages I will just bring you all the
[00:18:54] key I think that is actually just my
[00:18:57] problem of going too much into details I
[00:19:00] think I think you can I don't think you
[00:19:01] need to collect quite as many keywords
[00:19:03] in the first part I think working with
[00:19:06] like 100 keywords when you're still just
[00:19:08] learning the skill is a bit too much I
[00:19:10] would recommend maybe dropping it down
[00:19:12] to like 30 or even 50 is manageable you
[00:19:16] won't miss anything because you're going
[00:19:18] to come back to it anyway you're not
[00:19:20] skipping the keyword you're just
[00:19:22] delaying it you're just you're just
[00:19:24] partitioning your time differently
[00:19:26] you're saying these are the keywords I'm
[00:19:27] going to work on now and these are
[00:19:28] keyword I'm going to work on later like
[00:19:29] what you can do is you can create a list
[00:19:30] of keywords and then you can create a su
[00:19:32] list of keywords you can look at your
[00:19:34] big list and then pull out the ones that
[00:19:36] you think are more important and make a
[00:19:37] separate
[00:19:38] list right skipping information does not
[00:19:42] mean you're actually skipping it it just
[00:19:44] means that you're being more deliberate
[00:19:46] about when you learn it the thing that
[00:19:48] should create more uncertainty is if you
[00:19:50] feel like you're covering it just
[00:19:53] because you've got it down when actually
[00:19:56] you haven't learned it properly like
[00:19:58] that's the real skip right cuz now you
[00:20:00] think you've studied it but it's not in
[00:20:01] your memory anyway like if you this is
[00:20:04] what we see with people when we they
[00:20:05] just like read and reread and rewrite
[00:20:07] their notes all the time like yes
[00:20:08] they're reading and writing everything
[00:20:10] they're not missing anything but
[00:20:12] actually everything is being missed cuz
[00:20:13] none of it staying in the memory so we
[00:20:15] just got to shift our Focus that that
[00:20:19] makesense cool all right good luck um
[00:20:22] we'll keep in touch anything any any
[00:20:24] final remarks or
[00:20:27] questions you just yeah it's a very full
[00:20:30] session yeah cool awesome thank you so
[00:20:33] much um and yeah we we'll be in touch
[00:20:36] okay thanks see you later thank you

=== Why students make this common mind map mistake ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk6Vu0pYkAQ

[00:00:00] when we're mapping segmentally what this
[00:00:01] means is that we're focusing in on one
[00:00:04] area and we're developing it much more
[00:00:06] fully compared to the rest you end up
[00:00:08] going through and saying okay well
[00:00:10] here's you know kind of like a basic
[00:00:11] backbone that I'm creating this is the
[00:00:13] overall structure of the topic and then
[00:00:15] we start adding on the extra level of
[00:00:17] depth so we say okay well that's kind of
[00:00:18] split up like this and then this and
[00:00:20] then that's split up like this and then
[00:00:21] that and then this is split up like into
[00:00:23] these three things here and then this
[00:00:24] one is split up again and then these two
[00:00:26] relate to each other and these relate to
[00:00:28] each other like that and so you look at
[00:00:30] that and you say okay good I'm happy
[00:00:31] with that that looks good and then if we
[00:00:33] move on to this bottom one if we move on
[00:00:34] to this one now and then we start
[00:00:36] fleshing that out we start saying okay
[00:00:37] well this one has got this and then this
[00:00:38] one has got this and then these two are
[00:00:40] related if I flish this one it's like
[00:00:42] okay well there's more here but then
[00:00:43] this one is related to this one and this
[00:00:45] one but then this one is actually
[00:00:46] related to like this one but then this
[00:00:48] one is actually related to like this one
[00:00:49] over here so straight away we run into
[00:00:51] like an issue it's now already too messy
[00:00:53] and that's just from adding one extra
[00:00:55] concept as we add more and more and more
[00:00:57] it just becomes even more crazy


=== Two mind map mistakes you NEED to avoid ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i3keDeuQ9M

[00:00:00] spider weing happens when you have a
[00:00:01] flow and then you realize that there are
[00:00:04] more relationships than you thought of
[00:00:06] initially and then so you try to add
[00:00:08] those relationships on after you have
[00:00:09] already built the overall structure and
[00:00:12] then it starts looking like this and so
[00:00:14] that's now spider webbing and obviously
[00:00:16] this is it's quite messy it's hard to
[00:00:18] follow your retention on this is not
[00:00:20] going to be very good anti- spider
[00:00:21] webbing is when you know that this will
[00:00:23] happen and so you just don't like you
[00:00:25] know that as soon as you try to do it
[00:00:27] it's going to become messy and so you
[00:00:28] just don't even try that's anti spider
[00:00:30] webbing both of them are not ideal


=== Why your exam results should NOT be surprising ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAzaosZqhYg

[00:00:00] when I was in high school and even early
[00:00:01] uni I would study lots and lots and lots
[00:00:04] but I never really entered into an exam
[00:00:06] feeling confident either and studying
[00:00:09] more didn't necessarily mean that I was
[00:00:10] going to do better when I got an exam
[00:00:12] result back if I did well I'd just be
[00:00:14] like okay I must have done well and then
[00:00:16] if I didn't then I didn't really know
[00:00:17] what to do with that like I didn't know
[00:00:19] what to change to actually make me bit I
[00:00:21] just thought okay I got to try harder
[00:00:23] whatever that means but then what I
[00:00:25] realized was that the exam result should
[00:00:28] just be thought of as the fin final
[00:00:30] symptom of your learning you should
[00:00:33] really know what result you're going to
[00:00:35] get in that exam before you enter into
[00:00:37] it and the key that allowed me to do
[00:00:39] that was to start testing myself
[00:00:42] regularly and objectively I set a
[00:00:44] schedule to test myself and find my Gap
[00:00:47] and if I make a mistake so be it make
[00:00:49] the mistake put it out there in the open
[00:00:51] if I'm struggling with answering a
[00:00:52] question I'm not looking at the answer
[00:00:54] sheet I'm just going to make the mistake
[00:00:55] and see it for what it is


=== What is pre-structural knowledge? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFfmtNRWHNU

[00:00:00] so prestructural knowledge is the
[00:00:01] simplest knowledge that you can have
[00:00:03] it's just like very simple fact that
[00:00:04] you've memorized very superficially
[00:00:06] you're not really able to even explain
[00:00:08] what it means you've kind of just like
[00:00:10] embedded it in your mind I don't know if
[00:00:11] you're aware of this meme it says the
[00:00:13] mitochondria is the PowerHouse of the
[00:00:15] self it's a very common thing that's
[00:00:16] that that people write everywhere that's
[00:00:18] because when they were very young they
[00:00:19] just memorized this in their science
[00:00:20] class they don't already know what it
[00:00:22] means they can't really explain it they
[00:00:23] just memorize that sentence that would
[00:00:25] be prestructural very isolated very
[00:00:27] fragmented obviously not at the level of
[00:00:29] a high ition some ideas what level do
[00:00:31] you think that would be if you had
[00:00:33] prestructural knowledge only what do you
[00:00:35] think that would be roughly equivalent
[00:00:37] to just yell out a few ideas
[00:00:39] prestructural is actually the level that
[00:00:41] you normally get when you're in early
[00:00:43] childhood education right so this is
[00:00:45] like you're passing when you are six
[00:00:47] seven years old right you're just
[00:00:48] learning very very basic things like
[00:00:50] this is a table that is a chair like
[00:00:53] that that's the level that PR structural
[00:00:54] is very very simple


=== Be critical about EVERYTHING you learn ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv9azQbyeFw

[00:00:00] one of the big mistakes that I made with
[00:00:02] how I changed my learning system was I
[00:00:05] really underestimated how important it
[00:00:07] is to kind of be a bit of a prick while
[00:00:09] you're learning and the reason you need
[00:00:11] to be kind of a prick about it is
[00:00:12] because it's almost impossible to build
[00:00:15] a good foundation of knowledge without
[00:00:17] being Ultra Ultra critical about what
[00:00:20] you learn like you have to challenge
[00:00:22] everything that you consume you don't
[00:00:24] just take a factor or a concept and say
[00:00:25] yes it's been taught to me like that's
[00:00:27] how it is you have to actually go
[00:00:29] through the process C of questioning it
[00:00:31] and like factchecking it and like
[00:00:34] challenging it and looking for the
[00:00:36] answer having a conversation with
[00:00:38] someone if you are not forming your own
[00:00:41] independent evaluation and judgment
[00:00:43] about what you are learning you're
[00:00:45] missing out on some of the most
[00:00:46] important parts of learning and as soon
[00:00:48] as you start doing that you're going to
[00:00:50] see that your memory improves your depth
[00:00:51] of understanding improves and you can
[00:00:53] use that knowledge in much more complex
[00:00:55] ways


=== This simple habit will CHANGE the way you learn ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JncN8fc5aPU

[00:00:00] 30 minutes a day is all you need to
[00:00:02] start changing your life a lot of the
[00:00:05] time it is so easy to be caught up in
[00:00:07] just a day-to-day grind that we do not
[00:00:10] have the time and mental space to even
[00:00:13] think about how to change things and if
[00:00:14] we don't change those things then those
[00:00:16] changes will not happen and we might
[00:00:18] think well I don't even know what
[00:00:19] changes I need to make but the thing is
[00:00:21] that it takes time to discover what
[00:00:24] changes to make and we have to give
[00:00:26] ourselves that time and probably what
[00:00:28] you'll realize is that you don't need
[00:00:30] that much time to start unraveling some
[00:00:34] potentially really complex problems like
[00:00:36] if you sit there with a pen and paper
[00:00:38] thinking about the problems and how you
[00:00:40] feel and what you can do to try to
[00:00:42] create a little bit more alignment in
[00:00:44] your life one week at a time 30 minutes
[00:00:47] a day then I guarantee you you will be
[00:00:51] shocked at how much life can get easier
[00:00:55] after doing this for just like two or 3
[00:00:57] weeks


=== You should try nonlinear notes ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0ysN5x0Kn4

[00:00:00] all of you are writing notes right now
[00:00:01] hopefully if your notes are essentially
[00:00:03] left to right down the page stop writing
[00:00:05] notes that way I want you to start from
[00:00:07] now start experimenting with writing
[00:00:08] notes a little bit differently and the
[00:00:10] reason is because look at that extended
[00:00:12] abstract diagram that's what expert
[00:00:13] knowledge looks like that's where you
[00:00:15] want to get to that's not linear the
[00:00:16] knowledge in itself is not linear the
[00:00:19] only reason you're reading a book that's
[00:00:21] linear the only reason I have to teach
[00:00:22] it to you in a way that is linear is
[00:00:24] because I cannot simultaneously say 40
[00:00:26] sentences at the same time and then
[00:00:28] you're able to hear all 40 sentences and
[00:00:31] synthesize it if I could I would take my
[00:00:33] network of knowledge and just directly
[00:00:35] plug it into your brain but I can't so
[00:00:37] I'm forced to funnel it into this rigid
[00:00:40] linear structure your job as a learner
[00:00:43] especially postgraduate level is not to
[00:00:45] take linear information copy it into
[00:00:47] linear noes and learn it in that order
[00:00:49] your job is to look at that linear
[00:00:52] information and think how did the expert
[00:00:55] understand this what is the relationship
[00:00:57] what is the way that the information
[00:00:58] flows together


=== How to read a textbook ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHXv3KPuPo

[00:00:00] when you read a textbook there are
[00:00:01] chapter headings there are subheadings
[00:00:03] it's organized for you already you know
[00:00:05] it is organized when you learn it you
[00:00:07] are learning it in an organized
[00:00:08] structure still doesn't mean that you
[00:00:09] remembered it right it means that the
[00:00:10] organization was not meaningful it may
[00:00:13] be logical it may be meaningful for the
[00:00:14] author but for your brain from a
[00:00:16] cognitive architecture point of view it
[00:00:19] is not meaningful right and it's not
[00:00:20] going to be retained and here's the
[00:00:22] thing is that you don't have to store
[00:00:24] the information in the same way that it
[00:00:26] was presented to you what you should
[00:00:27] focus on is what is the way that I can
[00:00:29] store this information right now that is
[00:00:30] going to make it the most easily
[00:00:32] retained


=== Why are homework not useful for high achievers ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqS9A5g7eTs

[00:00:00] students that are really struggling
[00:00:01] essentially failing not doing any
[00:00:03] self-study at all homework is almost the
[00:00:05] only form of self-study that they're
[00:00:06] doing and so for them it's going to help
[00:00:08] however when you look at students that
[00:00:09] are already in a higher level of
[00:00:11] achievement band and I'm not even
[00:00:12] talking like top I'm just saying like
[00:00:13] above average there's no positive effect
[00:00:15] that's ever been demonstrated
[00:00:17] consistently from doing homework


=== This is exactly how to get top marks at university ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0Ij5e_7x0

[00:00:00] what defines the type of knowledge that
[00:00:03] someone that would have high distinction
[00:00:04] holds in their in their brain what
[00:00:06] characterizes the way an expert thinks
[00:00:09] about a topic and I want to talk about
[00:00:11] this thing here which is called solo
[00:00:12] taxonomy and it's very simple but it's
[00:00:15] very powerful because once you know what
[00:00:16] the features of an expert level
[00:00:19] knowledge look like it's much easier for
[00:00:21] you to actually work towards that rather
[00:00:22] than just vaguely trying to read deeper
[00:00:25] or be more critical you actually have a
[00:00:28] goalpost and sort of a checklist of
[00:00:29] things that you need to take off


=== How to deal with study anxiety ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NUS_EcCKEY

[00:00:00] did I study enough I hope this doesn't
[00:00:02] come up in the test where did I go wrong
[00:00:03] why didn't I do well who's had those
[00:00:05] thoughts before we end up living in fear
[00:00:08] of learning so Step One Is to learn how
[00:00:10] the engine works become the mechanic of
[00:00:11] your own brain this thinking about
[00:00:14] thinking is called metacognition and
[00:00:17] research shows that those with higher
[00:00:18] metacognition tend to do better and even
[00:00:20] if you're not doing better straight away
[00:00:22] you at least know how you can get better
[00:00:24] the more you learn the more control you
[00:00:25] have the less stress you get this builds
[00:00:27] confidence on the other hand if you have
[00:00:29] low metacognition just do whatever
[00:00:31] someone tells you to do this is probably
[00:00:32] the same thing that your friends are
[00:00:33] doing


=== Performance is predicable ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng1q6rH6ZBU

[00:00:00] performance is predictable there's some
[00:00:01] you know very fascinating research where
[00:00:03] they scan the human brain and they found
[00:00:06] that you can predict how good someone's
[00:00:08] memory and how good their ability for
[00:00:11] problem solving is going to be in the
[00:00:12] future based on just what their brain is
[00:00:14] doing at the moment they hear that
[00:00:16] information or they take that
[00:00:17] information for the first time it's very
[00:00:19] common you know when you go through uni
[00:00:20] or when you read something you'll read
[00:00:22] it and you'll be like okay I've got a
[00:00:23] general understanding of it but I'm
[00:00:24] going to go back through it later you
[00:00:26] know maybe a week from now I'll go
[00:00:27] through it and that's when I'm really
[00:00:28] going to like deepen my knowledge well
[00:00:30] it turns out it doesn't actually work
[00:00:32] that way the first time you went through
[00:00:33] it didn't really serve much of a purpose
[00:00:36] the learning actually only happened when
[00:00:38] you went through it so if you just do
[00:00:40] that same process the very first time
[00:00:42] you would not have to go through it
[00:00:43] again


=== The skills of a medical school graduate ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iEzTerSQ18

[00:00:00] when people think of a fifth year
[00:00:01] medical student or final year medical
[00:00:03] student they usually think like this
[00:00:04] person knows a lot right in reality a
[00:00:06] final year medical student knows just
[00:00:08] enough to not kill someone accidentally
[00:00:10] and even that is like on the fence
[00:00:12] sometimes you know just enough to know I
[00:00:14] need to get help and that's that's
[00:00:16] basically it and all the other learning
[00:00:17] is like done you know while you're
[00:00:18] working as a doctor


=== How I Ranked 1st at Monash University - 2 Mindset Shifts ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTigayP9Wg

[00:00:00] I wanted to finish my Master's at Mones
[00:00:02] University while working full-time but I
[00:00:04] also wanted to get the highest grades
[00:00:07] possible partly it's just a challenge to
[00:00:09] myself in the end after just a few weeks
[00:00:11] of studying I ranked first to my cohort
[00:00:13] and got the Deans award now I already
[00:00:14] made a video about some of the key
[00:00:16] strategies that I use which you guys
[00:00:17] really liked but there's something that
[00:00:19] I realized I didn't talk about which is
[00:00:21] something that I've been doing for years
[00:00:23] before even starting my masters which
[00:00:26] made everything just much easier so in
[00:00:28] this video I'm going to share two two
[00:00:30] major changes that I had made before
[00:00:32] even starting the year which made it so
[00:00:35] much easier to receive those types of
[00:00:37] grades because to be honest the first
[00:00:38] video that I made about this was pretty
[00:00:40] good I think but I also know that a lot
[00:00:43] of people if you followed it step by
[00:00:44] step would still struggle in some places
[00:00:46] and I want to talk about that at the end
[00:00:48] of the video I'll also include a bonus
[00:00:51] tip I should not do winking again if
[00:00:54] you're new to the channel welcome I'm Dr
[00:00:56] Justin s I'm a full-time learning coach
[00:00:58] and former medical doctor I'm the head
[00:00:59] of learning learning at I can study and
[00:01:01] for the last decade I have helped
[00:01:02] thousands of Learners from around the
[00:01:04] world learn to learn more efficiently
[00:01:06] now the first major change that I made
[00:01:08] years before I started my masters was to
[00:01:10] stop measuring my learning ability based
[00:01:13] on my grades and in retrospect this
[00:01:15] shift and mindset was actually
[00:01:17] life-changing back when I was in high
[00:01:18] school I didn't really know what I was
[00:01:20] doing I used to study a lot like every
[00:01:22] day after school I go to the library and
[00:01:24] I'd study there till 1 p.m. but I didn't
[00:01:27] really get a lot done I mean frankly I
[00:01:28] fell asleep probably every single day
[00:01:30] while studying my friends were there too
[00:01:32] so half of it was kind of studying and
[00:01:35] half of it was just chilling with
[00:01:36] friends feeling productive and I
[00:01:38] distinctly remember going through uni
[00:01:40] and feeling generally pretty confused
[00:01:43] about how to do well like back in school
[00:01:45] I could sort of just study a little and
[00:01:48] figure things out like it worked out for
[00:01:50] me and even though I did study a lot I
[00:01:52] can definitely say I probably didn't
[00:01:53] need to study that much again I don't
[00:01:55] even know if you could call that
[00:01:56] properly studying but in uni it wasn't
[00:01:58] quite the same like I wanted to have
[00:02:00] more of a social life I wanted to do
[00:02:03] reasonably well with my uni studies and
[00:02:05] my grades I didn't want to spend my
[00:02:07] whole uni life just trapped inside a
[00:02:08] library and socializing in a library is
[00:02:10] not exactly the most rewarding type of
[00:02:12] socialization either and initially I
[00:02:14] wanted to cut down on my studying hours
[00:02:16] without compromising my results but I
[00:02:18] just didn't know how cuz I didn't really
[00:02:20] know what was contributing to my results
[00:02:24] and this was really important to me for
[00:02:25] my masters because yes I wanted to
[00:02:27] finish it quickly because I was working
[00:02:29] full-time but
[00:02:30] also I wanted to make sure that the
[00:02:32] quality is there like the quality of the
[00:02:34] work matters it isn't just about speed
[00:02:36] there's no point doing it fast if it's
[00:02:37] crappy and I distinctly remember these
[00:02:40] pre-exam sessions during my undergrad
[00:02:43] degrees where I would be fighting
[00:02:46] against just a feeling of General
[00:02:48] uncertainty I didn't really know what
[00:02:50] enough studying was I never really felt
[00:02:53] confident going into exams there was
[00:02:55] just this general feeling of having
[00:02:57] studied enough and some sometimes I
[00:03:00] would reach that general feeling of
[00:03:02] enoughness or I just run out of time and
[00:03:05] I'd walk into an exam hoping for the
[00:03:06] best in fact there are some papers where
[00:03:09] I studied like very very little for it
[00:03:12] and for some reason got a better result
[00:03:14] than another paper where I studied way
[00:03:17] more so the hours of actual studying
[00:03:19] were definitely not well connected to
[00:03:21] the actual result that I was getting or
[00:03:23] there be like some exams where I get
[00:03:25] like a let's say like an 80% and then I
[00:03:27] double the amount of time that I study
[00:03:29] and then I get like a 85 it's like
[00:03:32] really 5% for like 100% more studying
[00:03:35] like that doesn't seem right and then
[00:03:37] eventually when I got my exam grades I'd
[00:03:39] say okay well I seem to have done
[00:03:42] reasonably well or or I didn't do quite
[00:03:44] as well but it was meaningless
[00:03:46] regardless cuz I don't know what to
[00:03:47] change I'd say something like well I
[00:03:49] better study harder next time or like
[00:03:52] try harder but like what does that even
[00:03:54] mean what does it even mean to try
[00:03:55] harder like just focus more like
[00:03:57] concentrate more I can tell you from
[00:03:59] personal experience as well as
[00:04:00] professional experience that doesn't
[00:04:02] really work and that's probably why it's
[00:04:05] actually relatively uncommon for most
[00:04:07] people to have an academic comeback
[00:04:09] people who consistently don't do well
[00:04:12] tend to carry on not doing very well
[00:04:15] unless they make a pretty major change
[00:04:18] and changing my perspective from
[00:04:20] measuring how good my learning is based
[00:04:21] on just my exam result is one of these
[00:04:25] major changes that completely shifted
[00:04:27] everything around so here's what I did
[00:04:28] and this is what I think you try to do
[00:04:30] as well I simply thought of exam results
[00:04:33] as a symptom and instead I made sure to
[00:04:36] test myself and get real objective
[00:04:39] feedback on my performance as frequently
[00:04:42] and as regularly as I could manage the
[00:04:44] thing that I realized was that when you
[00:04:47] hold off on really objectively testing
[00:04:49] yourself it makes it much harder to
[00:04:52] improve like you could spend weeks
[00:04:55] trying to get your knowledge to a point
[00:04:57] that you're really happy with but then
[00:04:58] when you test yourself you still have
[00:05:00] gaps and half the time you don't even
[00:05:02] know that those gaps existed because you
[00:05:04] never actually tested yourself and
[00:05:06] sometimes you wait so long to test
[00:05:08] yourself that gaps are appearing because
[00:05:11] you're forgetting more and more as you
[00:05:13] wait longer and longer before testing
[00:05:16] yourself and then you end up spending
[00:05:17] all of your other available time on just
[00:05:20] filling in those gaps and things that
[00:05:22] you forgot so now just like relearning
[00:05:24] the same thing again and again for weeks
[00:05:26] it is much much easier to use your time
[00:05:29] more effectively if you test yourself
[00:05:32] more regularly the mindset that I had
[00:05:34] was by the time I enter my exam I should
[00:05:38] already know what result I'm going to
[00:05:40] get and if you're entering exams like
[00:05:42] how I used to feel where I just felt
[00:05:44] like confused and uncertain and like
[00:05:46] hoping that they just wouldn't ask me a
[00:05:48] certain type of question that's just not
[00:05:50] sustainable it's not going to work you
[00:05:52] might be able to get lucky for this test
[00:05:54] or maybe the next one but your Luck's
[00:05:56] going to run out eventually and that
[00:05:57] entire time you're going to be anxious
[00:05:59] so the key here is to test yourself
[00:06:01] often and here's how you can do it get a
[00:06:03] study buddy and then start making exams
[00:06:06] for each other have a look at the
[00:06:07] marking criteria if you've got some
[00:06:09] really think like an examiner and create
[00:06:11] an exam as close to the real one as you
[00:06:14] can imagine and then as part of your
[00:06:16] regular revision schedule do those exams
[00:06:19] in test conditions it's better to spend
[00:06:21] your time doing that than like rereading
[00:06:23] your nodes for the third time you can
[00:06:25] also supplement this with like other
[00:06:26] practice questions if you've got access
[00:06:28] to those as well and this really
[00:06:29] important don't rely on the answers to
[00:06:33] get through it if you feel like you're
[00:06:35] not really sure about the answer don't
[00:06:37] then look at the answers to figure it
[00:06:38] out and be like oh yeah that makes sense
[00:06:40] that's the answer don't do that make the
[00:06:42] mistake if you're not confident just
[00:06:44] give it your best go generate what you
[00:06:47] can and make the mistakes you're going
[00:06:49] to make anyway have it out in the open
[00:06:51] so that you can see exactly where the
[00:06:53] mistakes are because what makes this
[00:06:55] method really effective is that when you
[00:06:56] make a mistake you now have the
[00:06:57] opportunity to just find and extract
[00:07:00] from it what did you get wrong why did
[00:07:02] you get it wrong and use that as a
[00:07:03] springboard for all the other Associated
[00:07:06] ideas to think okay well I got this
[00:07:08] thing wrong now that I look at this I
[00:07:10] would probably get this this this this
[00:07:12] and that wrong too and now you've got a
[00:07:13] much more focused targeted goal for your
[00:07:17] revision every one mistake gives you
[00:07:20] three four five six different learning
[00:07:22] opportunities do not just make a mistake
[00:07:24] look at it and say oh I could get that
[00:07:26] right like that's a silly mistake if you
[00:07:29] knew it you would have gotten it right
[00:07:32] you can't just get your exam back and be
[00:07:34] like uh excuse me examiner could you
[00:07:36] just mark this one as correct oh I I
[00:07:38] promise I really do know it for me
[00:07:40] during my masters I spent that first
[00:07:42] part intensively studying everything
[00:07:44] that I could and I spent the rest of my
[00:07:46] time intermittently regularly testing
[00:07:49] and challenging myself before I
[00:07:51] submitted any assignment I actually
[00:07:53] talked to each one of the lecturers to
[00:07:55] assess my level of knowledge to look for
[00:07:57] gaps in advance now I I couldn't just
[00:07:59] say like hey here's a draft of my
[00:08:02] assignment can you kind of like tell me
[00:08:04] what I did wrong and like Mark it for me
[00:08:06] so instead I did the bus next thing
[00:08:07] which is I'd have a conversation and i'
[00:08:09] ask very deep and probing questions I
[00:08:12] said hey this is the way that I have
[00:08:14] understood this topic and let me know if
[00:08:17] I've misunderstood something because I
[00:08:19] knew that if there were errors in my
[00:08:20] knowledge it would come through in my
[00:08:22] work anyway and so as a result when it
[00:08:24] came time to getting my grade I expected
[00:08:27] every result I received so those was the
[00:08:29] first major change seeing exam results
[00:08:31] as just the final symptom and
[00:08:33] inevitability and not using the exam
[00:08:36] grade as the main indicator for whether
[00:08:38] I'm learning effectively or not another
[00:08:41] reason that's helpful is actually
[00:08:42] because sometimes your exam is like
[00:08:44] really really soon between now in your
[00:08:46] exam you might not be able to make
[00:08:47] enough changes for that to be reflected
[00:08:49] in your actual final grade but actually
[00:08:52] if you were to continue down that path
[00:08:54] then your next exam you might absolutely
[00:08:56] crush it if you looked at just your exam
[00:08:58] result you might might be making some
[00:08:59] changes see a bad exam result and be
[00:09:02] like a these changes aren't working and
[00:09:03] then abandon that path before you're
[00:09:06] actually reaping the rewards from it I
[00:09:08] see this very very commonly so that was
[00:09:10] the first major change and the second
[00:09:11] one was to kind of like be a bit of a
[00:09:15] prick let me explain I'm not telling you
[00:09:17] to like go slam doors in people's faces
[00:09:20] or like push someone off the stairs what
[00:09:21] I mean is to be really really critical
[00:09:24] and skeptical of everything you learn in
[00:09:27] my first few years of uni and especially
[00:09:28] during High School I thought to be a
[00:09:30] good learner my job was to like consume
[00:09:33] all the information like integrate it
[00:09:35] and then just regurgitate it out like if
[00:09:38] I can remember it I can apply it and I
[00:09:40] can hit the criteria for the exam I'm a
[00:09:42] good learner and so for my first few
[00:09:44] years of uni I spent a lot of time
[00:09:46] optimizing my system to be able to do
[00:09:49] that while also not studying quite as
[00:09:51] much and I was pretty successful I was
[00:09:54] averaging around an A minus through
[00:09:56] medical school which is exactly where I
[00:09:58] wanted to be CU I was also so working
[00:09:59] fulltime I'd already decided that a and
[00:10:01] A+ was just going to take too much
[00:10:03] effort and it wasn't really worth it for
[00:10:04] me having said that thinking back in
[00:10:06] hindsight I definitely could have
[00:10:09] studied more effectively to get an A
[00:10:12] average if I really wanted to actually
[00:10:14] probably would have studied even less
[00:10:16] but I didn't know that at the time okay
[00:10:17] but here's where the problem was fast
[00:10:19] forward like a year and I'm in my first
[00:10:22] hospital placement still as a student
[00:10:24] and I've been getting like an A minus
[00:10:25] average feeling relatively confident I
[00:10:27] go into my first hospital placement
[00:10:28] which is general medicine or Internal
[00:10:30] Medicine went into it feeling pretty
[00:10:32] confident and I failed I straight up
[00:10:35] failed I had over engineered A system
[00:10:38] that was useful for exams but I just
[00:10:42] could not use that knowledge when I was
[00:10:44] applying it to real patients in a real
[00:10:47] Hospital environment and it was a big
[00:10:50] shock for me I had to do a lot of rework
[00:10:53] and reoptimization to get better again
[00:10:56] and I did manage to turn it around I
[00:10:57] eventually ended up getting multiple
[00:10:58] distinctions and the other runs and it
[00:11:00] was a happy ending but it was really
[00:11:02] like unnecessary the reason I'm telling
[00:11:04] you that story is because I realize that
[00:11:08] being a good learner is not just about
[00:11:10] meeting the needs that you have right
[00:11:13] now it's also about figuring out the
[00:11:15] needs that you might have later and
[00:11:17] preparing yourself for now and tomorrow
[00:11:20] because as I always say the future
[00:11:21] version of you is probably going to be
[00:11:23] busier than the version of you now and
[00:11:25] you're going to thank yourself if you
[00:11:27] spent the time to build build a
[00:11:29] foundation that was strong enough that
[00:11:31] you can continually build on it year
[00:11:33] after year which is completely not the
[00:11:36] situation for me when I was going
[00:11:38] through medical school probably 30% of
[00:11:41] all of the time that I spent in medical
[00:11:43] school was just on relearning stuff that
[00:11:46] I didn't learn properly in previous
[00:11:48] years and the thing is and this is
[00:11:50] important it's not like it was one or
[00:11:53] the other I could have learned in such a
[00:11:56] way that I spent the same time and the
[00:11:59] same effort probably actually even less
[00:12:01] time and less effort to get the same
[00:12:03] results but also building a proper
[00:12:05] foundation for my future years but I
[00:12:07] didn't know how and because I didn't I
[00:12:09] wasted a lot more time overall and there
[00:12:12] was a lot more stress involved like when
[00:12:14] I failed that run that was stressful I
[00:12:17] was like damn really I failed a run not
[00:12:20] like didn't do well like literally
[00:12:23] actually straight up failed but it's
[00:12:25] from that experience that I learned what
[00:12:27] it means to build a properly good
[00:12:30] foundation and the reason I said you
[00:12:33] kind of need to be a little bit of a
[00:12:34] prick when you're learning is because it
[00:12:38] is very very difficult to build that
[00:12:41] Foundation to a high quality if you are
[00:12:43] not Ultra critical of what you learn
[00:12:47] when I did my Masters in Education it
[00:12:48] was a lot easier for me to be ultra
[00:12:50] critical because I'd already spent years
[00:12:52] before that like reading through
[00:12:53] research and working with like hundreds
[00:12:55] of Educators around the world so I knew
[00:12:57] that supposed experts also didn't know
[00:13:01] things like they could be wrong too so I
[00:13:03] went into that master's program not with
[00:13:05] a mindset that I was just going to be
[00:13:07] like consume integrate regurgitate I
[00:13:09] wanted to evaluate everything criticize
[00:13:12] it critique it make my own independent
[00:13:15] judgments and conclusions about what was
[00:13:17] being taught and that process allowed me
[00:13:19] to build expertise much much quicker
[00:13:23] than other people in my cohort and for
[00:13:24] those of you that have been following my
[00:13:26] videos for a long time you might
[00:13:27] recognize that those very processes of
[00:13:29] evaluating and criticizing and making
[00:13:31] value judgments those are the processes
[00:13:34] of level five and Bloom's revised tonomy
[00:13:37] which is a a critical threshold in
[00:13:39] Higher roal Learning and I found that a
[00:13:40] lot of people have the mentality that to
[00:13:43] be a good student you have to listen nod
[00:13:47] take it all in and you sort of become a
[00:13:49] good student by making the teacher or
[00:13:52] lecturer like you more I'm not saying
[00:13:54] that you have to be some kind of like
[00:13:55] Angry Ribble to be ultra are critical
[00:13:59] your lecturers probably know way more
[00:14:01] than you do about this subject so here's
[00:14:03] what you do instead this is what I do
[00:14:04] now like all the time take your
[00:14:06] questions and your criticisms be
[00:14:08] critical and have an open discussion
[00:14:11] have conversations with people with the
[00:14:14] mindset that you're missing some
[00:14:15] information you may be wrong about
[00:14:18] things be open to be corrected when you
[00:14:20] are critical and asking questions and
[00:14:23] have doubts but you are open-minded most
[00:14:26] Educators really like that they respect
[00:14:28] that and even if you can't have a
[00:14:29] conversation with your lecturer directly
[00:14:31] it's fine you can do the same thing with
[00:14:33] the same mentality when you're reading a
[00:14:35] textbook be critical look things up fact
[00:14:38] check things but take personal
[00:14:40] responsibility for forming a independent
[00:14:44] critical evaluation of what you are
[00:14:46] learning because if you don't then you
[00:14:49] will never really be able to learn
[00:14:51] anything deeply especially if it's
[00:14:53] complicated or nuan yes you may be able
[00:14:55] to recall some facts and it might be
[00:14:57] okay for your upcoming test or the next
[00:14:59] one but again it's not sustainable at
[00:15:01] the end of the day you're just going to
[00:15:02] end up as one of the other 10 million
[00:15:04] people that did the same degree and know
[00:15:06] the same set of facts by being Ultra
[00:15:09] critical and skeptical and making your
[00:15:11] own independent evaluations it forces
[00:15:14] your brain to work in a higher gear it
[00:15:16] makes the same information stickier more
[00:15:19] memorable and you understand it more
[00:15:20] deeply you can spend the exact same 5
[00:15:23] hours studying something as someone else
[00:15:25] but the person that mentally is taking
[00:15:28] that responsib ility to be critical
[00:15:30] about what they're learning is going to
[00:15:32] remember a lot more and be able to use
[00:15:34] that information more in a much more
[00:15:35] nuanced and complex way and those are
[00:15:38] the type of people that you look at and
[00:15:40] you think how the heck do you know like
[00:15:42] everything you know like we are studying
[00:15:44] the same curriculum we study for the
[00:15:45] same amount of time you end up becoming
[00:15:47] the anomaly because you don't think like
[00:15:49] everyone else does you're thinking like
[00:15:51] how an expert would and so that was
[00:15:52] number two be that annoying person that
[00:15:55] challenges everything but do so with
[00:15:58] humility and open-mindedness even if the
[00:16:01] only thing you're challenging is your
[00:16:02] own thoughts and you're correcting it
[00:16:04] with a Google Search and by the way
[00:16:07] everything that I'm talking about is all
[00:16:09] around the idea of building a
[00:16:10] personalized learning system and it can
[00:16:12] honestly take years like it took years
[00:16:13] for me and a big part of that is just
[00:16:15] figuring out what is working well for
[00:16:17] you and what is not really serving you
[00:16:19] anymore if you're interested in figuring
[00:16:21] out which parts of your Learning System
[00:16:22] you should work on first I've made a
[00:16:24] free quiz that figures out your learning
[00:16:26] strengths and weaknesses and gives you
[00:16:28] some recommendations there's a link to
[00:16:30] that in the description below now
[00:16:31] finally as promised here's my bonus tip
[00:16:33] the first two tips honestly they're
[00:16:35] life-changing in and of themselves like
[00:16:37] they were life-changing for me but this
[00:16:39] final tip just makes everything much
[00:16:41] easier and it is
[00:16:43] to like this
[00:16:45] video wait don't go I'm kidding the
[00:16:48] final tip is to put aside 30 minutes a
[00:16:52] day to just learn and reflect I call it
[00:16:56] Priority time 30 minutes a day is enough
[00:16:59] to change your life and I know this tip
[00:17:01] probably doesn't sound super exciting
[00:17:03] but just hear me out a lot of the time
[00:17:05] we can get so caught up in just meeting
[00:17:08] whatever short-term outcome we've got
[00:17:10] like there's an exam coming up we just
[00:17:11] have to study for it and study for it if
[00:17:12] we take time away from that we're
[00:17:14] sacrificing whatever short-term outcome
[00:17:16] we've got to lose but it's the changes
[00:17:18] and learning that we make that are not
[00:17:20] in the short term that tend to be
[00:17:21] life-changing learning to learn is a
[00:17:23] great example by the time it is so
[00:17:26] urgent and important for you to learn
[00:17:28] and how to learn your exam is probably
[00:17:30] next week and there's not really much
[00:17:32] you can do it's already too late for me
[00:17:35] the worst case scenario is that you
[00:17:37] watch these videos and you think oh
[00:17:38] these are really interesting cool ideas
[00:17:40] yeah yeah I'll give them a go but then
[00:17:42] nothing changes I don't want to be the
[00:17:44] influencer that just makes you like feel
[00:17:46] good when you're watching the video but
[00:17:48] then like there's no impact what matters
[00:17:50] for me is that there is real change and
[00:17:52] action that you take and I know one of
[00:17:55] the things that used to stop me and
[00:17:57] stops a lot of other people people from
[00:17:58] being able to change is not that they're
[00:18:00] not motivated but because we just don't
[00:18:03] prioritize and carve out the time in our
[00:18:06] day to give ourselves the space to think
[00:18:10] and learn and plan and reflect and to
[00:18:13] craft those changes 30 minutes a day I
[00:18:16] know it can be challenging but if you do
[00:18:18] it even just a few times a week I
[00:18:20] promise you after a few weeks life will
[00:18:23] get easier so go out there make a change
[00:18:25] thank you for watching and I'll see you
[00:18:26] next time

=== This is a red flag to an employer ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhULM9qZnic

[00:00:00] is an immediate red flag for any
[00:00:02] applicate is if they really overstate or
[00:00:04] in some cases even mention their High
[00:00:06] School Achievements because the view is
[00:00:08] like this high school is like so
[00:00:11] irrelevant in most cases to an actual
[00:00:13] job if what you're so proud of is that
[00:00:15] you did well in high school it just
[00:00:17] means that you kind of like didn't
[00:00:18] really do much with your life after that


=== Why note-taking software is holding you back ===

[00:00:00] there are many more ways of representing
[00:00:02] information freehand than there is
[00:00:04] usually by software and if it is
[00:00:06] possible with software there's so many
[00:00:07] clicks that it takes to be able to do
[00:00:09] that so for example make some notes that
[00:00:11] we're saying like okay here's a line of
[00:00:13] text here and then this sort of thing is
[00:00:14] related to this one here I could then
[00:00:17] say that let's say that there is another
[00:00:19] thing here and another thing here and
[00:00:21] another thing here and another thing
[00:00:23] here right so if this was an app
[00:00:26] probably the only way that this can be
[00:00:28] done is like this boom boom mhm and then
[00:00:30] maybe like boom boom and then this is
[00:00:32] how it would end up looking yeah but
[00:00:35] this is completely different to for
[00:00:37] example something like this right yeah
[00:00:40] yeah yeah when we think what is the
[00:00:41] characteristic the quality the
[00:00:43] importance the weight the spacing of
[00:00:46] that relationship in relation to
[00:00:48] everything else then it opens up a lot
[00:00:50] of other things


=== You cannot try harder to think deeply. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brrJvm87tns

[00:00:00] the third thing is that you can't try
[00:00:01] harder to think more deeply so a lot of
[00:00:03] you wrote critical thinking as a
[00:00:05] possible barrier you cannot try to think
[00:00:07] more critically just by trying to think
[00:00:09] more critically cuz when you sit there
[00:00:11] with the Page open and you're reading
[00:00:13] the words it doesn't change what you're
[00:00:14] actually doing in your brain just trying
[00:00:16] to be deeper doesn't change anything


=== Handwritten notes VS Typed notes ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzPjDuw1DZw

[00:00:00] research said that handwritten notes are
[00:00:02] better than typed notes because with
[00:00:04] typed notes what was found was that you
[00:00:06] tend to write more when you're typing
[00:00:08] which means that there's less processing
[00:00:10] going on and so we know that longer word
[00:00:13] count is associated with poor
[00:00:14] performance when it comes to note taking
[00:00:17] and I think it's same sort of thing is
[00:00:19] that yes you can create a relationship
[00:00:21] yes you can tag the information and yes
[00:00:22] technically it's organized but it's
[00:00:24] organized in the software doesn't mean
[00:00:26] that it's actually organized in your
[00:00:27] brain because the software did so much
[00:00:29] of the heavy lifting for you


=== How to tell if you've TRULY mastered a new skill ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FZYcf-mAJM

[00:00:00] you have to make sure that you challenge
[00:00:01] yourself properly before assessing that
[00:00:03] you're able to do it correctly and this
[00:00:04] is the idea of enter leaving right
[00:00:06] coding is actually a really good example
[00:00:07] of this it's very easy to learn like a
[00:00:10] lot of theory about lots of different
[00:00:12] functions and then you can follow
[00:00:14] everything step by step okay I've learn
[00:00:16] about this function okay can I write
[00:00:18] that line of code yes okay can I turn
[00:00:20] that into something else yes can I like
[00:00:21] declare a variable yes okay can I use it
[00:00:24] in a function yes and then you can
[00:00:25] continue to do that where you're able to
[00:00:28] do it simply and simply but until you
[00:00:30] step outside and say okay well let's try
[00:00:32] to use all of these together in a
[00:00:35] different context outside of how I
[00:00:37] learned it am I able to manipulate and
[00:00:40] use this information in a different way
[00:00:43] and still retain that level of
[00:00:45] Competency this is the way that it has
[00:00:47] to be trained


=== You cannot force yourself to remember facts ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSEQhbJ_skw

[00:00:00] the second thing is that you cannot will
[00:00:01] yourself just to remember things so you
[00:00:03] can't take information and you can't say
[00:00:05] I'm going to remember this I'm going to
[00:00:07] try my hardest to remember it and you
[00:00:09] can't summon more effort to just try and
[00:00:12] remember something and then remember it
[00:00:14] better your memory does not care about
[00:00:16] how much you want to remember something
[00:00:18] so a lot of people will study and
[00:00:19] because they're struggling with
[00:00:20] remembering things their solution to
[00:00:22] that would be to try harder to remember
[00:00:24] it but that doesn't actually make any
[00:00:26] difference


=== Is medical school fulfilling? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7piTeQGzIJo

[00:00:00] I work with a lot of medical students
[00:00:01] that like don't know who they are
[00:00:02] anymore because they after they enter
[00:00:04] medical school they're just like hating
[00:00:05] life and a lot of these people are doing
[00:00:07] absolutely nothing except for just like
[00:00:09] go to UNI study think about medicine
[00:00:10] think about becoming a doctor hate the
[00:00:12] thought about it and then like go back
[00:00:13] to the cycle of doing that every single
[00:00:14] day and then they're like I hate this
[00:00:16] but that's what I'm doing who am I so my
[00:00:17] solution for those people is just you
[00:00:19] should do stuff like you need to do more
[00:00:20] things in that case right because the
[00:00:22] approach that was working was not doing
[00:00:24] enough


=== DON'T make this mistake when learning new techniques ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z_R7L87Qbg

[00:00:00] one of the things that you have to be
[00:00:01] really really mindful is that when we
[00:00:03] are building the techniques we have to
[00:00:05] build them like we're building the
[00:00:06] foundations of a house like they are
[00:00:08] stacking and building on top of each
[00:00:10] other a lot of the time what will happen
[00:00:13] is that people will start using a
[00:00:15] technique they'll be fine at it this is
[00:00:17] fine they're using it very
[00:00:18] well and then they'll add another
[00:00:20] technique on and they're like okay
[00:00:21] that's fine they're using it well and
[00:00:23] then they'll come to add on a new
[00:00:24] technique and because it's too hard to
[00:00:26] use all three at the same time they stop
[00:00:28] using this one and now they're using
[00:00:30] this one and then they add another one
[00:00:32] on and then you know this this one kind
[00:00:34] of fors through and eventually what
[00:00:36] happens is that you know everything will
[00:00:38] sort of topple and it becomes a mess and
[00:00:41] the system is broken down and then they
[00:00:42] start running into really fundamental
[00:00:44] issues really common example here would
[00:00:46] be like they're really getting into the
[00:00:48] mapping process and nonlinear not taking
[00:00:50] and they're doing that and doing that
[00:00:52] and doing that and they forgotten
[00:00:53] completely about doing space retrieval


=== Study is not the learning. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYzOwY6u8Ss

[00:00:00] so here's what I know now that just
[00:00:01] changed the game studying is not the
[00:00:03] same thing as learning studying is like
[00:00:05] reading a book or writing some notes but
[00:00:06] you haven't learned it until that
[00:00:08] knowledge is in your head and you can
[00:00:10] use it and there's different levels too
[00:00:12] for example regurgitating some facts is
[00:00:13] a lower level than a Nuance discussion
[00:00:16] or solving complex problems researchers
[00:00:19] sometimes talk about this as higher
[00:00:21] order versus lower order learning and
[00:00:24] different types of studying can actually
[00:00:25] help to generate different orders of
[00:00:27] learning why does this matter years ago
[00:00:29] I did know about this stuff and I
[00:00:30] thought I was pretty good at studying
[00:00:32] after all I got into medical school all
[00:00:34] that time and effort that I sunk in it's
[00:00:36] just what you do right you work hard not
[00:00:38] quite imagine you're driving along and
[00:00:39] your car breaks down if you're like me
[00:00:41] pull over pop the hood take a look and
[00:00:43] you think I don't know anything about
[00:00:45] cars if you don't know how the engine
[00:00:47] works you cannot fix it most people know
[00:00:50] that learning is a process but what goes
[00:00:52] on in that process if we don't do well
[00:00:54] do we know why and how to fix it or do
[00:00:56] we just guess and hope causes a lot of
[00:00:58] anxiety


=== Why great medical students does not equate to good doctors ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2dFzlNVfH4

[00:00:00] I went through medical school getting
[00:00:01] like a AE average my first clinical
[00:00:04] attachment general medicine I failed I
[00:00:06] failed because I had been learning for
[00:00:08] the examination I understood each
[00:00:10] Concept in itself in isolation I just
[00:00:12] did not see how to put it together and
[00:00:14] bring it together then I made up for it
[00:00:15] with three back toback distinctions
[00:00:16] after that all right but good idea


=== Software Engineer gets Private Coaching ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTCTIaFjPRc

[00:00:00] you're constantly challenging yourself
[00:00:01] from different angles and different
[00:00:03] context the way that I think about it is
[00:00:05] you're borrowing time from your
[00:00:08] future in order to become a master at
[00:00:11] this you have to be able to mix it and
[00:00:13] match it anyway thank you so much for
[00:00:14] your time and I have learned a lot and I
[00:00:16] have a lot to think about now every
[00:00:18] couple of months I find some members in
[00:00:21] our IC can study program who are active
[00:00:23] and supportive in our community and I
[00:00:25] offer them some 30 minute free coaching
[00:00:27] sessions some of you do seem to really
[00:00:29] like my coaching sty content so I've
[00:00:31] decided to record some of these and post
[00:00:32] them on YouTube before we jump in I'd
[00:00:33] appreciate if you give this video a like
[00:00:35] and if you're interested in joining the
[00:00:36] full program yourself then you can check
[00:00:38] out iin study.com there's a link in the
[00:00:40] description my name is Edgar cabera I'm
[00:00:43] from Mexico studying software engineer
[00:00:46] it's in the University of Las that's
[00:00:49] about it I'm
[00:00:51] in ER I'm in second H second year of the
[00:00:56] career and I'm still I'm about halfway
[00:00:59] through the career
[00:01:00] awesome and what's the main I suppose
[00:01:04] things that you would like me to help
[00:01:06] you with yeah I think one of the things
[00:01:10] that I have seen a lot of focus and it's
[00:01:13] like I think it's very important it's
[00:01:15] about the relationship between practice
[00:01:19] and what you learn in the course so what
[00:01:22] I want to learn is do I need to always
[00:01:26] like during every single lecture or
[00:01:29] every single video do you always have to
[00:01:31] immediately go and practice those stuff
[00:01:34] before advancing into any other stuff of
[00:01:36] the course or can I like I have this in
[00:01:40] mind and then I can continue like a few
[00:01:43] lectures from their course and then
[00:01:45] practice like everything in bulk having
[00:01:48] the consideration that I need to keep
[00:01:50] that relationship like one to five
[00:01:52] between theory and practice so whenever
[00:01:55] you learn any new technique or any new
[00:01:57] skill you just what you're trying to do
[00:01:59] is prevent yourself from having overload
[00:02:02] so there always needs to be this Theory
[00:02:04] practice balance right yeah so you you
[00:02:09] can technically go at any Pace that you
[00:02:11] want M it it just depends on the density
[00:02:14] of the theory and your ability to
[00:02:16] convert that into practice MH and
[00:02:19] usually what I find is that the amount
[00:02:21] that you'd need to know to understand
[00:02:24] how to use any new technique or any new
[00:02:26] learning strategy if we think about the
[00:02:29] total amount that you can know about a
[00:02:31] certain technique um and if you know
[00:02:32] 100% of this technique that means that
[00:02:34] you can do it perfectly accurately then
[00:02:36] the amount that you can know about a
[00:02:37] technique based purely on just a
[00:02:39] theoretical understanding without any
[00:02:41] real experience or practice using it
[00:02:43] there's usually no more than 25% like at
[00:02:46] a maximum this this is why I often say
[00:02:49] there's a 1 to five ratio at least
[00:02:52] because sometimes it's very it's it's
[00:02:53] much lower sometimes it's only 2 or 3%
[00:02:56] this is really obvious when we think
[00:02:57] about other skills like you could
[00:03:00] understand how to do go rock climbing
[00:03:02] yeah but the amount of actual practice
[00:03:05] You' need to not you know fall off and
[00:03:06] die is much much more um and so this is
[00:03:10] the same thing here is that the amount
[00:03:12] of theory depends on the difficulty of
[00:03:14] the technique and then it depends on how
[00:03:17] um how much of it that you've understood
[00:03:19] but the tricky part and this is the
[00:03:21] reason why I usually tell people to be
[00:03:23] very conservative and just like learn
[00:03:24] one thing and practice practice practice
[00:03:26] practice is because this is a relatively
[00:03:28] small percentage so what that means is
[00:03:31] someone that you know has you know
[00:03:33] really really understands the theory of
[00:03:34] very deeply before practice at most
[00:03:37] they're going to understand like 25% of
[00:03:39] it but if you understand less of it
[00:03:41] maybe you understand 10% less and maybe
[00:03:43] that means that you only understand 15%
[00:03:46] now that doesn't seem like a very big
[00:03:47] difference 25% versus 15% but relative
[00:03:50] to how much You' need to know it's a big
[00:03:52] difference right because the amount of
[00:03:54] practice that you need here this is now
[00:03:56] 1 to four in this situation whereas in
[00:03:59] here here it's closer to like one to you
[00:04:02] know like seven to be able to do it
[00:04:04] which means that you need like almost
[00:04:06] double the amount of practice to be able
[00:04:08] to gain the Mastery there so the other
[00:04:11] issue is that when you have skills and
[00:04:13] techniques applied in the real world and
[00:04:15] the real world settings with like
[00:04:16] multiple curriculums and pressures and
[00:04:18] you know assessments and things like
[00:04:19] that there are other variables that are
[00:04:21] then added on so let's say now we've got
[00:04:23] two different techniques that are added
[00:04:25] on at the same time well now we have to
[00:04:27] try to practice two separate techniques
[00:04:29] and understand the cause and effect
[00:04:31] relationship between the technique and
[00:04:33] the impact that it's having and then
[00:04:35] even at just two techniques that can
[00:04:36] become you know quite challenging so one
[00:04:39] of the things that I would normally as a
[00:04:41] rule recommend is first of all to just
[00:04:44] play it safe yeah because there's really
[00:04:47] nothing worse than wasting time on going
[00:04:49] too fast yeah yeah which is
[00:04:51] counterintuitive but the second thing is
[00:04:54] that you can try to do more and try to
[00:04:57] move a little bit faster but when you're
[00:05:00] doing the technique be really really
[00:05:02] attentive to two things the first is how
[00:05:05] much concentration and mental effort
[00:05:07] does it take for me to just be able to
[00:05:10] do the technique not even thinking about
[00:05:12] doing it correctly just doing it and
[00:05:14] then the second thing is how effective
[00:05:17] am I finding the technique and is that
[00:05:19] aligned with how effective I'm told it's
[00:05:21] meant to be when I teach people
[00:05:23] techniques I'm I'm pretty clear about
[00:05:24] how effective it's meant to be some of
[00:05:26] them are going to be like amazing some
[00:05:27] of them it's like it improves a little
[00:05:29] bit so if I've said something improves a
[00:05:31] little bit and you try it and it's easy
[00:05:34] to use and it's improved it a little bit
[00:05:36] and the amount of effort you need to
[00:05:37] spend to do the technique is is very low
[00:05:41] that's something that we call Germain
[00:05:43] load was a complicated topic but if that
[00:05:46] happens then you can move on to add the
[00:05:48] new the next technique and if you add
[00:05:49] the next technique and you now think
[00:05:51] okay it's still pretty easy then you can
[00:05:53] move on to the next one it gets harder
[00:05:55] though because as you add more and more
[00:05:57] techniques the whole system also needs
[00:06:00] to function so you might be able to do
[00:06:01] each individual technique very well but
[00:06:03] when you try to do all three
[00:06:04] simultaneously it might get much much
[00:06:06] harder so what that would mean is you
[00:06:08] need to just slow down there but if you
[00:06:09] use a technique and you think okay I'm
[00:06:11] getting the result that I'm told I
[00:06:14] should get but the amount of effort and
[00:06:16] concentration I need to be able to pull
[00:06:18] it off is very high then you should not
[00:06:22] because as soon as you add another
[00:06:23] technique on it's going to be harder or
[00:06:25] you think it's very easy to do it but
[00:06:28] I'm not getting the result that I'm that
[00:06:30] I'm meant to be getting that's even
[00:06:31] worse because it means you're not even
[00:06:33] doing it right so the effort is not
[00:06:35] there because we're not doing the right
[00:06:37] thing it's kind of like saying hey I
[00:06:38] think going to the gym and working out
[00:06:40] is really easy I don't spend any effort
[00:06:43] at all lifting weights and then you see
[00:06:45] what they're doing and all they're doing
[00:06:46] is going inside and looking at
[00:06:47] themselves in the mirror so it's like
[00:06:49] they're not even doing the right process
[00:06:51] yeah so that's usually what I look for
[00:06:54] if I see that someone is using a new
[00:06:56] technique they're finding that it's
[00:06:58] relatively easy and getting the effect
[00:07:00] that they're meant to be getting then
[00:07:01] they should be ready to move on and then
[00:07:03] when they add a new technique on then we
[00:07:05] look again the whole system isn't
[00:07:06] working one of the things also that you
[00:07:09] have to be really really mindful is that
[00:07:11] when we are building the techniques we
[00:07:13] have to build them like we're building
[00:07:14] the foundations of a house like they are
[00:07:17] stacking and building on top of each
[00:07:19] other a lot of the time what will happen
[00:07:21] is that people will start using a
[00:07:23] technique they'll be fine at it this is
[00:07:25] fine they're work they're using it very
[00:07:27] well mhm and then they'll add another
[00:07:29] technique on and they're like okay
[00:07:30] that's fine they're using it well and
[00:07:32] then they'll come to add on a new
[00:07:33] technique and because it's too hard to
[00:07:35] use all three at the same time they
[00:07:37] stopped using this one and now they're
[00:07:39] using this one and then they add another
[00:07:41] one on and then you know this this one
[00:07:43] kind of forc through and eventually what
[00:07:45] happens is that you know everything will
[00:07:47] sort of topple and it becomes a mess and
[00:07:50] the system is broken down and then they
[00:07:51] start running into really fundamental
[00:07:53] issues really common example here would
[00:07:55] be like the really getting into the
[00:07:57] mapping process and nonlinear not taking
[00:07:59] and they're doing that and doing that
[00:08:00] and doing that and they forgotten
[00:08:02] completely about doing space retrieval
[00:08:05] yeah right so so it's it's kind of like
[00:08:08] a long answer to to your question but
[00:08:09] did that answer it no no yeah yeah
[00:08:12] totally because I have like that um
[00:08:17] because when I started like H seeing
[00:08:21] stuff through the course and through
[00:08:23] your YouTube channel and H because I
[00:08:26] already have like some notion on how
[00:08:29] Lear happens and how to learn new skills
[00:08:31] and stuff because I I really like I
[00:08:33] really enjoy the process of acquiring
[00:08:35] new stuff to do like being able to be
[00:08:39] the better version of myself so I have
[00:08:42] always failed in that process in the
[00:08:44] process of practicing enough because I
[00:08:47] get so passionate about the topic that I
[00:08:50] just need to learn more and learn more
[00:08:52] and learn more and if you do it just for
[00:08:55] the because you just like the topic and
[00:08:57] you are just interested about it I think
[00:09:00] that that's okay but if you want to
[00:09:02] apply it you really need to practice it
[00:09:04] before going to the next thing because
[00:09:07] it has happened to me for example with
[00:09:09] coding because when I started before I
[00:09:11] started ER going to University like in
[00:09:14] high school and stuff I saw a lot of
[00:09:17] YouTube videos about coding and then
[00:09:19] when I tried to do it I realized that I
[00:09:21] couldn't retrieve anything about what I
[00:09:23] have supposedly learned so it's just a
[00:09:27] something that I knew had a problem with
[00:09:31] with retrieving stuff to actually apply
[00:09:33] it um but I didn't exactly know how to
[00:09:36] do it like how to patch that hole Yeah
[00:09:40] another thing that I'll add on to that I
[00:09:41] just thought of when you were explaining
[00:09:43] is that you you have to make sure that
[00:09:45] you challenge yourself properly before
[00:09:47] assessing that you're able to do it
[00:09:48] correctly and this is the idea of
[00:09:49] interleaving right is that it's not
[00:09:52] enough just to say okay I can do it well
[00:09:54] in the simple direct method of practice
[00:09:57] or execution that I've learned coding is
[00:09:58] actually really good example of this is
[00:10:00] that it's really really possible and
[00:10:02] actually frankly very easy because
[00:10:03] there's so many courses and things out
[00:10:05] there that just teach you about coding
[00:10:06] it's very easy to learn like a lot of
[00:10:09] theory about lots of different functions
[00:10:11] and then you can follow everything step
[00:10:13] by step okay I've learned about this
[00:10:15] function okay can I write that line of
[00:10:16] code yes okay can I turn that into
[00:10:18] something else yes all right like let's
[00:10:20] move on to the next one let's introduce
[00:10:21] some more variables can I like declare a
[00:10:23] variable yes okay can I call the
[00:10:25] variable yes can I use it in a function
[00:10:27] yes and then you can continue to do that
[00:10:30] you're able to do it simply and simply
[00:10:31] but until you actually step outside and
[00:10:33] say okay well let's try to use all of
[00:10:35] these together in a different context
[00:10:39] outside of how I learned it am I able to
[00:10:42] manipulate and use this information in a
[00:10:45] different way and still retain that
[00:10:47] level of Competency and this is the this
[00:10:49] is the way that it has to be trained you
[00:10:51] take a piece of theory you practice it
[00:10:53] you can do it simply sometimes you can
[00:10:55] do it in this in one go sometimes it
[00:10:57] takes a little bit more after after you
[00:10:59] do that you can add on the next thing
[00:11:00] you add on the next thing and then you
[00:11:01] try to use it and then you try to mix it
[00:11:04] and then you try and can you still do it
[00:11:06] okay now you add on the next one so
[00:11:08] you're constantly mixing and
[00:11:11] interleaving and challenging yourself
[00:11:13] from different angles and different
[00:11:14] context with each new thing that you add
[00:11:17] on and the way that I think about it is
[00:11:19] you're borrowing time from your future
[00:11:22] to do
[00:11:23] this like in order to become a master at
[00:11:26] this you have to do all of this anyway
[00:11:29] you have to be able to mix it and match
[00:11:30] it anyway usually what people will do is
[00:11:32] they'll try to get a Mastery of the
[00:11:34] things step by step first and then
[00:11:36] they'll try to mix it together to get
[00:11:37] the Mastery but by doing that they're
[00:11:39] suffering because they're now operating
[00:11:41] at a lower efficiency right now so
[00:11:44] they're they're going to struggle with
[00:11:45] actually being able to learn it properly
[00:11:47] right now because of the fact that their
[00:11:48] memory is not going to be as strong and
[00:11:50] they're going to forget things and now
[00:11:51] they have to spend more time learning it
[00:11:53] and relearning I call this learning debt
[00:11:55] right and so instead if we just use the
[00:11:58] time we were going to to spend anyway
[00:12:00] and we do it now then we can gain that
[00:12:02] Mastery so that by the time we are at
[00:12:04] the bottom and we're actually properly
[00:12:05] done we also have a very very high level
[00:12:08] of Mastery it also is much less
[00:12:10] stressful in curriculums or in an exam
[00:12:13] because when you get to the time of an
[00:12:14] exam you know you're basically ready to
[00:12:16] sit the exam straight away there's
[00:12:18] nothing more that has to happen but you
[00:12:20] know people generally tend to want to go
[00:12:22] fast and just cover as much stuff as
[00:12:23] possible and so yeah yeah I'm actually
[00:12:26] like really guilty about that because
[00:12:29] see out of these YouTube videos that
[00:12:30] that is like learn JavaScript or learn
[00:12:33] go or learn X language in five hours so
[00:12:36] in your head you think I just need to
[00:12:38] get through this course and then I'm
[00:12:40] Gonna Know It And then I try to do
[00:12:43] something with the language and can't
[00:12:44] remember anything yeah when you have
[00:12:47] finished like a semester of University
[00:12:50] and then the the the finals are coming
[00:12:52] up and then you realize that because of
[00:12:56] trying to like free up time free of time
[00:12:59] by going as fast as possible you just
[00:13:03] have like yeah like you said you have
[00:13:06] just stolen yourself from being able to
[00:13:09] actually learn properly from the
[00:13:11] beginning and it's less stressful if you
[00:13:13] can do like this Tiny Steps From the
[00:13:15] Beginning than trying to recompile
[00:13:17] everything at once the other stuff that
[00:13:20] I wanted to um ask about is I usually
[00:13:24] use obsidian obsidian is like the place
[00:13:27] where I have my most notes I first tried
[00:13:30] to do settle casting I couldn't retrieve
[00:13:32] anything I because I had so many notes
[00:13:35] and because settle casting like didn't
[00:13:38] work for me in the fact that my brain
[00:13:41] couldn't like remember what exact
[00:13:45] combination of words I use to retrieve a
[00:13:47] note or something there is a plugin in
[00:13:49] obsidian where you can do mind PS so
[00:13:53] it's like this kind of nonlinear note
[00:13:55] taking I think that the question is do
[00:13:58] you think there is like a connection
[00:14:01] between like the physical way of not
[00:14:03] taking being like better or being like
[00:14:07] Superior in any way than having this
[00:14:09] like Digital Way of nonlinear note
[00:14:12] taking that's a good question and
[00:14:14] something that I've experimented with a
[00:14:15] lot and I've read the research on and
[00:14:19] the in the research space there isn't a
[00:14:21] definitive answer um if there is more of
[00:14:25] a conclusion it does lean more towards
[00:14:28] doing it physically yeah but the reason
[00:14:31] that physical tends to be better is not
[00:14:34] necessarily because there's anything
[00:14:35] wrong with digital it's probably because
[00:14:38] the tools that are designed are not
[00:14:40] cognitively optimizing enough so there
[00:14:42] are some advantages with being able to
[00:14:44] do things
[00:14:46] physically and and I you know like the
[00:14:48] way that I do it is like essentially a
[00:14:50] hybrid right you know using a a tablet
[00:14:52] and so it's it's digital but it's
[00:14:54] freehand and the reason that I still
[00:14:58] despite having spent so many
[00:15:00] hours trying a different like room or
[00:15:04] obsidian or like you know Lucid chart or
[00:15:07] many other different types of um
[00:15:09] nonlinear kind of mapping softwares and
[00:15:11] I get emails literally every day from
[00:15:14] mindmapping software people that want to
[00:15:16] sponsor me in a video and I say no to
[00:15:18] all of them because of the fact that I
[00:15:20] don't think there's actually a software
[00:15:21] that really does this well at the moment
[00:15:23] here are some of the advantages that you
[00:15:24] get with freehand that you I just don't
[00:15:26] see happening with the digital the first
[00:15:29] thing with digital it's too easy to just
[00:15:33] create relationships and just space and
[00:15:35] just like put things down and the fact
[00:15:38] that there's no
[00:15:39] barrier means that the information is
[00:15:42] prioritized and processed less and I
[00:15:44] think this is the same thing as to why
[00:15:45] we saw that research said that
[00:15:47] handwritten notes are better than typed
[00:15:49] notes because with typed notes what what
[00:15:52] was found was that you tend to write
[00:15:54] more when you're typing which means that
[00:15:56] there's less processing going on and so
[00:15:58] we know that longer word count is
[00:16:01] associated with poor performance when it
[00:16:02] comes to note taking and I think it's
[00:16:05] same sort of thing is that yes you can
[00:16:07] create a relationship yes you can tag
[00:16:09] the information and yes technically it's
[00:16:10] organized but it's organized in the
[00:16:12] software doesn't mean that it's actually
[00:16:13] organized in your brain because the
[00:16:15] software do so much of the heavy lifting
[00:16:17] for you so that's the first thing is
[00:16:19] that it's just too easy and it doesn't
[00:16:20] Force the prioritization the second
[00:16:22] thing is that a big big part in fact
[00:16:24] probably 80 to 90% of the learning
[00:16:27] process when you're learning new
[00:16:28] information is just hypothesizing
[00:16:31] structures rewriting them and like
[00:16:33] redoing it and trying to make that make
[00:16:36] that fit yeah it's not as easy to do
[00:16:39] that when you're committing it to a
[00:16:41] software because often when you're
[00:16:42] creating the note actually creates the
[00:16:44] record of it and so it's hard to
[00:16:46] actually then just delete it and when
[00:16:49] you create it there's like a certain
[00:16:50] minimum amount you have to invest to
[00:16:51] creating that so it's harder to create
[00:16:53] sort of the scratch Pad experience where
[00:16:56] you're just like committing revising
[00:16:58] dele leading moving uh and that sort of
[00:17:00] thing the third thing is that there are
[00:17:02] many more ways of representing
[00:17:04] information uh freehand then there is
[00:17:07] usually buy software and if it is
[00:17:09] possible a software there's so many
[00:17:10] clicks that it takes to be able to do
[00:17:12] that so for example like if I wanted to
[00:17:15] if I wanted to like make some notes that
[00:17:18] we're saying like okay here's a line of
[00:17:20] text here and then this sort of thing is
[00:17:22] related to this one here okay I could
[00:17:25] say I could then say that let's say that
[00:17:27] there is another thing here and another
[00:17:29] thing here and another thing here and
[00:17:32] another thing here right so if this was
[00:17:34] an app probably the only way that this
[00:17:36] can be done is like this boom boom and
[00:17:39] then maybe like boom boom boom okay
[00:17:42] maybe maybe like this and then this is
[00:17:44] how it would end up looking yeah but
[00:17:47] this is completely different to for
[00:17:49] example something like this right yeah
[00:17:51] yeah yeah so like this is just a single
[00:17:54] example and there's so many other
[00:17:55] combinations that we can we can create
[00:17:57] from this that
[00:17:59] that if we just create it as a binary is
[00:18:01] there a relationship or not or not then
[00:18:04] it it's just everything just becomes a
[00:18:06] line but when we think what is the
[00:18:07] characteristic the quality the
[00:18:09] importance the um the weight the the
[00:18:13] spacing of that relationship in relation
[00:18:15] to everything else then it opens up a
[00:18:17] lot of other things um and then the
[00:18:19] final benefit is that it's much easier
[00:18:20] to do visual anchoring which is to
[00:18:24] visually make a certain concept appear
[00:18:26] more important and and have maybe
[00:18:29] imagery involved in it to actually
[00:18:31] create like a little memory Landmark
[00:18:34] that our brain is going to find easier
[00:18:36] to to hold on to so for example I could
[00:18:38] have like a right so now that becomes a
[00:18:41] visual you know landmark and if this was
[00:18:43] I don't know what this concept is but if
[00:18:45] it's related to some plant and Mountain
[00:18:47] you know like that would be then yeah so
[00:18:50] for me I think freehand is still the way
[00:18:52] to go I don't I maybe one day software
[00:18:56] will catch up to be able to do do this
[00:18:58] we're actually thinking about creating a
[00:18:59] software ourselves because um there's
[00:19:02] lots of room for improvement um but at
[00:19:06] the moment I don't think it does a good
[00:19:07] job I think obsidian is a really good
[00:19:09] app for second brain management yeah but
[00:19:11] second brain management is is used as a
[00:19:13] reference tool it's a reference software
[00:19:16] it's not for primary
[00:19:19] encoding and so it's a completely
[00:19:21] different way but you could have
[00:19:22] multiple you could have maps that are
[00:19:24] stored within obsidian and then Maps
[00:19:27] could be Rel ated to other Maps as a
[00:19:29] conceptual Network that would work
[00:19:32] fine but the primary encoding I don't
[00:19:35] think I would I I personally would not
[00:19:37] put it on obsidian and and I don't yeah
[00:19:41] yeah no I have like before everything
[00:19:45] doing or like taking seriously like
[00:19:47] trying to learn as best as I can I I do
[00:19:50] try to like I have been using this Oben
[00:19:53] as a prar in coding but I don't think I
[00:19:56] use it in a way that most people use it
[00:19:59] because like uh after watching a lot of
[00:20:02] videos a lot of your videos actually and
[00:20:05] seeing the course I think that the best
[00:20:07] way like simplify a ton of information
[00:20:11] like the ton of research that is into
[00:20:12] learning I think that you just need to
[00:20:15] be try to maximize your cognitive
[00:20:18] resources to it with a less amount of of
[00:20:21] effort so that you can encode everything
[00:20:24] properly that you don't need to revise
[00:20:26] things more often and that you don't get
[00:20:28] exhausted about doing the process people
[00:20:31] think about doing mind maps on obsidian
[00:20:33] think people think about putting their
[00:20:35] mind maps on obsidian but you can also
[00:20:37] think about putting obsidian in your map
[00:20:40] so for example you can have like a node
[00:20:42] coming out across here and you can just
[00:20:44] literally say like hash like yeah you
[00:20:46] know like whatever the tag is and then
[00:20:49] all the detailed information like all
[00:20:50] the code stimets that might be related
[00:20:52] to that particular function that's
[00:20:53] related there and so you've got this as
[00:20:55] a reference and then you've got obsidian
[00:20:57] just purely as a second brain yeah so if
[00:21:00] we understand clearly what apps not just
[00:21:02] obsidian but like apps like obsidian are
[00:21:04] really useful for but then where its
[00:21:07] limitations are then we can use it to
[00:21:08] its full effect but it's just like any
[00:21:10] tool really when you try to make it do
[00:21:12] something that it's not the best for you
[00:21:14] will suffer for it thank you so much for
[00:21:17] your time and you have helpful thank you
[00:21:20] for coming on and asking your questions
[00:21:21] I hope hope that helped yeah a lot
[00:21:24] actually I have learned a lot and I have
[00:21:26] a lot to think about now
[00:21:28] [Music]


=== Are you trying too many learning techniques at once? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXl7WwIkMBw

[00:00:00] as you add more and more techniques the
[00:00:02] whole system also needs to function if
[00:00:04] you use a technique and you think okay
[00:00:06] I'm getting the result that I'm told I
[00:00:09] should get but the amount of effort and
[00:00:11] concentration I need to be able to pull
[00:00:13] it off is very high then you should not
[00:00:16] because as soon as you add another
[00:00:17] technique on it's going to be harder or
[00:00:20] you think it's very easy to do it but
[00:00:22] I'm not getting the result that I meant
[00:00:24] to be getting that's even worse because
[00:00:26] it means you're not even doing it right
[00:00:28] so the effort is not there because we're
[00:00:30] not doing the right thing that's usually
[00:00:31] what I look for if I see that someone is
[00:00:33] using a new technique they're finding
[00:00:35] that it's relatively easy and they're
[00:00:37] getting the effect that they're meant to
[00:00:39] be getting then they should be ready to
[00:00:40] move on and then when they add a new
[00:00:42] technique on then we look again the
[00:00:44] whole system isn't working


=== Do this to prevent OVERLOAD when learning a new skill ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62YYItQPk1o

[00:00:00] whenever you learn any new technique or
[00:00:02] any new skill what you're trying to do
[00:00:03] is prevent yourself from having overload
[00:00:06] so there always needs to be this Theory
[00:00:08] practice balance right yeah you can
[00:00:11] technically go at any Pace that you want
[00:00:14] it just depends on the density of the
[00:00:16] theory and your ability to convert that
[00:00:18] into practice if we think about the
[00:00:20] total amount that you can know about a
[00:00:22] certain technique um and if you know
[00:00:23] 100% of this technique that means that
[00:00:25] you can do it perfectly accurately then
[00:00:27] the amount that you can know about a
[00:00:28] technique based purely on just a
[00:00:30] theoretical understanding without any
[00:00:32] real experience or practice using it is
[00:00:35] usually no more than 25% like at a
[00:00:37] maximum this this is why I often say
[00:00:40] there's a 1 to five ratio at least
[00:00:42] sometimes it's only 2 or 3% the amount
[00:00:45] of theory depends on the difficulty of
[00:00:47] the technique and then it depends on how
[00:00:49] much of it that you've understood


=== How medical students are wasting time in hospital ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHM0a0Y7Gy4

[00:00:00] so if you spend 6 hours at a hospital
[00:00:02] you're not really getting like 6 hours
[00:00:04] of learning from that like the primary
[00:00:06] example I can think of is if you're in
[00:00:07] like a long operation and you're just
[00:00:09] watching and you're just I don't know
[00:00:10] you're holding a body cavity open for
[00:00:11] like 4 hours it's entirely possible to
[00:00:13] leave that experience Having learned
[00:00:15] absolutely nothing not only Having
[00:00:17] learned nothing all you have learned is
[00:00:18] that you never want to do surgery


=== This is why your brain does not remember things. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azcRaY4H5ew

[00:00:00] you know that feeling you get when
[00:00:00] you're reading something and you think I
[00:00:02] am not going to remember this you know
[00:00:03] you're going to have to go over it again
[00:00:05] and again and again you can feel the
[00:00:06] information slipping out of your brain
[00:00:08] who's felt that before your brain is
[00:00:10] telling you this is irrelevant it's
[00:00:12] isolated so instead of just saying oh
[00:00:14] well smashing into our notes to deal
[00:00:15] with later and staying in that lower
[00:00:17] order flick up into the higher order and
[00:00:19] make it relevant so try this start a
[00:00:22] tally when you study and count how often
[00:00:24] you get this feeling some of you will
[00:00:25] realize this is the only feeling you
[00:00:27] have when you study the goal is to
[00:00:28] reduce this number by about 10% every
[00:00:31] time you study how step two group
[00:00:33] information together


=== The insane content load from medical school ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt45yithT6M

[00:00:00] in the first 2 weeks of biomed first
[00:00:02] year university for just one of the four
[00:00:04] papers it was roughly the entirety of
[00:00:06] year 13 biology so it's a crazy pce and
[00:00:08] crazy volume but as a result I
[00:00:10] compensated by being equally crazy so I
[00:00:12] studied 15 to 20 hours a day 7 days a
[00:00:14] week for nine consecutive months I was
[00:00:16] extremely sleep deprived I was literally
[00:00:18] hallucinating we can talk about that
[00:00:20] another time but very distressful
[00:00:21] physically emotionally mentally like all
[00:00:24] of it just not good I talk about it with
[00:00:26] a smile now but no it was really not not
[00:00:27] a good time I did do well though and I
[00:00:29] was accept Ed into Medical School
[00:00:31] eventually great so I won but I didn't
[00:00:33] because when I entered into medical
[00:00:34] school I realized that the content is
[00:00:36] around 2 to three times premid and then
[00:00:38] I wasn't majoring in math but I thought
[00:00:40] I can't study 15 to 40 hours a day


=== Applying information is learning ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDhXwDdqFHU

[00:00:00] how many of you heard the saying
[00:00:01] memorizing is not real learning
[00:00:02] understanding is real learning have any
[00:00:04] of you heard that saying before yeah
[00:00:05] it's just not true just because you
[00:00:07] understand something doesn't mean you've
[00:00:08] actually learned it in order for you to
[00:00:09] learn it it needs to stay in your in
[00:00:12] your memory and then you need to be able
[00:00:13] to use the memory that's like the
[00:00:14] functional part of learning


=== How to be prepared for curveball exam questions ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niohwMlK6XI

[00:00:00] so back in the early days of uni I used
[00:00:01] to have these really really long
[00:00:03] studying blocks where I'd sit down for
[00:00:04] like 6 or 7 hours and I produced this
[00:00:07] beautiful summary page of everything I
[00:00:09] learned in the last week or two and
[00:00:10] sometimes I'd even print them out and
[00:00:11] make my own little study textbook
[00:00:13] booklet thing and then a couple weeks
[00:00:15] later I'd look at this booklet and I
[00:00:17] just wonder where all that knowledge
[00:00:18] went I knew that even though I was on
[00:00:20] top of all my flash cards I had good
[00:00:22] fact recall I felt confident I would go
[00:00:24] into an exam and there still be those
[00:00:26] curveball questions that are going to
[00:00:28] throw me off that I'm going to get wrong
[00:00:30] and this is what interleaving can help
[00:00:33] you with interleaving is an incredibly
[00:00:35] effective studying strategy where
[00:00:37] instead of studying just one thing in
[00:00:39] one way and testing yourself in the same
[00:00:42] way every single time you are
[00:00:43] deliberately going to test yourself in
[00:00:46] different ways so yes do a practice
[00:00:48] question yes quiz each other yes do a
[00:00:51] summary page but also do those things
[00:00:53] with Concept combinations that you
[00:00:55] haven't thought of before


=== Why you NEED to be studying in layers ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94HIe9rsMTw

[00:00:00] one of the things that I hate about
[00:00:01] taking a bath is that it takes a really
[00:00:02] long time for the bathtub to fill out I
[00:00:04] have to leave that tap on for like at
[00:00:06] least 10 minutes before it looks like I
[00:00:08] could potentially step into that and
[00:00:10] studying should actually be like filling
[00:00:12] a bathtub your brain actually likes
[00:00:14] learning broadly in layers more than it
[00:00:17] likes learning really deeply one at a
[00:00:20] time so instead of studying one
[00:00:22] paragraph and then the next paragraph
[00:00:23] and the next paragraph the next
[00:00:24] paragraph then finishing a chapter that
[00:00:26] way it's better to skim the chapter and
[00:00:29] then go over the same chapter again now
[00:00:31] in a little bit more detail so you want
[00:00:32] to cover all of the most basic
[00:00:35] superficial Concepts first and then you
[00:00:36] want to layer that on top with some more
[00:00:38] detailed Concepts and then you will
[00:00:39] layer that on top with even more detail
[00:00:42] and you will find that number one it's a
[00:00:43] much more effective way of learning it's
[00:00:46] easier to understand Concepts your
[00:00:47] memory is going to be way better but
[00:00:49] also it's going to feel slower even
[00:00:52] though it's not because you don't see
[00:00:54] the level rising as quickly


=== After 10,000 Hours of Studying, I Discovered The Best Learning Technique ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeKMjwiF3Pc

[00:00:00] I went to medical school when I was 18
[00:00:01] and since then I have studied easily
[00:00:03] over 10,000 hours yes that is a lot of
[00:00:06] studying and the majority of that time
[00:00:08] was spent on revision and review I used
[00:00:10] everything from space repetition and
[00:00:12] active recall with flash cards to
[00:00:13] practice questions summary Pages brain
[00:00:16] dumps but I finally discovered one of
[00:00:17] the most powerful techniques of all and
[00:00:20] it's called interleaving in this video
[00:00:23] I'm going to tell you exactly how you
[00:00:24] can use interleaving to upgrade your
[00:00:26] revision and become a more efficient
[00:00:28] learner by the way when I say the word
[00:00:30] revision I'm talking about going over
[00:00:32] material and reviewing stuff that you've
[00:00:33] already studied before I know some other
[00:00:35] countries use different words I'll start
[00:00:36] off by telling you what interleaving is
[00:00:38] and how to do it and at the end of the
[00:00:40] video I'll give you my four rules that
[00:00:42] you can follow to make sure you're doing
[00:00:43] into leaving the right way if you're new
[00:00:45] to the channel welcome I'm Dr Justin s
[00:00:48] I'm a full-time learning coach and the
[00:00:49] head of learning at iin study I'm also a
[00:00:50] former medical doctor and I've worked
[00:00:52] with tens of thousands of students from
[00:00:54] around the world to help them learn more
[00:00:56] efficiently now imagine if there was a
[00:00:58] single technique that was so effective
[00:00:59] Ive that it could help you improve your
[00:01:01] memory improve your test performance
[00:01:03] even help you to learn new Concepts that
[00:01:05] you have never encountered before well
[00:01:07] that is what interleaving is so let me
[00:01:10] explain how it works back in high school
[00:01:12] I used to be really involved in
[00:01:13] techwondo it was actually like the first
[00:01:15] sport that I was ever really good at
[00:01:17] very stereotypical Korean I know but we
[00:01:19] used to do these drills where we kick
[00:01:21] the paddle you know someone's holding a
[00:01:22] pad and you aim for it and then you kick
[00:01:24] it and instead of just practicing
[00:01:27] kicking the same paddle how at the same
[00:01:29] distance the same every single time what
[00:01:31] we' do is sometimes we' Bring It Forward
[00:01:32] sometimes we' bring it closer and so we
[00:01:34] would have to adjust on the Fly where to
[00:01:37] aim our kick and by doing this it would
[00:01:39] train my ability to use that kick in any
[00:01:43] situation the reason I'm telling you
[00:01:44] this is because that is actually a form
[00:01:47] of interleaving and the concept is very
[00:01:49] similar for studying interleaving is
[00:01:51] when you learn something by mixing
[00:01:53] different concepts and different facts
[00:01:56] different angles and variations while
[00:01:58] you learn something instead of of doing
[00:02:00] what's called blocked practice which is
[00:02:02] where you would just start with one
[00:02:04] concept and you learn it fully before
[00:02:05] moving on to the next one blocked
[00:02:07] practice for practicing a kick would be
[00:02:10] holding it in the exact same place every
[00:02:12] single time until I've mastered it and
[00:02:13] then moving it higher moving it lower
[00:02:15] forward back for something like
[00:02:16] basketball it would be standing on the
[00:02:18] free throw line practicing shooting it
[00:02:20] from that exact same spot every single
[00:02:22] time until you've mastered it but with
[00:02:25] interleaving that's when we are changing
[00:02:27] things up we're moving it Forward we're
[00:02:29] moving it back we're standing in front
[00:02:31] of the line we're standing a little bit
[00:02:32] behind the line left of the line right
[00:02:34] of the line and we're giving ourselves
[00:02:36] variations of the same concept and so
[00:02:39] for studying it's about looking at a
[00:02:41] concept from multiple different
[00:02:43] perspectives to help understand it
[00:02:45] rather than trying to understand it
[00:02:47] through just one perspective first for
[00:02:50] example let's say that I'm learning
[00:02:52] about the effect of British colonialism
[00:02:54] on India the blocked method of learning
[00:02:56] which by the way is the most common way
[00:02:58] that people use would be to learn about
[00:03:01] each Effect one by one an inter leave
[00:03:04] method would be to take all of the
[00:03:06] different effects try and generally
[00:03:08] understand one of them then move on to
[00:03:11] another effect and compare and contrast
[00:03:13] them to find similarities and
[00:03:14] differences and then we do the same
[00:03:15] thing for another effect and we look for
[00:03:17] similarities and differences and then
[00:03:19] after we've done three different effects
[00:03:22] we might move back to the first one and
[00:03:24] learn that one a little bit more deeply
[00:03:26] and then again compare and contrast that
[00:03:27] with the second one and the third one
[00:03:29] and that cycle continues until we have
[00:03:31] learned everything if I'm learning
[00:03:32] something more technical like the
[00:03:34] physiology of how a muscle contracts a
[00:03:36] blocked method would be to learn the
[00:03:38] physiology and just learn that process
[00:03:41] until I feel like I've completely
[00:03:42] understood it and then maybe a week
[00:03:44] later during a revision session I'm
[00:03:45] going to test myself with some practice
[00:03:47] questions and flash cards in that method
[00:03:49] we're looking at one concept from one
[00:03:51] perspective until we feel like we're
[00:03:52] fully mastered it using inter leaving
[00:03:54] would mean that I learn how the muscle
[00:03:56] contracts in a normal situation and then
[00:03:58] I compare that with how it is in a
[00:04:00] disease situation and then maybe how I
[00:04:02] would treat that diseased muscle later
[00:04:04] when I go to test myself and review it
[00:04:07] I'm going to be focusing on comparing
[00:04:08] and contrasting the differences between
[00:04:10] those situations see now it's the same
[00:04:13] process but we're looking at that
[00:04:15] process from multiple angles the process
[00:04:16] of normal versus disease versus treating
[00:04:19] that disease and trying to get it back
[00:04:21] to normal and that comparing and
[00:04:23] contrasting is where the value seems to
[00:04:26] be into leaving as helpful because by
[00:04:28] giving yourself very variations of a
[00:04:30] concept it helps your brain form a
[00:04:32] better picture of what the concept is
[00:04:34] versus what it is not it pushes your
[00:04:36] brain to pay attention to the parts of
[00:04:39] the information that make it
[00:04:41] characteristic and sticky I sort of
[00:04:43] think of it like trying to understand
[00:04:45] what a place looks like by looking at a
[00:04:48] photo of it for a really long time
[00:04:50] versus being able to visit the actual
[00:04:52] place and explore and look around seeing
[00:04:55] something from multiple angles helps you
[00:04:59] understand each of those angles much
[00:05:01] more easily and more quickly and more
[00:05:02] memorably and speaking of which if you
[00:05:05] found that this is an angle on learning
[00:05:07] that you found helpful then I'd
[00:05:08] appreciate if you give this video a like
[00:05:10] every like helps with the algorithm
[00:05:12] which helps me make more content for
[00:05:14] free now this inter leave method is
[00:05:15] really different to how I used to study
[00:05:17] when I was in my early years of uni I
[00:05:19] used to have these really big revision
[00:05:21] days where I'd sit down once a week for
[00:05:23] like 6 or 7 hours and try to get through
[00:05:25] as much of one paper as possible and is
[00:05:28] to create these huge huge summary pages
[00:05:30] and brain dumps on like the whole week
[00:05:32] or fortn night's worth of lectures and
[00:05:34] the end of the session I'd have this
[00:05:36] beautiful summary page like perfectly
[00:05:38] you know all the headings and completely
[00:05:40] organized and the nice tables and
[00:05:42] everything sometimes I'd even print them
[00:05:43] out and like create my own little like
[00:05:45] mini textbook but fast forward a few
[00:05:47] weeks and I'm looking at these Pages
[00:05:49] wondering where all the knowledge went
[00:05:51] and even though I knew I had a good
[00:05:54] basic understanding of all the facts I
[00:05:55] had good fact recall I was confident in
[00:05:57] that knowledge I knew knew that when I
[00:06:00] walked into the exam there would still
[00:06:02] be some questions that I'm going to get
[00:06:05] wrong that I cannot answer there's an
[00:06:06] angle that I have not considered and I
[00:06:09] have not looked at and I don't know what
[00:06:10] it is but it's like a fact of the
[00:06:11] universe there's going to be something
[00:06:13] that I get wrong now the reason
[00:06:15] interleaving is relevant here is because
[00:06:18] interleaving actually directly helps to
[00:06:20] protect you against those tricky
[00:06:22] curveball questions by helping you see
[00:06:25] more of those angles that you otherwise
[00:06:27] may have missed and it isn't incredibly
[00:06:30] effective there's a lot of ongoing
[00:06:32] research on interleaving researchers
[00:06:34] still don't exactly know what inter
[00:06:37] leing is and exactly how it works based
[00:06:40] on the pace of the research it's
[00:06:41] probably going to be at least another 10
[00:06:43] years before we know that a recent
[00:06:44] systematic review and met analysis on
[00:06:46] inter leaving found a Hedges G value of
[00:06:50] effect size at
[00:06:52] 0.65 for memory improvement and transfer
[00:06:56] transfer is what we call your ability to
[00:06:59] take what you've already learned and use
[00:07:01] that to learn new things that you
[00:07:02] haven't encountered before and a value
[00:07:04] of
[00:07:05] 0.65 is considered moderately strong and
[00:07:09] you might be thinking moderately strong
[00:07:12] doesn't sound that impressive but you
[00:07:15] would be wrong learning is really
[00:07:16] complicated and there are a lot of
[00:07:18] things that influence your learning
[00:07:20] there are very very few techniques where
[00:07:23] a single technique is able to have that
[00:07:27] level of impact for reference some
[00:07:29] Studies have found that just writing
[00:07:32] notes the general idea of writing notes
[00:07:36] only has an effect size of around
[00:07:38] 0.5 and simply rereading and rewriting
[00:07:41] notes has an effect size of around 0.2
[00:07:44] to
[00:07:45] 0.3 even spacing combined with free
[00:07:48] active recoil which is where you review
[00:07:51] something and then you wait a little
[00:07:53] while and then you review it again from
[00:07:55] memory which is considered one of the
[00:07:58] most effective strategies that's ever
[00:08:01] been found it is like the only strategy
[00:08:03] that people swear by on YouTube and it
[00:08:06] is the underlying concept that basically
[00:08:08] all flashcard apps are built around has
[00:08:10] an effect size hovering at around 0.8
[00:08:13] which is not that much greater than
[00:08:15] interleaving so if you were to combined
[00:08:17] spaced active recoil with interleaving
[00:08:21] you are going to have a noticeable and
[00:08:23] probably significant Improvement in your
[00:08:25] ability to learn new information now
[00:08:27] unfortunately unlike spacing active
[00:08:29] recall where there's a lot of research
[00:08:30] and we generally know when it works and
[00:08:32] when it doesn't work interent leaving is
[00:08:34] something that we are still not really
[00:08:36] sure about we don't know exactly what
[00:08:38] you need to do to make it perfectly
[00:08:41] effective and we do know that in some
[00:08:43] situations when you do it wrong there is
[00:08:45] literally no effect and in some cases
[00:08:47] just because it's wasting time it's more
[00:08:49] harmful but I've been using this method
[00:08:50] for several years now and I've also been
[00:08:53] teaching this to tens of thousands of
[00:08:55] students so I've had the chance to see
[00:08:57] what works and what doesn't and so here
[00:08:59] are my rules for using interleaving to
[00:09:02] make it as effective as it can be number
[00:09:05] one make yourself compare and contrast
[00:09:08] if the way you're doing inter leaving is
[00:09:10] not actually helping you compare and
[00:09:13] contrast variations of different
[00:09:15] concepts and figure out exactly what a
[00:09:17] concept is versus what a concept is not
[00:09:20] then it's probably not going to help you
[00:09:22] and to do this you're going to want to
[00:09:23] test yourself in different ways use a
[00:09:25] multitude of different techniques to
[00:09:27] test your knowledge you do want to test
[00:09:31] your memory repeatedly but you do not
[00:09:34] want to repeatedly use the same method
[00:09:37] to test your memory every time you have
[00:09:40] a revision session use a different
[00:09:42] technique that helps you explore the
[00:09:44] concept from a different angle to
[00:09:46] explore New Perspectives I have many
[00:09:48] other videos talking about different
[00:09:49] methods of revision that all can be
[00:09:51] plugged into this and I will continue to
[00:09:52] upload more videos talking about
[00:09:54] different methods moving into the future
[00:09:56] so if you haven't already that's a
[00:09:58] reason that maybe you should subscribe
[00:10:00] number two look for variations rather
[00:10:03] than totally new Concepts you can't just
[00:10:06] take two random topics and mash them
[00:10:08] together and call that into leaving the
[00:10:10] different concepts or facts or angles
[00:10:12] that you are cycling between have to be
[00:10:15] similar enough that there is
[00:10:17] similarities between them but different
[00:10:20] enough that you can actually distinguish
[00:10:22] them apart for example in biology
[00:10:23] mitosis and meiosis are two different
[00:10:25] types of cell division and those two
[00:10:27] would be good Concepts that you can
[00:10:29] inter leave between because there is a
[00:10:31] lot of similarities but there are also
[00:10:32] very distinct differences between the
[00:10:35] two to tell them apart however if you
[00:10:36] were to compare mitosis with
[00:10:39] photosynthesis that probably is not
[00:10:41] going to be very useful because they're
[00:10:43] very very different and the similarities
[00:10:46] are very general and Abstract on the
[00:10:49] other hand let's say that you were
[00:10:50] studying some kind of uh legal policy
[00:10:53] and you're interleaving between policy a
[00:10:55] and policy B and the two of them are so
[00:10:58] so similar that even when you're
[00:11:00] comparing them side by side it's hard to
[00:11:02] know which is which in this situation
[00:11:05] it's very hard to actually spot the
[00:11:07] differences and tell them apart and that
[00:11:09] can actually just add confusion so that
[00:11:10] would be a situation that is too similar
[00:11:13] for there to be effective inter leaving
[00:11:15] you're not always going to be able to
[00:11:17] find a way to inter leave literally
[00:11:19] every single concept that you learn but
[00:11:21] what I found is that for most topics
[00:11:24] every concept can be looked at at least
[00:11:28] from another angle or is related to
[00:11:32] another concept within that same topic
[00:11:34] very closely and I think by virtue of it
[00:11:36] being within the same topic there are
[00:11:38] not many situations where you've got a
[00:11:40] concept that you literally cannot
[00:11:42] compare in contrast with anything else
[00:11:44] because it is just so isolated and
[00:11:46] removed from every other concept rule
[00:11:48] number three try to force these compare
[00:11:51] and contrast into leaving opportunities
[00:11:53] frequently don't spend one day studying
[00:11:56] a concept and then another day studying
[00:11:59] the variation and try to compare in
[00:12:00] contrast the research says that the
[00:12:02] benefit of interleaving seems to fade
[00:12:05] when the gap between interleaving
[00:12:07] sessions grows further apart it's also
[00:12:10] much more confusing and overwhelming
[00:12:12] because now you have to compare and
[00:12:13] contrast and look for similarities and
[00:12:14] differences between a whole day's worth
[00:12:16] of studying and another whole day's
[00:12:19] worth of studying it is much easier
[00:12:21] practical less overwhelming and actually
[00:12:23] just more beneficial to compare and
[00:12:26] contrast ideas every 10 to 15 15 minutes
[00:12:29] you should take a single example single
[00:12:32] variation single concept that is fresh
[00:12:35] in your memory and immediately compare
[00:12:37] and contrast that to its variation or
[00:12:40] other related concept again you want to
[00:12:43] avoid learning too much before you
[00:12:45] compare and contrast because that's
[00:12:47] going to create a lot of overwhelm and
[00:12:49] confusion and that ties in directly with
[00:12:51] number four which is to build your
[00:12:53] knowledge over time interleaving is very
[00:12:56] effective but when you study with a lot
[00:12:57] of interleaving you you will find that
[00:12:59] you're not feeling your knowledge
[00:13:01] growing as quickly as you may have felt
[00:13:05] with your previous technique this is
[00:13:06] because when we're inter leaving we're
[00:13:08] building our knowledge like filling a
[00:13:10] bathtub rather than filling a test tube
[00:13:13] when we learn one thing very narrow very
[00:13:16] deep and completely understand it before
[00:13:18] moving on we can feel like our knowledge
[00:13:21] is growing very quickly because we can
[00:13:22] see our knowledge level rising very
[00:13:25] quickly but this is actually an illusion
[00:13:28] of confidence it's because that
[00:13:29] knowledge is very fragile and not well
[00:13:33] supported by anything around it so it's
[00:13:35] more likely to fade we're more likely to
[00:13:37] have errors and we're more likely to get
[00:13:39] back to a week later and realize we're
[00:13:40] forgotten half of it but when we learn
[00:13:42] with interleaving and most of the other
[00:13:44] strategies also that I talk about in my
[00:13:46] other videos it creates knowledge like
[00:13:48] filling a bathtub even if you've got the
[00:13:50] water on full blast you don't really see
[00:13:53] the water level rising very quickly even
[00:13:55] though the actual volume that is being
[00:13:58] filled is much much more substantial
[00:13:59] when you apply these cycles of
[00:14:01] interleaving where each cycle is more in
[00:14:03] depth and more detailed you will feel
[00:14:06] that your knowledge improves every cycle
[00:14:09] rather than every individual concept and
[00:14:12] I promise trust me by the end of the day
[00:14:15] when you've done three or four Cycles
[00:14:18] you will feel that your knowledge is
[00:14:20] much more stable and much more robustly
[00:14:23] understood than you would have felt with
[00:14:25] your previous method of studying now
[00:14:26] just as a disclaimer even if you do all
[00:14:29] this and then you follow all these rules
[00:14:30] and you're perfect with interleaving
[00:14:31] interleaving and retrieval are still
[00:14:35] just one side of the coin you still need
[00:14:38] high quality encoding to make sure that
[00:14:40] You' have encoded the information into
[00:14:42] your memory properly in the first place
[00:14:44] and that is actually probably the
[00:14:46] biggest bottleneck for most students The
[00:14:48] Learning System of an efficient learner
[00:14:51] should have both high quality encoding
[00:14:53] and high quality retrieval with
[00:14:56] interleaving now if you would like to
[00:14:57] know how good your Learning System is
[00:15:00] then I've actually created a quiz that
[00:15:01] you can do for free there's a link in
[00:15:03] the description you answer a bunch of
[00:15:04] questions it tells you what your
[00:15:05] strengths and weaknesses are and also
[00:15:07] leave a few links in the description
[00:15:08] about videos to do with different
[00:15:10] retrieval and revision strategies that
[00:15:12] you might want to plug into your into
[00:15:14] leaving straight away let me know how
[00:15:15] you get along thanks for watching and
[00:15:16] I'll see you next
[00:15:19] [Music]
[00:15:22] time


=== Why is your memory always bad ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpgTeIxbqoU

[00:00:00] if you do not know these four things you
[00:00:02] will really struggle to do well and then
[00:00:04] you're going to end up wasting a lot of
[00:00:05] time and effort the first thing is that
[00:00:07] your memory like how having a good
[00:00:09] memory or a bad memory is actually just
[00:00:11] a symptom it's not about how intelligent
[00:00:13] you are for example when a baby is born
[00:00:16] every baby has roughly the same like
[00:00:18] good or bad memory quality of memory how
[00:00:20] good you remember something is just a
[00:00:23] symptom of the process you use and how
[00:00:25] you thought about it when you learned it
[00:00:28] and if you think about it in the wrong
[00:00:30] way your memory will always be bad and
[00:00:32] if you think about it in the right way
[00:00:34] your memory will consistently be good
[00:00:36] and this is what we know from the latest
[00:00:38] research on learning science that's the
[00:00:39] first thing your memory is a symptom so
[00:00:41] don't you know go home open up your tub
[00:00:43] of ice cream for the you know fourth
[00:00:44] time this week and cry yourself or
[00:00:46] eating ice cream thinking oh my memory
[00:00:47] is so bad I can never do this it's not
[00:00:49] that your memory is bad it's that your
[00:00:51] methods may not be Suited


=== What is good note taking? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSjcnyHFDYQ

[00:00:00] often the attitude we have towards
[00:00:01] writing notes is just on the page out of
[00:00:03] mind we don't really think about it we
[00:00:04] just dump it in our notes so we feel
[00:00:06] better who does that I used to spend
[00:00:08] hours every day studying by writing
[00:00:10] notes and learn nothing good note taking
[00:00:13] should help our brain think not help it
[00:00:16] avoid thinking so don't write notes left
[00:00:18] to right sequentially down the page I
[00:00:20] call this linear note taking the problem
[00:00:22] is that knowledge is not linear so it's
[00:00:24] very difficult to express groups and
[00:00:26] relationships with linear notes so
[00:00:27] experiment with some nonlinear methods
[00:00:30] of note taking but even software and
[00:00:32] apps that can form maps and groups for
[00:00:34] us can make it too passive we don't want
[00:00:37] relationships and lines and arrows to
[00:00:38] appear at the Press of a button we need
[00:00:40] to think about what groups we want to
[00:00:42] form whether we want an arrow here even
[00:00:44] how thick we want to draw the arrow if
[00:00:46] it's more or less important because
[00:00:47] that's what higher order learning
[00:00:48] involves


=== The MOST effective study strategy you could use ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgVyc1vdyNM

[00:00:00] back when I was in high school I was
[00:00:01] really into techwondo very Korean I know
[00:00:04] and we used to this drill where we' hold
[00:00:06] up a pad and then someone would kick it
[00:00:08] but we'd vary it up we'd hold it higher
[00:00:10] we'd hold it lower sometimes closer to
[00:00:12] them sometimes further away and would'
[00:00:14] make them react and these droes were
[00:00:16] really helpful because it trained my
[00:00:18] ability to use that kick in any scenario
[00:00:21] in any situation but this is really
[00:00:22] relevant for studying as well because
[00:00:24] when we're studying a concept we
[00:00:26] shouldn't just hit it from one angle
[00:00:29] until we're full understood it there's a
[00:00:31] technique called interleaving which is
[00:00:33] one of the most effective studying
[00:00:35] strategies that you can use it improves
[00:00:37] your memory it improves your test
[00:00:38] performance it improves your ability to
[00:00:40] answer curveball questions and the way
[00:00:43] that you do this is that instead of
[00:00:44] understanding one thing fully and then
[00:00:46] moving on to another thing fully where
[00:00:49] you're probably going to get an exam
[00:00:50] question that throws you off you're now
[00:00:53] learning by exploring something from
[00:00:55] multiple angles constantly


=== What do doctors do in private practices. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uClmS2fE0Mk

[00:00:00] every every doctor knows this is that
[00:00:01] when you go to like a private hospital
[00:00:02] and you look at the surgical volume that
[00:00:04] they're doing like they are churning
[00:00:05] through cases literally like five to
[00:00:08] sometimes 10 times the speed of a public
[00:00:10] Hospital you know and so there's
[00:00:11] obviously a lot more organizational
[00:00:12] efficiency there but then I thought like
[00:00:14] is that what I want to do like it's
[00:00:15] being a private surgeon what I want to
[00:00:16] do again because I said well the primary
[00:00:18] outcome is not just to be like really
[00:00:20] really rich the the primary outcome is
[00:00:21] to find like that fulfillment and
[00:00:22] satisfaction in my life every time I
[00:00:24] went to these private clinics and I
[00:00:25] thought what they're doing it just it
[00:00:26] didn't really feel honestly it felt
[00:00:28] really boring to me like I don't want to
[00:00:29] do 10,000 laparoscopic surgeries a year
[00:00:32] and that's all I do


=== How do I cram a textbook in 3 days ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogUJZHY6GY4

[00:00:00] I've got 900 pages of this textbook I
[00:00:02] still need to study in the next 3 days
[00:00:04] and I'm going to spend my time and
[00:00:06] effort on day one going through the
[00:00:08] entire 800 Pages Yes you heard me
[00:00:10] correctly I'm going to go through 800
[00:00:12] pages in a single day but the volume of
[00:00:14] information I go through is going to be
[00:00:16] the equivalent of maybe 75 Pages 100
[00:00:19] Pages it's still quite a lot but I've
[00:00:20] got 6 hours remember so I'm going to go
[00:00:22] through roughly let's say 100 Pages
[00:00:24] worth of actual knowledge but that's
[00:00:26] going to be the knowledge spread within
[00:00:27] this entire book that is the most Rel
[00:00:30] for me that makes the most sense it's
[00:00:31] the easiest for me to understand and
[00:00:33] wrap my head around that's going to
[00:00:34] create a lot of anchor points it's going
[00:00:36] to create a really strong schema a
[00:00:37] really strong foundation for me to start
[00:00:39] working from


=== How learning how to learn can change a student's self confidence ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiDtZALZiL0

[00:00:00] Sarah bright bubbly pink shirt Sarah
[00:00:02] just starts crying and I was taken back
[00:00:04] that that had never happened to me
[00:00:05] before I'd done so many consultations
[00:00:06] and that never happened and I was like
[00:00:07] oh my god did I do something wrong like
[00:00:09] did I did I say something that I
[00:00:10] shouldn't have and then Sarah just looks
[00:00:12] at me and she says I thought I was just
[00:00:15] dumb so so Sarah had internalized this
[00:00:18] idea that the reason she struggled was
[00:00:20] not because there was something wrong
[00:00:21] with her methods cuz she was just doing
[00:00:22] the same thing that all of her friends
[00:00:23] were doing it was just what you do but
[00:00:24] she just decided that because I'm doing
[00:00:26] what my friends are doing and I'm not
[00:00:27] getting these great amazing results that
[00:00:29] all my friends are getting I must just
[00:00:30] be an idiot the only time learning
[00:00:32] becomes really difficult and challenging
[00:00:34] and it's a struggle and we find like
[00:00:36] we're combating our our memory and we
[00:00:38] not able to apply the knowledge properly
[00:00:40] is when we didn't do the learning right
[00:00:42] at the time


=== Why open exams are good ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBpX6Sceow

[00:00:00] open book exams open book exams I'm
[00:00:02] going to say like for goodness of
[00:00:03] education is underrated massively
[00:00:05] underrated because it's more realistic
[00:00:07] to how you actually need to access
[00:00:09] information and it means that it places
[00:00:10] pressure on higher order learning rather
[00:00:13] than just memorizing stuff because you
[00:00:15] know that you'll just be have to look
[00:00:16] that up the problem is people don't know
[00:00:17] how to study in that way


=== How I completed my master in 3 weeks and got high distinction ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqeDiY2LnEo

[00:00:00] I wanted to complete the master of
[00:00:01] education in just the shortest period of
[00:00:02] time and see what's the least amount of
[00:00:05] time I could spend on this program while
[00:00:07] still achieving the highest possible
[00:00:08] grades so I managed to finish the master
[00:00:10] of education about a 20th of the time so
[00:00:12] I think I spent around 3 weeks in total
[00:00:16] studying and doing the assignments for
[00:00:17] the master of education program I did
[00:00:18] manage to get high distinction for all
[00:00:20] of the assessments so now what I do is I
[00:00:23] work full-time just as a learning coach
[00:00:25] and a learning consultant I work with
[00:00:27] Learners from all different ages really
[00:00:29] young you early adolescence all the way
[00:00:31] through to people that are in their 70s
[00:00:33] and 80s even I think my older student is
[00:00:35] 82 these are people that are maybe
[00:00:37] changing careers or they're going back
[00:00:38] to University or they're sort of
[00:00:40] recertifying in their degrees and things
[00:00:42] like that and it's about teaching them
[00:00:44] efficient learning skills so they can
[00:00:46] achieve their learning goals without
[00:00:47] having to sacrifice their friends or
[00:00:49] their family or their their work or
[00:00:51] their performance or something like that


=== Why grouping in your mind maps is so important ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov2N30n0Ccs

[00:00:00] I group the types only or do i group
[00:00:02] also the sub part everything that can be
[00:00:04] grouped you should group you just think
[00:00:05] about it this way when you group it and
[00:00:07] simplify it your memory gets better
[00:00:08] always for anything so if you can you
[00:00:11] always should and it's only if you can't
[00:00:14] then you put it onto flash cards or
[00:00:16] something anytime you can for any kind
[00:00:18] of information you should always try to
[00:00:20] find a way that makes you able to group
[00:00:23] it and simplify it and connect it and
[00:00:24] often can't versus don't want to get
[00:00:27] confused I think this is a good example
[00:00:29] here this
[00:00:30] you can but you didn't this here you
[00:00:32] could but you didn't so it's about what
[00:00:34] you say is acceptable versus not
[00:00:36] acceptable


=== Don't study until 5am. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAF3WIsxJi4

[00:00:00] I used to study more than 20 hours every
[00:00:01] day I used to wake up at 7:00 and I used
[00:00:03] to go to sleep at 5:00 and every single
[00:00:04] day every single weekend I did that for
[00:00:06] months consecutively basically never
[00:00:08] took any time off in fact I actually
[00:00:09] started hallucinating sometimes cuz I
[00:00:11] was so sleep deprived um and I was very
[00:00:13] obviously very very unhealthy you know
[00:00:15] mentally emotionally I just you know
[00:00:16] very not good as well so when I entered
[00:00:18] into medical school I knew that one
[00:00:20] thing that was very important for me was
[00:00:21] that I would have to be able to do my
[00:00:24] work and actually pass but also feel
[00:00:26] like I wasn't dying and so efficiency
[00:00:28] was something that became very important
[00:00:30] for me and so I wanted to go to the gym
[00:00:31] I wanted to dance by the time I'd
[00:00:33] graduated I'd sort of created the system
[00:00:35] of how I could read through sort of
[00:00:38] hundreds or thousands of papers and sort
[00:00:39] of synthesize ideas and then how I could
[00:00:41] manage my textbook lecture learning for
[00:00:44] medical school and how I could kind of
[00:00:45] manage all of that in a way that was
[00:00:47] efficient


=== DON'T make this mistake with your mind maps ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fqj6yKgU0

[00:00:00] you've got nine different concepts and
[00:00:01] now you're trying to simplify it you've
[00:00:03] lift it too long that's why you want to
[00:00:05] simplify the information as you go you
[00:00:07] take a concept you simplify it you take
[00:00:09] a concept you simplify the big picture
[00:00:11] is forming all the time but if you just
[00:00:13] like focus on like one specific little
[00:00:15] network of information like if you look
[00:00:17] at your mind maps like this one if you
[00:00:18] just just focus on like this part here
[00:00:20] for like 20 minutes and then you zoom
[00:00:22] out and you think okay well how is that
[00:00:23] related to everything else now it's
[00:00:25] overwhelming because you've got a lot
[00:00:26] that you need to try to integrate with
[00:00:28] everything else but instead it should be
[00:00:29] like okay I've added this one and I've
[00:00:30] added this one now you zoom out how does
[00:00:32] that relate to everything now I've added
[00:00:34] this and then this how does that relate
[00:00:35] to everything if you just continue to
[00:00:37] integrate it with the big picture at
[00:00:38] every step it's not very overwhelming


=== Why I left clinical medicine ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXq--14nJx0

[00:00:00] when I left clinical medicine not many
[00:00:02] doctors asked me why they were mostly
[00:00:03] just like how I think every medical
[00:00:06] person knows why someone would leave
[00:00:08] clinical practice working as a doctor
[00:00:10] was very like demotivating because I
[00:00:11] felt so powerless to do so many of the
[00:00:14] things that I wanted to do with my work
[00:00:15] or the type of impact or even just
[00:00:17] simple things like if I want to go to a
[00:00:18] friend's wedding like I shouldn't need
[00:00:19] to get leave seven different times
[00:00:21] across you know 4 months just to be able
[00:00:23] to hit that I hated the idea of waking
[00:00:25] up in a Sunday and thinking like oh crap
[00:00:27] it's Sunday like I have to get up for
[00:00:29] work tomorrow morning you know it's a
[00:00:30] Monday and then like counting down the
[00:00:31] days until the weekend which I not I
[00:00:33] know that not everyone is like that but
[00:00:34] for me that's the experience that I had
[00:00:36] when I was working as a doctor I really
[00:00:37] dreaded the work and if I thought like
[00:00:39] yeah it's I guess it's okay and then I
[00:00:40] thought well would I rather just be at
[00:00:41] home


=== Don't do copy, cover, check. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9gYo1BO8Rs

[00:00:00] it looks like reading and repeating
[00:00:01] things three C's this is called cover
[00:00:03] copy check it's when you read something
[00:00:06] you cover it up you try to copy it up
[00:00:08] from memory and then you check if you
[00:00:09] got it right or not that's a very very
[00:00:11] simple strategy that's not going to be
[00:00:12] very effective just flash cards
[00:00:14] basically just putting information down
[00:00:16] just trying to memorize it going over it
[00:00:18] again and again that's not going to be
[00:00:19] very effective copying other people's
[00:00:21] notes or just generally writing out lots
[00:00:23] of notes or writing it out again and
[00:00:25] again these are all techniques that are
[00:00:26] pre- structural you can't get higher
[00:00:28] level of knowledge using the strategies


=== How to study as a professional athlete with 30 hour weekly training ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttTKE_kGKCs

[00:00:00] when I work with athletes I previously
[00:00:02] worked with a international level
[00:00:03] competitive athlete and she had a 30h
[00:00:05] hour per week training schedule a
[00:00:07] minimum that was like during the the
[00:00:09] quiet quiet Seasons she was also trying
[00:00:11] to enter into Medical School crazy
[00:00:13] workload as well the method of learning
[00:00:15] that she had to use had to be extremely
[00:00:17] extremely extremely efficient it takes
[00:00:19] time to get to that point of efficiency
[00:00:20] and that's the hard part is that between
[00:00:23] now and the point where you've solved
[00:00:24] the problem because you're that much
[00:00:26] more efficient it's going to kind of
[00:00:28] suck a little bit cuz you're going to
[00:00:29] have to try really hard and you're going
[00:00:30] to have to spend that time to build the
[00:00:31] system but gradually week by week by
[00:00:34] week you'll be freeing up a little bit
[00:00:36] more time for yourself


=== How to use mind maps WITHOUT feeling overloaded ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdz1oeU6HMA

[00:00:00] as you continue to learn more every time
[00:00:02] you increase the amount of Concepts and
[00:00:04] key wordss that you're thinking about or
[00:00:06] facts or details what's happening is
[00:00:07] that you're getting more things to think
[00:00:09] about and you're getting continually
[00:00:11] continually overloaded this is what's
[00:00:13] causing you to feel overwhelmed cuz you
[00:00:14] enter into cognitive overload thing that
[00:00:16] prevents that overload is going to be
[00:00:18] the effort spent on creating groups and
[00:00:20] getting to the point where it feels
[00:00:22] simple enough so every time you feel
[00:00:24] overloaded you spend your effort to
[00:00:25] group it and then try to simplify it and
[00:00:27] then that will make it so that your
[00:00:29] mental effort it is lower and now you're
[00:00:31] ready to take on the next piece of
[00:00:32] information and then you do the same
[00:00:34] thing


=== Create better mind maps with this simple trick ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-huU3-tgUU

[00:00:00] one of the big things is you have to be
[00:00:01] grouping and chunking more most of your
[00:00:03] relationships are just between
[00:00:04] individual ideas you've got a couple big
[00:00:07] groups here and there it's like flows
[00:00:09] yes it flows and which is not a bad
[00:00:11] thing but the idea is that your flow is
[00:00:13] just concept to concept to concept to
[00:00:15] concept to concept so the idea is that
[00:00:17] when you know that there are things that
[00:00:18] are related together instead of just
[00:00:20] saying yes they're related they're
[00:00:22] related like that you should say okay
[00:00:23] well they're all related together so
[00:00:24] therefore I need to chunk it and I need
[00:00:26] to group it and then now you've just got
[00:00:27] one thing to work with instead and then
[00:00:29] now it might be like that so this can
[00:00:31] help with a backbone right yes this
[00:00:33] directly helps with building that better
[00:00:35] backbone a bigger schema


=== Why mind maps can feel OVERWHELMING ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9riNmqmlI

[00:00:00] you're going to take one particular
[00:00:01] concept and then that concept is now
[00:00:02] going to be in your head and then you
[00:00:04] think well how is this concept related
[00:00:05] to now the next concept and then you
[00:00:07] might be able to create some kind of
[00:00:08] Arrow and then as you continue to expand
[00:00:10] out you can add more arrows and more
[00:00:12] relationships and things like that and
[00:00:14] then as you continue to progress this
[00:00:16] map is going to have more things added
[00:00:19] on to it and every time there's a new
[00:00:20] thing that's added on you now need to
[00:00:22] think how it's all related to everything
[00:00:23] else and so there's a lot for your brain
[00:00:25] to try to hold on to each of these
[00:00:27] arrows is something that your brain has
[00:00:29] to sort of hold on to in order to
[00:00:31] process and when it gets too much that's
[00:00:33] when you'll start feeling overwhelmed
[00:00:34] and then now it doesn't even matter if
[00:00:36] there's any new content that comes in
[00:00:37] you're not going to know how to think
[00:00:38] about it because each new piece of
[00:00:40] information has so many different
[00:00:42] possible things to think about that it's
[00:00:45] just overwhelming and that's not
[00:00:46] realistic the reason this happens is
[00:00:48] because you are progressing through the
[00:00:51] mapping too quickly you're adding on New
[00:00:54] Concepts before your existing structure
[00:00:57] is consolidated


=== How to memorize your textbook ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=363lUlVeGzA

[00:00:00] if you are reading a 500 pages book
[00:00:03] after 1 month you tend to forget
[00:00:05] everything what is the effective way to
[00:00:07] retrieve the info yeah so memory is a
[00:00:10] symptom right memory is a symptom so if
[00:00:12] you're forgetting a lot it means that
[00:00:13] the process you use was not the right
[00:00:14] process probably means you're looking at
[00:00:16] the pieces let's say that I read 500
[00:00:17] pages and then some random person off
[00:00:19] the street reads 500 pages after 1 month
[00:00:22] we set an exam who would you guess will
[00:00:24] probably do better in the exam me or the
[00:00:25] random person I'm hoping you would say
[00:00:27] me because you're here at my workshop
[00:00:30] thank you by the way so clearly there's
[00:00:32] a difference in the process and this is
[00:00:34] what science says Neuroscience says to
[00:00:36] some degree predict the quality and
[00:00:38] retention of someone's knowledge in the
[00:00:39] future based on the process they use
[00:00:41] today

[No transcript available]


=== How to Study With Me (Instructions) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEcEcojR4

[00:00:00] hey everyone it's Justin here this is a
[00:00:02] instruction video for the guided study
[00:00:06] with me that I've created you can find a
[00:00:08] link to that one in the description the
[00:00:10] idea is that you watch the guided study
[00:00:13] with me video while you are studying and
[00:00:15] it's going to go through the timings and
[00:00:17] what you should do at each stage and
[00:00:18] then you can well study with me I guess
[00:00:22] uh and then this video is the one that
[00:00:24] tells you what to do during those phases
[00:00:27] the difference between normal study with
[00:00:29] MES and then the one that I've created
[00:00:31] is that the techniques are not the most
[00:00:34] straightforward or intuitive to use
[00:00:36] unless you've already had prior training
[00:00:37] or you've been watching a lot of my
[00:00:39] content so I'm going to go through and
[00:00:41] explain how that guided study with me is
[00:00:43] structured why it's structured that way
[00:00:46] what you should do at each phase and you
[00:00:47] can go away and watch that study with me
[00:00:50] video while you're actually studying and
[00:00:52] not get distracted by uh explanations
[00:00:56] and instructions during it so the idea
[00:00:59] with that study was with me is that it's
[00:01:00] broken up into a couple of different
[00:01:02] phases the first thing is the general
[00:01:05] prep phase and during the prep phase uh
[00:01:09] it's just about making sure that we're
[00:01:10] in the best situation before we start
[00:01:13] studying what we're really talking about
[00:01:14] here is optimizing our
[00:01:17] environment so making sure that we've
[00:01:19] got a nice workpace distraction free uh
[00:01:24] you know we're able to focus in I would
[00:01:27] recommend having something like water or
[00:01:30] tea or coffee or something with you I
[00:01:32] usually like to have one hot beverage
[00:01:35] and then one cold beverage it just makes
[00:01:37] me feel good don't ask me why the next
[00:01:40] thing is to make sure that we are
[00:01:41] proactively trying to eliminate any
[00:01:43] distractions that we can predict so this
[00:01:45] means putting your phone and things on
[00:01:47] do not disturb your computer on do not
[00:01:49] disturb telling people that maybe
[00:01:52] physically around you don't disturb me
[00:01:55] uh and just doing what you can to make
[00:01:56] sure that during your focus session
[00:01:58] there isn't going to be something
[00:02:00] preventable to take you out of flow the
[00:02:02] other thing that I'd recommend is that
[00:02:04] in that video there is some white noise
[00:02:06] that's playing as well this is designed
[00:02:08] to help you focus so I would recommend
[00:02:11] watching that video with headphones on
[00:02:14] if you can the next part after we've
[00:02:16] done the preparation is to do five deep
[00:02:21] breaths and the reason we're doing these
[00:02:23] five deep breaths is uh to create a
[00:02:27] focus ritual it's like a routine
[00:02:32] activity that you do before you enter
[00:02:34] into a focused State not only is there
[00:02:37] some evidence to say that really deep
[00:02:40] slow breaths is helpful for helping us
[00:02:44] focus and relax but it also can be
[00:02:48] created as almost like a prefocused
[00:02:51] ritual which means that the deep breaths
[00:02:54] over time slowly help us to condition
[00:02:56] ourselves into entering into that focus
[00:02:58] zone it's not enough just to do the deep
[00:03:00] breaths um you have to actually try to
[00:03:04] let yourself feel that as you breathing
[00:03:08] out you are getting a little bit more
[00:03:11] calm a little bit more focused and more
[00:03:13] zoned in with each breath I would also
[00:03:16] recommend doing a like Max inhalation
[00:03:20] and the way that you do this is you take
[00:03:21] a deep breath in you try to use your
[00:03:23] diaphragm to Brea breathe in so don't
[00:03:24] breathe in like like that but breathe in
[00:03:28] outwards you can't see cuz you can see
[00:03:31] here there you go so you're
[00:03:34] breathing outwards with the diaphragm um
[00:03:38] and then once you breath in all the way
[00:03:40] then you breathe in again
[00:03:43] so and then that allows you to get that
[00:03:45] extra level of inhalation to get that
[00:03:46] maximum breath and then a slow exhale
[00:03:50] and then you do that five times and
[00:03:51] across the each breath you try to think
[00:03:54] of yourself getting more and more
[00:03:56] focused in after you do your deep
[00:03:59] breaths
[00:04:00] which naturally doesn't take that long
[00:04:02] uh we're starting our first studying
[00:04:04] phase which is
[00:04:07] scoping scoping should only take a few
[00:04:10] minutes and the idea with scoping is
[00:04:12] that you're just going to go through
[00:04:14] your resources and you want to have
[00:04:16] really all of the resources laid out
[00:04:18] already this might be a textbook it
[00:04:20] could be a you know lecture slides it
[00:04:24] could be a um you know a course guide
[00:04:26] articles online whatever it is go
[00:04:29] through very very quickly and just pick
[00:04:32] out and write down what you think are
[00:04:34] the main most important Concepts so uh
[00:04:37] you you'd create essentially like a Word
[00:04:40] document you might type this out if
[00:04:41] you'd like with just a list of the most
[00:04:44] important Concepts and keywords you
[00:04:47] don't have to get it fully right it
[00:04:49] doesn't have to be like Mega
[00:04:52] comprehensive if you can get what seem
[00:04:54] like generally the most important that's
[00:04:57] going to be enough to work with again
[00:04:59] again you really can't do this part
[00:05:01] wrong I would recommend that if you're
[00:05:03] doing a reasonable study block aim to
[00:05:06] get at least 10 different keywords on
[00:05:09] this page and probably not more than 20
[00:05:11] or 30 so again it's not about getting
[00:05:14] every single bolded word on there it's
[00:05:16] about being a bit more Discerning about
[00:05:18] what you think is the most important and
[00:05:21] and starting with that so after we do
[00:05:23] that for a few minutes we're then moving
[00:05:25] on to the next step which I've talked
[00:05:28] about a lot of my other videos and I've
[00:05:29] decided to just give this a name which
[00:05:31] is called maybe
[00:05:33] mapping and I say maybe mapping because
[00:05:36] what you're doing here is just a
[00:05:38] hypothesis the idea with maybe mapping
[00:05:40] is that we're going to take the items
[00:05:43] and the keywords that we had just scoped
[00:05:46] out we're going to look through those
[00:05:48] words and we're going to create a
[00:05:50] hypothesis on how we think those words
[00:05:53] might be connected with each other we
[00:05:56] want to try to create some very basic
[00:05:59] scaffold that's a technical term for it
[00:06:02] the idea here is that it's just a maybe
[00:06:04] you don't have to be right in fact
[00:06:06] you're almost definitely going to be
[00:06:07] wrong but it's just getting our brain
[00:06:10] thinking about how it all fits together
[00:06:13] in a big picture and having that big
[00:06:16] picture reference point is going to be
[00:06:18] hugely beneficial as a priming step
[00:06:21] before we get into the deepest studying
[00:06:23] it's going to make content less
[00:06:24] overwhelming it's going to make our
[00:06:26] memory better it's one of the most
[00:06:28] beneficial things that you can do for
[00:06:29] studying and it's one of the things that
[00:06:32] less efficient Learners commonly skip
[00:06:35] because they don't understand the value
[00:06:36] of it they're just like oh I just need
[00:06:37] to get through the content I don't want
[00:06:38] to waste time doing this it's not a
[00:06:40] waste of time because when you invest
[00:06:42] your time to create a hypothetical
[00:06:44] scaffold and a mental model for you to
[00:06:47] think through even if it's wrong even if
[00:06:50] it's completely wrong there is a strong
[00:06:53] benefit to helping you manage and
[00:06:55] process any new information that comes
[00:06:58] in after that
[00:07:00] so uh just spend I would recommend
[00:07:03] spending around about 10 minutes or so
[00:07:05] trying to create a map you're going to
[00:07:08] be wrong try to do your best if there
[00:07:11] are words that you're looking at and you
[00:07:13] don't even understand the meaning of
[00:07:14] that word at all whatsoever then just do
[00:07:18] a very quick Google search and just read
[00:07:21] like literally a couple lines you should
[00:07:22] never be reading or thinking about it
[00:07:25] for more than like 30 seconds it's just
[00:07:27] enough for you to get a very very very
[00:07:30] general superficial understanding of
[00:07:32] that word to construct a maybe map and
[00:07:36] again it's not that you're trying to get
[00:07:38] it right it's that you're trying to
[00:07:41] figure it out create some kind of model
[00:07:44] and then you can work off of that if you
[00:07:47] find this process really difficult and
[00:07:49] you're like kind of paralyzed there not
[00:07:51] able to map anything out at all this is
[00:07:54] a very very high yield thing that you
[00:07:57] will need to work on it probably means
[00:07:59] that you're not used to relational
[00:08:01] thinking or higher Ro of learning in
[00:08:03] general and that's actually going to be
[00:08:04] a limitation for your studying
[00:08:05] efficiency for life this is something
[00:08:08] you have to learn to be able to do if
[00:08:10] you want to become a more efficient
[00:08:11] learner very black and white so after
[00:08:15] we've done a maybe map we should already
[00:08:17] have a general understanding about how
[00:08:19] some of these ideas might relate to each
[00:08:21] other and that can in some cases make us
[00:08:24] naturally more curious about it as well
[00:08:27] the next step after doing this is the EV
[00:08:29] valuation and this is the first round of
[00:08:31] evaluation that we're doing the
[00:08:33] evaluation is the part where we're now
[00:08:36] going to go through and learn more about
[00:08:38] each of the key wordss if you are more
[00:08:42] comfortable with this you can actually
[00:08:44] start at whatever keyword you feel is
[00:08:47] the most relevant for you if you're a
[00:08:50] beginner at thinking in this way just
[00:08:52] start at the beginning but every time
[00:08:54] you learn about one keyword or a concept
[00:08:58] I I want you to take a step back look at
[00:09:01] your overall picture and ask yourself
[00:09:04] how does this fit inside the overall
[00:09:08] picture and there are a number of
[00:09:10] objectives that I want you to have on
[00:09:12] the front of your mind you may want to
[00:09:14] even just have this like literally front
[00:09:18] and center on the study with me video
[00:09:20] you'll see that this actually pops up
[00:09:22] during the evaluation process all the
[00:09:24] time on screen so you've got it as
[00:09:26] reference the idea with evaluation is
[00:09:29] that you want to make sense of the
[00:09:31] information you want to make sense of it
[00:09:33] which means we're trying to make it more
[00:09:35] obvious we're trying to reduce our need
[00:09:38] for memorization so anything that you
[00:09:40] feel man I need to repeat this and do it
[00:09:42] again and again for me to stick it in my
[00:09:45] brain that's a red flag we want to think
[00:09:48] how could I think about this how could I
[00:09:51] connect it create an analogy for it
[00:09:55] integrated into a network so that I
[00:09:57] don't need to do that repetition or at
[00:10:00] least I don't feel like it's slipping
[00:10:02] away
[00:10:03] imminently so we're creating analogies
[00:10:06] we're actively comparing that concept
[00:10:09] with other Concepts and we're asking
[00:10:11] ourselves how does it fit in the big
[00:10:13] picture you want to do this after every
[00:10:17] concept or every keyword because if you
[00:10:20] go through three or four Concepts and
[00:10:22] then you take a step back to see how it
[00:10:24] integrates it's much more overwhelming
[00:10:26] because you've got so many more pieces
[00:10:28] that you have to try to think about it's
[00:10:30] much easier to say do one concept take a
[00:10:34] step back integrate it with the big
[00:10:36] picture see how that changes our mental
[00:10:38] model maybe if we've mapped it out first
[00:10:41] uh then we can we can redo
[00:10:43] it uh if you're at a point where your
[00:10:46] nonlinear note taking skills are still
[00:10:49] relatively new then this may be
[00:10:51] something that you find a little bit
[00:10:53] more challenging but just keep pushing
[00:10:55] at it nonlinear note taking again is one
[00:10:57] of those things that you really need to
[00:10:59] get good at because linear note taking
[00:11:01] is just so so limited if you have not
[00:11:05] even tried nonlinear note taking before
[00:11:07] in the first place then I would very
[00:11:09] strongly recommend checking out my video
[00:11:11] on uh nonlinear note taking before doing
[00:11:14] the study with me because otherwise you
[00:11:16] you're really going to struggle a lot so
[00:11:18] this evaluation process involves a lot
[00:11:21] of back and forth your going to your
[00:11:24] keyword list that you've created you're
[00:11:27] going to your textbook references or
[00:11:29] lecture slides or Google search you're
[00:11:31] exploring it and after you've understood
[00:11:34] that concept you're then straight away
[00:11:35] going okay take a step back how does
[00:11:37] that fit within my big picture you're
[00:11:39] remapping moving things around adding
[00:11:42] other arrows thinking about it a lot of
[00:11:44] this time is spent in your head just
[00:11:46] thinking and trying to put the puzzle
[00:11:48] together okay it should feel like you're
[00:11:50] trying to put a puzzle together and then
[00:11:53] once you feel like okay I think that's
[00:11:55] how it fits that makes sense to me then
[00:11:58] you're going to move on to the next
[00:11:59] keyword and then go back evaluate you
[00:12:03] know learn more about it and then add it
[00:12:05] to your map and then think okay well how
[00:12:07] does that fit with what I've already got
[00:12:09] on my map all the other things how does
[00:12:12] it fit in the big
[00:12:13] picture you know refine it a bit add
[00:12:15] more arrows move things around and then
[00:12:18] once you feel like that makes sense
[00:12:19] we're going back to the keyword so we're
[00:12:21] doing that process again and again a lot
[00:12:23] of this time is spent just in our heads
[00:12:25] thinking and then refining and
[00:12:27] consolidating and simplifying the map as
[00:12:30] we go you absolutely absolutely want to
[00:12:34] have the feeling that as you are
[00:12:35] learning more the map is becoming easier
[00:12:39] and simpler to understand the amount of
[00:12:42] overwhelm you feel should go down as you
[00:12:44] keep studying if you find that as you
[00:12:47] are studying it's getting harder and
[00:12:49] harder to keep track of what's going on
[00:12:51] it means that you're either not pulling
[00:12:53] out to look at the big picture and like
[00:12:56] often enough or when you are you're not
[00:12:59] simplifying it to a level that makes
[00:13:01] sense enough before you move on this is
[00:13:04] something that we call multiple element
[00:13:07] interactivity which is part of cognitive
[00:13:09] load Theory which is the idea that when
[00:13:11] there are too many things that our brain
[00:13:13] is trying to process it struggles and
[00:13:15] enters into overload which is a
[00:13:17] detrimental effect on our learning
[00:13:18] memory efficiency understanding so we
[00:13:21] want to make sure that when we learn
[00:13:23] something we're then exerting mental
[00:13:25] effort and time to simplify it and
[00:13:27] consolidate it to a point where we can
[00:13:29] look at it and think yep I feel like
[00:13:31] that makes sense to me and then we're
[00:13:34] ready to move on we don't want to just
[00:13:36] be overloading overloading overloading
[00:13:38] and overloading because even though we
[00:13:40] may be covering content physically very
[00:13:43] quickly in terms of what's happening in
[00:13:45] our brain we're actually going to be
[00:13:46] operating a very low efficiency and
[00:13:48] you're going to have to pay the
[00:13:49] consequences of that in future sessions
[00:13:52] because you forgot on half of everything
[00:13:53] that you've learned and that's
[00:13:54] ultimately the biggest waste of time so
[00:13:56] after we do our evaluation period which
[00:13:59] lasts usually at least 30 minutes maybe
[00:14:01] potentially more if you're really
[00:14:02] focused then we move on to questions
[00:14:05] when we do the questions part we want to
[00:14:08] deliberately think about what are the
[00:14:11] gaps in my knowledge right now what are
[00:14:13] the things I'm most curious about and if
[00:14:16] you're not really curious about
[00:14:17] something try to be curious about
[00:14:19] something and we're going to create a
[00:14:21] list of questions that are the most
[00:14:24] pressing on our mind that reflect the
[00:14:27] direction that we're thinking in because
[00:14:30] after the questions we're going to take
[00:14:32] a break so the questions are really good
[00:14:34] as almost like a here's a current
[00:14:37] snapshot of what I'm thinking about
[00:14:39] where I'm curious at where I want my
[00:14:41] mind to be directed towards and then
[00:14:43] when we come back into the session we
[00:14:45] can use the questions to springboard
[00:14:47] ourselves back into that deep Flow State
[00:14:50] very quickly and pick up from where we
[00:14:52] left off you can have you know as few as
[00:14:55] three or four questions I would probably
[00:14:57] not spend you know too long on this just
[00:15:00] a few minutes writing down some of the
[00:15:01] pertinent questions after we have
[00:15:04] written some questions we're now going
[00:15:05] to enter into an active relaxation
[00:15:08] period active relaxation means that we
[00:15:12] are doing something in our break the
[00:15:15] active relaxation part is important
[00:15:17] because we don't want to then go off and
[00:15:19] watch like a like your favorite Netflix
[00:15:21] show or uh get into like a really deep
[00:15:24] meaningful conversation with someone
[00:15:26] that's going to take ages or play your
[00:15:28] favorite online game those are not
[00:15:30] things that even though they may be
[00:15:32] relaxing they're not things that are
[00:15:33] going to help you to get back into a
[00:15:35] flow state after the break obviously if
[00:15:38] you don't have any more time to study
[00:15:39] and that's your session done you can go
[00:15:41] do whatever you want but if you need to
[00:15:43] come back into another session straight
[00:15:45] after this then uh you want to make sure
[00:15:48] you're doing something that's somewhat
[00:15:50] productive during this time but not
[00:15:52] mentally taxing so what that means is
[00:15:55] that this task needs to have a low level
[00:15:57] of
[00:15:59] cognitive load otherwise known as mental
[00:16:04] effort however it should be something
[00:16:07] that is generally productive a great
[00:16:10] example of this is actually housework
[00:16:13] cleaning your room organizing something
[00:16:15] these are methodical you could think of
[00:16:18] them as almost like tedious but mindful
[00:16:21] tasks that don't require lots of
[00:16:23] thinking if cleaning your room makes you
[00:16:26] Mega stressed then maybe
[00:16:29] don't do that do something else instead
[00:16:32] another really good one is to just take
[00:16:35] a walk go for a stroll getting some kind
[00:16:39] of movement or physical activity
[00:16:42] in is really
[00:16:44] beneficial and in fact you can even take
[00:16:47] the questions that you wrote before your
[00:16:49] break with you on a walk and then while
[00:16:52] you're walking just generally think
[00:16:54] about those questions and what the
[00:16:56] answers might be we're almost creating a
[00:16:58] mini maybe map just in our brain and
[00:17:02] again we don't want to be like super
[00:17:04] super focused on this we do want our
[00:17:05] brain a chance to just relax cool off
[00:17:08] but still stay in that productive
[00:17:10] intentional mode once our active
[00:17:13] relaxation time is up we're then going
[00:17:15] to move back into the next session and
[00:17:17] as before we want to start with having
[00:17:20] some nice deep
[00:17:23] breaths and just as before trying to get
[00:17:26] into the Zone with each
[00:17:28] breath and then after your fifth breath
[00:17:31] we're then moving back in and this time
[00:17:34] we're starting straight with the
[00:17:36] questions that we had left over we'll
[00:17:39] spend some time to explore the questions
[00:17:41] and try to see what the answers to those
[00:17:43] questions are this may naturally lead
[00:17:47] you into the next phase which is another
[00:17:50] round of
[00:17:53] evaluation essentially what this means
[00:17:55] is that we're picking up from where we
[00:17:56] left off we're moving on to the the next
[00:17:58] key concept the next key word the next
[00:18:00] part in our material and we're going to
[00:18:03] just continue going through that exactly
[00:18:05] the same process as before and just
[00:18:07] continuing to build on our map and get a
[00:18:09] deeper and deeper understanding of
[00:18:11] things but still keeping things
[00:18:13] relatively big picture depth complexity
[00:18:17] technical detail these are things that
[00:18:19] happen in layers and only once you've
[00:18:22] got a broad understanding at a big
[00:18:25] picture then do we move on to a deeper
[00:18:28] understanding add a big picture and then
[00:18:30] we move into the progressive levels of
[00:18:32] detail you should never ever really be
[00:18:34] focused on F granular detail when you
[00:18:38] are first starting to learn something if
[00:18:41] you can't already explain it in simple
[00:18:44] terms don't move on to trying to explain
[00:18:47] it in more complex terms work with the
[00:18:49] simple one first Master the simple then
[00:18:52] Master the intermediate and then Master
[00:18:53] the advanced and work in that way across
[00:18:56] the entire topic and it's going to be
[00:18:58] much more beneficial for your learning
[00:18:59] efficiency as well as for your memory
[00:19:01] another thing that we can do during this
[00:19:02] evaluation period which is different to
[00:19:04] what we were doing before is that we can
[00:19:07] potentially start offloading some
[00:19:10] material if we need to onto a
[00:19:13] memorization tool such as flash cards so
[00:19:16] if there is a particular detail that you
[00:19:18] think this is really detailed I don't
[00:19:21] see how it fits into the big picture
[00:19:23] really at all it just seems like a very
[00:19:26] very specific technical thing that I
[00:19:28] probably have to end up root memorizing
[00:19:30] then we can make the decision to then
[00:19:32] put that into our flash cards as we go
[00:19:36] and not have to worry about it too much
[00:19:38] we can continue to move through that big
[00:19:39] picture higher level conceptual stuff
[00:19:41] instead and again we do this process uh
[00:19:44] for the the bulk of the session and we
[00:19:46] move back into leaving ourselves some
[00:19:48] questions exactly like we did before
[00:19:51] thinking about where our gaps might be
[00:19:53] and then we move into another round of
[00:19:56] active relaxation and this cycle
[00:19:58] basically just repeats themselves this
[00:20:00] is a cycle that we would continue to
[00:20:02] work through every successive cycle and
[00:20:05] when we move on to a new topic that is
[00:20:08] now falling outside of what we initially
[00:20:10] had scoped out before then we would
[00:20:13] start again from this stage where we're
[00:20:16] actually scoping it and if obviously
[00:20:19] it's a whole new day a whole new session
[00:20:21] we have to start from the beginning
[00:20:22] where we're actually doing the
[00:20:23] preparation as well so this General
[00:20:26] cycle of studying is something that you
[00:20:28] can apply really for any subject that
[00:20:31] you're learning it is stronger for
[00:20:34] subjects that are conceptually very
[00:20:36] dense uh so for some subjects like
[00:20:38] studying mathematics uh coding things
[00:20:41] that are really procedurally heavy this
[00:20:43] type of flow may not work the best for
[00:20:45] you there's variations to this that uh
[00:20:48] might be more relevant but for any type
[00:20:50] of conceptual material uh medicine
[00:20:53] Anatomy uh you know basically all the
[00:20:56] stem subjects really uh history
[00:20:58] economics philosophy accounting these
[00:21:02] subjects are going to be ideal for this
[00:21:04] type of flow it involves a lot of
[00:21:06] scaffolding it involves active
[00:21:07] management of your cognitive load it
[00:21:09] involves elements that are made famous
[00:21:11] by things like pomodora or fodora which
[00:21:13] is the work rest timing and taking
[00:21:15] active relaxation we've got priming
[00:21:18] involved in it we've got nonlinear
[00:21:20] relational note taking so there are a
[00:21:22] lot of things in this that are going to
[00:21:24] be very very beneficial for your memory
[00:21:26] for your engagement you actually even
[00:21:28] enjoyment of studying the topic and
[00:21:30] ultimately it's going to save you time
[00:21:32] and make you a better learner so with
[00:21:34] the instructions out of the way you are
[00:21:35] now ready to go and do your actual
[00:21:37] studying check out the guided study with
[00:21:40] me video the link is in the description
[00:21:42] and happy
[00:21:48] studying


=== Studying alone VS Group studying ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTREiUZgapI

[00:00:00] uh what is more effective group studying
[00:00:01] or studying alone overall studying alone
[00:00:04] is going to be more effective there are
[00:00:06] really great group study methods that
[00:00:08] you can use the problem is that a lot of
[00:00:10] the time when people group study they
[00:00:11] just get distracted they just do random
[00:00:13] crap by themselves so it's not really
[00:00:15] like effective but if you do group study
[00:00:17] effectively it can be good but the the
[00:00:19] other thing is you can't just rely on
[00:00:21] group studying all the time so even if
[00:00:22] group study is more effective you still
[00:00:24] need to be better at studying alone
[00:00:26] because that's more sustainable and
[00:00:27] overall you're going to get better
[00:00:29] results from being better at studying
[00:00:31] alone because you're going to be
[00:00:32] spending more of your time studying
[00:00:33] alone like if you're dependent on the
[00:00:34] group study that's quite limiting right


=== Are Nootropics a Placebo? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFO2q8b4Bz4

[00:00:00] science-based Western medicine versus
[00:00:02] like Natural Therapy think about it more
[00:00:04] as a spectrum natural stuff in the
[00:00:07] beginning everything was natural stuff
[00:00:09] now we've got a mix of them but because
[00:00:11] science is constantly extracting the
[00:00:13] things that work from the natural stuff
[00:00:15] over time in the modern day the stuff
[00:00:18] that is considered more Natural Therapy
[00:00:20] naturopathic stuff they tend to be stuff
[00:00:22] that is more mild less consistent
[00:00:24] potentially more dangerous or in some
[00:00:26] cases legitimately it just does not work
[00:00:28] like it's just completely um Placebo but
[00:00:30] but I'm not saying that it doesn't work


=== How to be a more versatile learner ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3gShb3LEzk

[00:00:00] everyone should be a mixed mode learner
[00:00:02] but the specific mix of modes that you
[00:00:05] use for different subjects and different
[00:00:07] topics and in different parts of the
[00:00:09] learning process like when you're first
[00:00:11] encoding information for the first time
[00:00:13] versus when you're trying to practice
[00:00:14] rehearsal and retrieval these two
[00:00:17] situations might have different types of
[00:00:19] combinations and so there is a lot of
[00:00:20] personalization that can occur in
[00:00:22] understanding which combination is more
[00:00:24] effective for you how you make certain
[00:00:27] modalities work for you and then how you
[00:00:29] adjust adust that overall system
[00:00:31] depending on the needs and challenges
[00:00:33] that you have


=== Why you SHOULDN'T take education for granted ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vTavboVSek

[00:00:00] I just felt like I gave up on class and
[00:00:02] you just gave me a chance to make that
[00:00:05] time more useful because I will keep on
[00:00:07] going to class because these lectures
[00:00:08] have been paid for and I have a lot to
[00:00:11] give back to my family this is part of
[00:00:13] my respect towards that so yeah I'm just
[00:00:15] very thankful that now I have a way to
[00:00:17] go through it less painfully you know
[00:00:19] your motivation behind it and giving
[00:00:20] back to your family you know it's a
[00:00:22] beautiful thing to hear it's a very good
[00:00:24] like wholesome way of thinking about
[00:00:26] education in a way because a lot of
[00:00:28] people are very like entitled and it for
[00:00:30] granted but it's refreshing to actually
[00:00:32] hear someone talk about education in a
[00:00:34] way that it's like this is something
[00:00:35] that I can have and like this is a way
[00:00:37] of giving back and showing respect to
[00:00:38] the the people that have helped me get
[00:00:40] to the position that I'm in which is
[00:00:41] awesome


=== Are Nootropics just a scam? ===

[00:00:00] here something that you need to know
[00:00:01] about supplements natural therapies all
[00:00:03] of this sort of stuff I'm going to put
[00:00:04] out a few facts there right this stuff
[00:00:05] is like not debatable first of all I
[00:00:07] would say probably most of the natural
[00:00:11] things that we know are effective have
[00:00:14] been turned into medications like it
[00:00:16] went like this way back in the day there
[00:00:18] were all these you know plants and herbs
[00:00:19] and stuff that would just ground up mix
[00:00:21] with some pepper you know cook it over
[00:00:22] your fireplace and you drink that and
[00:00:24] you feel better we studied that right we
[00:00:26] we put our science hat on we looked at
[00:00:28] that we distilled it and then we turned
[00:00:31] it into a medication so like Western
[00:00:33] medication is essentially the distilled
[00:00:36] refined versions of the stuff that
[00:00:38] worked but it all started from you know
[00:00:41] like natural stuff


=== How effective is your pre-study? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geGZy7DxPMU

[00:00:00] you're doing some priming and the
[00:00:01] priming looks like it's doing good for
[00:00:03] you and actually probably the reason why
[00:00:04] you're able to still do pretty
[00:00:06] reasonably well even though essentially
[00:00:08] no study to speak of until just before
[00:00:10] the exam yeah it's probably because that
[00:00:11] priming is actually helping you a lot I
[00:00:13] would say and then in the lecture you uh
[00:00:15] asking good questions and that's going
[00:00:17] to be good it's going to help you to
[00:00:19] keep engaged and get a deeper level of
[00:00:20] Mastery obviously there's a big gap
[00:00:23] there in terms of what happens after the
[00:00:24] lecture and then before the exam
[00:00:26] although it is rushed I mean it's
[00:00:28] relatively targeted you're looking at
[00:00:30] objectives you're trying to identify
[00:00:31] gaps you're actively Gap seeking and
[00:00:33] you're trying to Target your revision
[00:00:34] for that I think the thing that's going
[00:00:36] to make the biggest difference is to
[00:00:37] figure out what can you do during the
[00:00:39] lecture that really takes what you did
[00:00:40] in your pre-study and Carries that
[00:00:41] forward to build on it a little bit more


=== Learning experts reacting to cross word revision. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWnrLiAFy78

[00:00:00] the best revision method for lazy
[00:00:01] students crosswords they're so
[00:00:03] underrated that they got me through GCS
[00:00:05] a levels and med school they're a CH for
[00:00:08] of rision that let you study entire
[00:00:09] courses in days here are some examples
[00:00:12] and you can download the rest the link
[00:00:13] in my bio you know what I don't know if
[00:00:17] I'm out of
[00:00:19] touch but I have never seen crossword
[00:00:23] studying like this this type of thing I
[00:00:26] I have a lot of opinions about the fact
[00:00:27] that it's still you know it's
[00:00:28] essentially just the same thing as Flash
[00:00:30] cards right and so there's the
[00:00:31] limitations with isolated information
[00:00:32] and recall and it's not really testing
[00:00:34] you on conceptual difficulty and
[00:00:35] networks integrated thoughts so you're
[00:00:36] not really going to get any of the
[00:00:38] benefits of deep processing really
[00:00:39] andless of course you're already a deep
[00:00:41] processor but if you get curveball
[00:00:42] questions or higher level questions
[00:00:44] you're kind of screwed if you're only
[00:00:45] rely on this technique and you don't
[00:00:46] have good de processing okay that's the
[00:00:48] Spiel done but this is just cool I like
[00:00:51] this just because it seems fun I want to
[00:00:53] do one this is cool I've never seen this
[00:00:55] before maybe I'm just maybe I'm out of
[00:00:56] touch now


=== Study tip for lectures ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln_ssph0SzY

[00:00:00] if you've got multiple lectures that are
[00:00:01] talking about essentially the same
[00:00:02] concept and the same topic do all of
[00:00:04] them at once if you can because you'll
[00:00:06] find more relationships between them
[00:00:08] than if you were to just do a single
[00:00:09] lecture sometimes there's something that
[00:00:10] you look at and you're like it takes you
[00:00:12] 15 minutes to just get your head around
[00:00:13] that but then actually three lectures
[00:00:15] later if you had known that information
[00:00:17] it would have made this so much easier
[00:00:18] to understand learning like broadly and
[00:00:22] superficially at the beginning is always
[00:00:23] better than going narrow and deep anyway
[00:00:25] the the tip here download the lecture if
[00:00:28] you can put it into an AI to transcribe
[00:00:31] it into words and then just read it it's
[00:00:33] faster than doing 1.5 or double spe


=== How to improve knowledge mastery before exams ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfO23or4eLg

[00:00:00] by the time the exam comes it's like I'm
[00:00:01] a deer in headlights I just oh wait I
[00:00:04] need to study and then I study there and
[00:00:06] then I go through the same cycle again
[00:00:08] when you say before exam like how long
[00:00:09] before the exam do you start two days
[00:00:12] geez man you you're not a deer in the
[00:00:13] headlight you're a deer that's like
[00:00:15] already sniffing the front of the the
[00:00:17] Bonnet you're mid impact exactly I think
[00:00:21] for you the thing that's actually
[00:00:22] limiting you is just literally the
[00:00:23] number of sessions you have to hit the
[00:00:25] different levels of Mastery M you're
[00:00:27] hitting a high level of Mastery
[00:00:29] superficial and
[00:00:30] but Broad and relational in your pre-
[00:00:32] study so that's good but then you're
[00:00:35] probably getting like a very extended
[00:00:36] per of knowledge Decay and your master
[00:00:39] is going to be fading before your exam
[00:00:41] and so all you need is maybe just like
[00:00:42] one or two additional sessions
[00:00:44] throughout the termal semester to be
[00:00:46] able to fit that in you know as you
[00:00:47] mentioned that's kind of more of a time
[00:00:48] management or a task management related
[00:00:50] issue


=== Learning coach reacts to study TikTok ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ew7NzxgIUw

[00:00:00] here is a revision technique that I use
[00:00:01] to get allo stars at gcsc and a level
[00:00:03] learning 2 years worth of content can
[00:00:05] almost feel impossible so it's really
[00:00:07] important that you have an infective
[00:00:08] technique to condense the course down I
[00:00:10] did this using summary Pages where I
[00:00:12] would make a single ail page for a topic
[00:00:14] like the alkanes and we for myself to
[00:00:16] find a way to break everything down so
[00:00:17] the whole course material fit onto that
[00:00:19] one page I have loads more revision
[00:00:21] techniques so we'll make more videos so
[00:00:22] follow that cool so I think the main
[00:00:26] thing with this is like as I've said you
[00:00:28] know summary summary pages work because
[00:00:30] it forces that prioritization evaluation
[00:00:32] of information if you use nonlinear
[00:00:34] methods of summarization you're going to
[00:00:36] find that it's more challenging but much
[00:00:38] more effective as well so you know
[00:00:39] that's the additional thing that I add
[00:00:40] to that


=== Finding knowledge gaps during revision ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOsXYczBSxw

[00:00:00] tell me about how you're doing your
[00:00:00] revision brain dump see what holes there
[00:00:03] are and then I specifically Target the
[00:00:05] holes that I end up seeing linear brain
[00:00:08] dump M my brain dump based on lecture
[00:00:10] objectives or just self queuing and just
[00:00:12] your own kind of flow I usually go
[00:00:16] through the lecture objectiv first and
[00:00:18] then after that I start making a mind
[00:00:21] map and then I might end up getting
[00:00:23] queued into remembering the stuff that I
[00:00:24] knew that I didn't remember that should
[00:00:27] happen like one week after the lecture
[00:00:28] so at the end of every week that's the
[00:00:30] session that you want to have before the
[00:00:32] exam your revision is more focused
[00:00:34] around just getting like a more Nuance
[00:00:36] level of Gap seeking the gaps that are
[00:00:38] not obvious like the gaps that are
[00:00:40] obvious that you can look at and be like
[00:00:42] I definitely know I've got these they
[00:00:44] should be already handled earlier on so
[00:00:46] that by the end you're looking for the
[00:00:47] gaps that you haven't discovered already


=== Watch Me Fix A Student's Learning System In 20 Minutes ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hp_sqBZqf-Q

[00:00:00] let's go into the after the lecture so
[00:00:01] what's happening afterwards nothing
[00:00:03] when's the first time that you'd
[00:00:04] actually go through and start like
[00:00:06] studying at again before the exam how
[00:00:08] long before the exam do you start 2 days
[00:00:11] so what's happening in the meantime in
[00:00:12] the meantime
[00:00:14] nothing I think for you the thing that's
[00:00:16] actually limiting you is just literally
[00:00:18] the number of sessions you have to hit
[00:00:19] the different levels of Mastery I have
[00:00:21] had the most productive week of my life
[00:00:24] this week your whole life wow very
[00:00:25] honestly every couple of months I find
[00:00:28] some members in our I can study program
[00:00:30] who are active and supportive in our
[00:00:32] community and I offer them some 30
[00:00:34] minute free coaching sessions some of
[00:00:36] you do seem to really like my coaching
[00:00:37] style content so I've decided to record
[00:00:39] some of these and post them on YouTube
[00:00:41] before we jump in I'd appreciate if you
[00:00:42] give this video a like and if you're
[00:00:44] interested in joining the full program
[00:00:45] yourself then you can check out iin
[00:00:47] study.com there's a link in the
[00:00:49] description the idea here is that in 30
[00:00:51] minutes I basically want to just help
[00:00:53] you as much as I can make some make some
[00:00:55] meaningful difference in that amount of
[00:00:57] time we'll see where we get but if you
[00:00:59] could just start start off by telling me
[00:01:00] a little bit about yourself you know
[00:01:02] like where you're from what you're what
[00:01:04] you're studying what stage of Education
[00:01:06] you're at things like that okay I am a
[00:01:08] first year college student my name is
[00:01:10] Daniel I come from Kenya I moved to
[00:01:13] Canada about 3 years ago when I was 15 I
[00:01:16] got a chance to go to a boarding school
[00:01:17] in an IB system I came from an igcc
[00:01:20] system and then I went into the Canadian
[00:01:22] Dogwood system for high school I
[00:01:24] recently started watching your videos
[00:01:26] and analyzing how I can change my
[00:01:28] learning methods 2 months ago and I
[00:01:30] realized that doing it by myself was
[00:01:31] much more inefficient and that the
[00:01:33] investment of just spending money to buy
[00:01:35] the course would be much better for the
[00:01:37] long-term my long-term goals and my
[00:01:39] long-term achievements that I wish to
[00:01:41] attain awesome that's great thanks for
[00:01:43] that so just tell me a little bit about
[00:01:44] your long-term goals my long-term goals
[00:01:47] as um as I go into college I want to go
[00:01:50] into Psychiatry so I have to go through
[00:01:52] medicine I want to go through Psychiatry
[00:01:54] to research particular dissociated
[00:01:56] disorders so I will need to spend a lot
[00:01:58] of time going and focusing on the
[00:01:59] psychology aspect as well as the
[00:02:01] medicine aspect on top of that I am a
[00:02:04] musician music is part of my soul the
[00:02:06] reason I have such an expensive
[00:02:07] microphone is because I love music
[00:02:10] there's a piano in my background right
[00:02:11] now that I can totally play and let's
[00:02:13] just say that that takes up a lot of
[00:02:15] time in my life I am very storm trop
[00:02:17] likee in what I like to do I have too
[00:02:19] many passions and not enough time for it
[00:02:21] so I have to be efficient because
[00:02:22] there's no other option aome well on
[00:02:24] that note let's just jump into that part
[00:02:26] so on the diagnostic assessment that it
[00:02:27] gave you a trooper what were your actual
[00:02:29] scores deep for deep processing and
[00:02:31] self-regulation deep processing was two
[00:02:33] self-regulation was two everything else
[00:02:35] was three just give me a indication
[00:02:37] about your overall background
[00:02:39] achievement level like what do you
[00:02:40] normally tend to get when you do tests
[00:02:42] and exams and things 80 plus okay let's
[00:02:44] jump into a little bit about your
[00:02:45] learning methods and your learning
[00:02:47] system is there a particular aspect that
[00:02:49] you feel like is holding you back that
[00:02:51] you have a problem with re revision and
[00:02:53] retrieval okay why do you say that I
[00:02:56] don't feel like my encoding elements are
[00:02:58] perfect but when it come if I'm left
[00:03:00] alone with a topic whichever topic it
[00:03:03] may be I am able to spark my engagement
[00:03:05] for the topic which I have over time
[00:03:06] learned how to do consistently I'm very
[00:03:08] confident in that initial exposure to
[00:03:11] that topic being very beneficial for me
[00:03:13] getting at least 75% of the topic in but
[00:03:16] when it comes to revision afterward when
[00:03:19] it comes to the retrieval and learning
[00:03:21] how to um get back to that and see what
[00:03:23] I've forgotten that's where I have a big
[00:03:25] problem just explain that a little bit
[00:03:27] more in terms of getting back to see are
[00:03:29] you talking about just finding knowledge
[00:03:31] gaps finding knowledge gaps okay so when
[00:03:34] you said you can get around what 75% of
[00:03:36] it are you saying that 25% is
[00:03:38] essentially knowledge gaps uh 15% is
[00:03:41] stuff that I know I don't know and 10%
[00:03:43] of that would be stuff I don't know that
[00:03:45] I don't know yeah sure and obviously
[00:03:47] there's multiple types of knowledge gaps
[00:03:48] like broadly speaking we can say that
[00:03:50] there are the gaps that you learned and
[00:03:51] then forgot and then there are gaps that
[00:03:53] you learned and then it's not that you
[00:03:55] forgot it but you never really saw it
[00:03:56] from that perspective and then there are
[00:03:58] things that you didn't even cover gaps
[00:04:00] that were like completely missed do you
[00:04:01] have any indication of the proportion of
[00:04:04] gaps that you feel like you have like
[00:04:06] how many let's start with the biggest
[00:04:07] one which is what percentage of gaps
[00:04:09] generally speaking and it might be
[00:04:11] different depending on subject do you
[00:04:13] feel are the types of gaps that you like
[00:04:15] completely missed in the first place
[00:04:17] like you didn't even study it to begin
[00:04:18] with very very few you I I do like going
[00:04:23] back and forth and in terms of my learn
[00:04:26] learning processes and as I go back
[00:04:28] sweeping back and forth I usually don't
[00:04:30] miss many things completely or at least
[00:04:32] I don't I always Mark out what I need to
[00:04:35] do in the first place okay and then so
[00:04:38] of the gaps that you find uh or or
[00:04:42] struggling to find how many of these are
[00:04:44] ones that you have learned and you
[00:04:46] learned it the right way but you have
[00:04:47] forgotten it um a very few no okay not
[00:04:52] very few but few okay so yeah okay so
[00:04:56] definit so generally speaking this is
[00:04:58] the lower one wait sorry is that because
[00:05:00] you didn't learn it the right way the
[00:05:02] first time round didn't learn it the
[00:05:03] right way the first time round okay so
[00:05:05] it's a master so the main gaps are
[00:05:07] really a Mastery Gap issue I see so
[00:05:09] rather than a pure retention Gap would
[00:05:11] you agree with that the main types of
[00:05:13] gaps you have are in discovering Mastery
[00:05:15] gaps yes okay but the ones that you do
[00:05:18] learn the right way to the right level
[00:05:20] of Mastery you feel that you've got a
[00:05:21] good level of retention on it yes I do
[00:05:24] okay cool we can look at this in two
[00:05:25] parts I know that You' have said that
[00:05:26] the revision and retrieval is a big one
[00:05:28] but I want to make sure that you're
[00:05:29] first round encoding is done you know
[00:05:32] like good enough that it's not going to
[00:05:33] have you know massive gaping holes in it
[00:05:35] because obviously even if we get the
[00:05:37] retrieval right if a lot of what you're
[00:05:39] missing is because you didn't learn the
[00:05:41] right way in the first place there's
[00:05:42] something to look at there and then we
[00:05:44] can have a look at the retrieval stuff
[00:05:45] so just tell me a little bit about the
[00:05:46] learning process for when you encounter
[00:05:48] information for the very first time I
[00:05:51] ask lots of questions about why this is
[00:05:53] relevant why I need to learn this and
[00:05:56] which parts of it are going to be the
[00:05:58] the most important parts that I need to
[00:06:00] learn so let's just rewind a little bit
[00:06:02] like when is this even happening like
[00:06:04] what's the first moment that the first
[00:06:07] piece of information for that topic like
[00:06:08] enters your scope before the lecture how
[00:06:12] far before usually the day before yeah
[00:06:15] usually the day before yes okay so you
[00:06:17] so day before is the first time you'll
[00:06:20] be exposed to that topic yes and so
[00:06:22] you're going to proactively just go
[00:06:24] through and do a little bit of pre-study
[00:06:25] or priming for that subject yes are you
[00:06:27] ever priming more than one lecture at a
[00:06:29] time um yes because the pace that I tend
[00:06:31] to Prime at is is faster than what I'm
[00:06:34] currently being taught at so how many
[00:06:36] like lectures roughly is one whole topic
[00:06:39] two three lectures okay and how many
[00:06:41] lectures are you able to Prime on two
[00:06:43] lectures two so you're doing almost the
[00:06:45] whole topic yes yes for priming okay
[00:06:48] you're doing a priming that is like
[00:06:49] almost whole topic and so tell me a
[00:06:51] little bit about what that priming
[00:06:52] process looks like what are you actually
[00:06:54] doing okay um learning objectives uh I
[00:06:57] go through the learning objectives I
[00:06:58] have my sheet of paper on the side I'll
[00:07:00] quickly scope through the um scan
[00:07:03] through the content I'll write down any
[00:07:05] keywords that I don't understand
[00:07:07] completely or a concept that I've noted
[00:07:09] it could be important and I do my best
[00:07:11] not to to think too much into the
[00:07:14] details of one specific keyword then
[00:07:16] once I'm once I'm at the end of the of
[00:07:19] the lecture notes or the slides that
[00:07:22] I've taken I'll take my keywords and
[00:07:24] then I'll try and make a mind map okay
[00:07:25] and how long does that whole process
[00:07:27] usually take 45 minutes this is very
[00:07:29] good by the way like everything you're
[00:07:31] saying is you know it's like a really
[00:07:32] really solid foundation of pre- study so
[00:07:34] if it's taking 45 minutes you know I I
[00:07:36] think overall by the end of that you're
[00:07:37] pretty confident with what that topic is
[00:07:39] going to talk about like the main ideas
[00:07:41] and like the overall flow yeah okay
[00:07:43] that's okay so now let's go into the
[00:07:46] actual you know day of like the the
[00:07:48] lecture itself are you going to the
[00:07:50] lectures or are you watching recording
[00:07:51] or how's that happening I'm going to the
[00:07:54] lectures the pace that the lectures go
[00:07:56] at is very not followable followable for
[00:08:00] me so I don't it's too slow and too fast
[00:08:04] at some points yeah sure there's times
[00:08:07] when I know that okay I need to sit here
[00:08:09] for a second and there's times that okay
[00:08:11] I really don't want to do this because I
[00:08:13] feel like I I should go to that more
[00:08:15] pressing issue how do you try to manage
[00:08:18] that I don't I basically study by myself
[00:08:22] outside of school and then when I'm
[00:08:24] getting into school into my lectures I'm
[00:08:26] taking down notes on what I know is
[00:08:28] going to come to the on the exam so when
[00:08:29] the teacher says this is going to come
[00:08:31] on the exam or this is one kind of model
[00:08:33] question that might come I'll take notes
[00:08:35] of that and then that's what I should be
[00:08:37] using for revision but then my
[00:08:39] self-regulation gets in the way and I
[00:08:40] don't use that for revision later on oh
[00:08:42] okay what's your note taking process
[00:08:45] during like while it's being explained
[00:08:48] to you physically I do not do anything
[00:08:50] because I have a very hard time focusing
[00:08:52] on on two tasks at once usually I'm I'm
[00:08:56] sitting there and I'm waiting to ask a
[00:08:58] really a good question or not waiting
[00:09:01] I'm trying to ask a really good question
[00:09:03] so why is um examples would be with
[00:09:05] hydrogen bonding in my recent chemistry
[00:09:07] lesson why a hydrogen bond and a dipole
[00:09:11] are different when they're technically
[00:09:13] the same thing but that's the details um
[00:09:15] move on from there yeah okay okay sure
[00:09:18] okay now let's go into the after the
[00:09:19] lecture so what's happening afterwards
[00:09:21] nothing okay so when when's the first
[00:09:25] time that You' actually go through and
[00:09:26] start like studying it again and
[00:09:28] consolidating before the exam okay so
[00:09:30] what's happening in the meantime in the
[00:09:32] meantime nothing and and why is that I
[00:09:34] started the course recently I started
[00:09:36] the course 4 days ago I think on the
[00:09:39] last Sunday actually yeah 7 days ago
[00:09:41] after realizing after the first getting
[00:09:44] into the Rapids about urgency and
[00:09:47] importance and the difference between
[00:09:48] those two things I've realized that I've
[00:09:50] been completely on urgency and and not
[00:09:52] really thinking about the importance so
[00:09:54] by the time the exam comes it's like I'm
[00:09:56] it's like I'm a deer in headlights I
[00:09:58] just oh wait I need to study and then I
[00:10:00] study that and then I go through the
[00:10:02] same cycle again when you say before
[00:10:04] exam like how how long before the exam
[00:10:06] do you start two days one day two days
[00:10:10] jeez man you you're not a deer in the
[00:10:11] headlight you're a deer that's like
[00:10:13] already sniffing the front of the the
[00:10:15] Bonnet you're mid impact exactly exactly
[00:10:19] okay so tell me about how you're doing
[00:10:20] your revision brain dump and see what
[00:10:22] holes there are and then I I
[00:10:24] specifically Target the holes that I
[00:10:27] that I end up seeing linear brain dump
[00:10:29] mind M brain dump so I have brain dump
[00:10:32] based on lecture objectives or just self
[00:10:35] queuing and just your own kind of flow I
[00:10:38] usually go through the lecture Aces
[00:10:40] first and then I see okay I'm very sure
[00:10:43] that I don't remember that I'm going to
[00:10:45] put that aside and uh I know I'm going
[00:10:46] to focus on that and then I put I sort
[00:10:48] out what I know for sure I do not
[00:10:50] remember and then after that I start
[00:10:52] making m a mind map and then I might end
[00:10:55] up getting queued into remembering the
[00:10:57] stuff that I knew that I didn't remember
[00:10:59] and then I'll start realizing okay I'm
[00:11:01] done I'm going to go check how accurate
[00:11:03] this is and I'm going to go check the
[00:11:04] parts that I wasn't confident in because
[00:11:06] even if I was right what matters is
[00:11:08] whether or not I was confident in it or
[00:11:10] not and then I'd go I'd repeat the cycle
[00:11:14] okay so here's what I'm seeing overall
[00:11:18] you're doing some priming and the
[00:11:19] priming looks like it's it's doing good
[00:11:21] for you and actually probably the reason
[00:11:23] why you're able to still do pretty like
[00:11:26] reasonably well even though you have
[00:11:29] essentially no study to speak of until
[00:11:31] just before the exam yeah um is probably
[00:11:33] because that priming is actually helping
[00:11:34] you a lot I would say and then in the
[00:11:36] lecture you are asking good questions
[00:11:39] and that's that's going to be good it's
[00:11:40] going to help you to keep engaged and
[00:11:42] get a deeper level of Mastery obviously
[00:11:44] there's a big gap there in terms of what
[00:11:46] happens after the lecture and then
[00:11:48] before the exam although it is rushed I
[00:11:50] mean it's relatively targeted you're
[00:11:52] looking at lecture objectives you're
[00:11:53] trying to identify gaps you're you're
[00:11:55] actively Gap seeking and you're trying
[00:11:56] to Target your revision for that so yeah
[00:11:59] yes like there's lots of things that can
[00:12:00] be improved with the retrieval system
[00:12:02] but I I think that's not really the
[00:12:03] lowest hanging fruit here for you I
[00:12:05] think the thing that's going to make the
[00:12:06] biggest difference is to figure out why
[00:12:08] is it that you know there's such a big
[00:12:10] gap between you know after the lecture
[00:12:12] and then your pre-exam revision and also
[00:12:16] um what can you do during the lecture
[00:12:18] that really takes what you did in your
[00:12:19] pre-study and Carries that forward to
[00:12:21] build on it a little bit more so let's
[00:12:23] just I'll start with that second one
[00:12:25] first have you ever tried to just take
[00:12:26] your pre-study mind map into the lecture
[00:12:28] with you and then just try to build on
[00:12:30] that as they're speaking no do you think
[00:12:33] that you would find that difficult to do
[00:12:34] uh I would but I can try yeah give it a
[00:12:37] go I don't think you'll find it as
[00:12:38] difficult as maybe you might think
[00:12:39] because you're already asking good
[00:12:41] questions and when you have the map in
[00:12:43] front of you it's going to help you to
[00:12:44] think of more questions because you can
[00:12:46] literally see it and when you add things
[00:12:48] to it it's going to help you to like
[00:12:49] organize the discoveries and insights
[00:12:51] you make and it also means that when
[00:12:54] some when you know when they say hey
[00:12:55] this is going to be in the exam this is
[00:12:56] going to be really important you can
[00:12:57] think about how that thing fits with
[00:13:00] what you've already got so that later
[00:13:01] when you do your revision it's actually
[00:13:03] anchored there on your map as well like
[00:13:05] you've already tried to integrate it on
[00:13:06] the spot right because the alternative
[00:13:09] is otherwise if it's too fast or too
[00:13:10] slow either way if it's hard to follow
[00:13:12] then that information is not really
[00:13:14] doing much for you anyway so spending a
[00:13:17] little bit more time inside your own
[00:13:18] head integrating thinking about how it
[00:13:20] all connects together that's going to be
[00:13:22] time that's worth spending all right so
[00:13:24] that's the first thing that I'd
[00:13:25] recommend for you to try out and the
[00:13:27] second thing that we should look at is
[00:13:28] you talked about the fact that you've
[00:13:30] really been like trapped in that urgency
[00:13:31] so now you know that you shouldn't do
[00:13:34] that do you think it's going to be easy
[00:13:36] for you to try to change that and have a
[00:13:38] little bit more of that regular
[00:13:39] consolidation like the day after at the
[00:13:41] end of the week or do you feel like it
[00:13:42] will still be difficult there'll be more
[00:13:44] barriers I I have had the most um the
[00:13:47] most productive week of my life this
[00:13:50] week your whole life wow very honestly
[00:13:52] yesterday I had a 12h hour or 13h hour
[00:13:57] workshift I woke up 5:00 a.m. today to
[00:14:00] get to my family's place on another
[00:14:03] Island to to be here for a family
[00:14:06] relations because this is very important
[00:14:09] and I still managed uh I kind of messed
[00:14:12] up my timing with the buses and needed
[00:14:14] to go to needed to walk 30 minutes back
[00:14:16] home to get all this gear so that you
[00:14:18] could have some proper good audio for
[00:14:21] for this video and in all with all of
[00:14:25] this happening I was able to have buffer
[00:14:27] time I had contingency plans I have
[00:14:30] contingency plans for what I'm going to
[00:14:31] do tomorrow and how I'm going to get to
[00:14:33] my job that I have to attend to and
[00:14:36] that's a that's amazing I think I think
[00:14:38] people that watch this video are going
[00:14:39] to want to have you back on to just ask
[00:14:41] you how you able to do that but anyway
[00:14:43] okay so so one week is one week really
[00:14:46] really productive is good do you feel
[00:14:48] that it's sustainable yes because it's
[00:14:51] not motivation based anymore right okay
[00:14:54] so hopefully that's something that will
[00:14:56] then just fix itself and that you will
[00:14:58] be able to have that day after the
[00:15:00] lecture you know the week after the
[00:15:02] lecture the thing is that when your
[00:15:03] knowledge Gap is because of let's say
[00:15:05] that the knowledge Gap is because you
[00:15:07] just completely miss something it's not
[00:15:08] even on the board these are relatively
[00:15:11] easy to fix because it just means that
[00:15:12] the scope that we're looking at is
[00:15:14] usually not align and there's some easy
[00:15:16] things that we can do like for example
[00:15:17] looking at the lecture objectives a
[00:15:18] little bit more clear clearly being more
[00:15:20] inquisitive exploring outside of the
[00:15:22] scope doing practice questions you know
[00:15:24] having conversations with people so
[00:15:26] that's kind of easy to solve if there's
[00:15:27] an issue with the retention
[00:15:29] again this is not as easy to solve but
[00:15:31] it's the answer is relatively
[00:15:32] straightforward usually the lowest
[00:15:34] hanging fruit is to work on having a
[00:15:37] better quality encoding and pre-study
[00:15:39] step which primes the brain to hold on
[00:15:41] to that information more in a more
[00:15:42] sticky way but in your situation your
[00:15:45] knowledge Gap is a Mastery issue Mastery
[00:15:47] issues there's really only two ways that
[00:15:49] we well there's fundamentally only one
[00:15:51] way that you can address a Mastery issue
[00:15:53] and that is to think at the level of
[00:15:55] Mastery more but because higher level
[00:15:58] lels of thinking are more integrated and
[00:16:00] relational there's many more angles to
[00:16:03] think through and it can be quite
[00:16:04] overwhelming and I think for you the
[00:16:06] thing that's actually limiting you is
[00:16:07] just literally the number of sessions
[00:16:09] you have to hit the different levels of
[00:16:10] Mastery M you're hitting a high level of
[00:16:13] Mastery like superficial and depth but
[00:16:16] Broad and relational in your pre-study
[00:16:18] so that's good you're heading some
[00:16:20] deeper level of depth and details and
[00:16:23] still somewhat relational in the lecture
[00:16:25] through the questions that you're asking
[00:16:27] and then by building on your mind map
[00:16:28] during the lecture that's going to help
[00:16:30] to to turn that into more of an asset
[00:16:32] that moves forward but then you're
[00:16:34] probably getting like a very extended
[00:16:36] per of knowledge Decay and your Mastery
[00:16:38] is going to be fading before your exam
[00:16:40] and so even though in your exam you're
[00:16:42] doing a relational brain dump which is
[00:16:44] targeting the higher levels and you're
[00:16:46] looking at Gap seeking which is going to
[00:16:47] look at multiple different levels
[00:16:49] there's just not going to be enough like
[00:16:51] sessions to be able to hit some of the
[00:16:53] finer details ideally what you should be
[00:16:55] doing is that whole revision thing that
[00:16:57] you do where you get the lecture
[00:16:58] objectives you target you do the brain
[00:17:00] dumps you you seek the gaps and then you
[00:17:02] try to fill those that should happen
[00:17:04] like one week after the lecture so at
[00:17:05] the end of every week that's the session
[00:17:07] that you want to have so that before the
[00:17:10] before the exam your revision is more
[00:17:12] focused around just getting like a a
[00:17:14] more Nuance level of of Gap seeking the
[00:17:17] gaps that are not obvious you don't want
[00:17:19] to you ideally don't want to know where
[00:17:22] your gaps are until you have tested them
[00:17:25] before the exam like the gaps that are
[00:17:27] obvious that you can look at and be like
[00:17:28] I definitely know I've got these they
[00:17:30] should be already handled earlier on so
[00:17:32] that by the end you're looking for the
[00:17:34] gaps that you haven't discovered already
[00:17:35] and all you need is maybe just like one
[00:17:37] or two additional sessions throughout
[00:17:38] the termal semester to be able to fit
[00:17:40] that in and that's I think you know as
[00:17:42] you mentioned that's kind of more of a
[00:17:43] time management or a task management
[00:17:44] related issue so those are probably the
[00:17:46] two things that I'd recommend for you to
[00:17:48] work on and in this case I think it was
[00:17:50] fairly obvious you probably could have
[00:17:51] figured that out yourself actually what
[00:17:53] do you think about those recommendations
[00:17:54] the one about bringing my I kind of gave
[00:17:56] up on my class honestly not that I hate
[00:17:59] the teachers I don't hate school
[00:18:01] whatsoever I think it's a wonderful um
[00:18:03] the one that I go to is wonderful even
[00:18:05] if the student culture around
[00:18:07] examination and learning isn't the best
[00:18:10] I just felt like I gave up on class and
[00:18:12] you just gave me a chance to you make
[00:18:15] that time more useful because I will be
[00:18:17] keep on going to class because these
[00:18:19] these these lectures have been paid for
[00:18:22] and I have I have a lot to give back to
[00:18:25] my family this is part of my respect
[00:18:27] towards that so I'm very I'm just very
[00:18:30] thankful that now I have a way to to go
[00:18:33] through it less painfully yeah you know
[00:18:35] one thing that I just thought of to add
[00:18:36] on is that because you're actually pre-
[00:18:38] studying in multiple lectures in one go
[00:18:41] if you can extend out your pre-study
[00:18:43] session by a little bit to try to cover
[00:18:44] the whole topic if it's if you're able
[00:18:46] to do like two lectures and there's only
[00:18:48] one more to go just just do another 15
[00:18:49] 20 minutes and just get that other one
[00:18:51] done but that means that when you're in
[00:18:53] the lecture you can go deeper as you
[00:18:55] build the map out but you can also use
[00:18:58] part of of that class like for example
[00:19:00] if they're talking about something and
[00:19:02] they're going over something for like a
[00:19:03] long time and you're just thinking like
[00:19:05] I don't even have any good questions to
[00:19:06] ask about this there's nothing to even
[00:19:08] build here use that time to just do some
[00:19:10] Gap seeking on the spot okay oh that's
[00:19:13] efficient I like that yeah it's one of
[00:19:15] those things it's like if you're going
[00:19:16] to be there anyway you may as well use
[00:19:20] that time for something and if it's not
[00:19:21] going to be useful for just you know CU
[00:19:24] you know a lot of the times like
[00:19:25] teachers or lecturers like you know if
[00:19:27] they might be tier they might just you
[00:19:30] know have whatever human yeah or
[00:19:32] sometimes they've just clocked out like
[00:19:34] literally you know sometimes you get you
[00:19:35] know teachers or lecturers that are like
[00:19:37] I'm kind of just waiting to retire yeah
[00:19:39] so you know in those situations you got
[00:19:41] to make do and and try to do what what
[00:19:43] you can but you know your motivation
[00:19:45] behind it and giving back to your family
[00:19:47] you know that's a it's a beautiful thing
[00:19:48] to hear and it's really you know it's a
[00:19:50] really it's a really good like wholesome
[00:19:52] way of thinking about education in a way
[00:19:55] because a lot of people are very like
[00:19:56] entitled you know it's refreshing to
[00:19:58] actually hear someone talk about
[00:20:00] education in a way that it's like I've
[00:20:02] paid for it this is something that I can
[00:20:03] have and like this is a way of giving
[00:20:05] back and showing respect to the the
[00:20:06] people that have helped me get to the
[00:20:07] position that I'm in which is
[00:20:09] [Music]
[00:20:14] awesome


=== Improve your note-taking during lectures ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i1nkd1SRf0

[00:00:00] what's your note taking process during
[00:00:03] like while it's being explained to you
[00:00:05] cuz you said that you have a basic map
[00:00:07] that you've created in your pre-study
[00:00:09] yes do you build on that during a
[00:00:11] lecture or do you kind of come back to
[00:00:13] that later I do not do anything because
[00:00:15] I have a very hard time focusing on two
[00:00:17] tasks at once usually I'm sitting there
[00:00:20] and I'm waiting to ask a really good
[00:00:22] question have you ever tried to just
[00:00:24] take your pre-study mind map into the
[00:00:26] lecture with you and then just try to
[00:00:27] build on that as they're speaking but I
[00:00:30] can try you're already asking good
[00:00:31] questions and when you have the map in
[00:00:33] front of you it's going to help you to
[00:00:35] think of more questions cuz you can
[00:00:36] literally see it and when you add things
[00:00:38] to it it's going to help you to like
[00:00:40] organize the discoveries and insights
[00:00:42] you make

[00:00:01] H so again immediately skip the call
[00:00:03] memorize anything using
[00:00:05] oversimplification thing again that I've
[00:00:06] got a problem with right my fingers
[00:00:08] crossed maybe it's good oh come on
[00:00:13] like
[00:00:17] [Music]
[00:00:20] like great I hate it


=== The RIGHT way to cram for exams ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR925zTJK_A

[00:00:00] I'm going to teach you the right method
[00:00:02] of cramming if you've got limited time
[00:00:04] without spending like 20 hours a day
[00:00:06] studying so for the first thing about
[00:00:08] cramming the right way is to understand
[00:00:09] that you're in a compromised position
[00:00:11] anyway if you can think like the
[00:00:13] examiner you increase your chance of
[00:00:15] studying the right thing most
[00:00:17] institutions will create exam questions
[00:00:19] based on some kind of framework and a
[00:00:22] common one will be like Bloom's revised
[00:00:23] taxonomy or solo taxonomy or really any
[00:00:26] variation but they follow the same
[00:00:29] general principles now the second thing
[00:00:30] is to know that most institutions in
[00:00:33] most countries are legally obligated to
[00:00:35] test you on the learning objectives now
[00:00:37] they don't have to test you on every
[00:00:39] single learning objective but they're
[00:00:41] still a useful guide to work off


=== You cannot try harder ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHg-R47EUbQ

[00:00:00] the third thing is that you can't try
[00:00:01] harder to think more deeply so a lot of
[00:00:03] you wrote critical thinking as a
[00:00:05] possible barrier you cannot try to think
[00:00:07] more critically just by trying to think
[00:00:09] more critically cuz when you sit there
[00:00:11] with the Page open and you're reading
[00:00:13] the words it doesn't change what you're
[00:00:14] actually doing in your brain just trying
[00:00:16] to be deeper doesn't change anything


=== You cannot tell yourself to remember facts. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq-nfgewG9M

[00:00:00] the second thing is that you cannot will
[00:00:01] yourself just to remember things so you
[00:00:03] can't take information and you can't say
[00:00:05] I'm going to remember this I'm going to
[00:00:07] try my hardest to remember it and you
[00:00:09] can't summon more effort to just try and
[00:00:12] remember something and then remember it
[00:00:14] better your memory does not care about
[00:00:16] how much you want to remember something
[00:00:18] so a lot of people will study and
[00:00:19] because they're struggling with
[00:00:20] remembering things their solution to
[00:00:22] that would be to try harder to remember
[00:00:24] it but that doesn't actually make any
[00:00:26] difference


=== What to prioritise when you're cramming ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-zzp83ahvs

[00:00:00] I'm going to teach you how you can study
[00:00:01] a huge amount in a very short period of
[00:00:04] time spend this time looking at the
[00:00:06] learning objectives looking at the
[00:00:08] different orders that they're going to
[00:00:09] test you on and if you've got some more
[00:00:11] time try to cram in using flash cards or
[00:00:14] Memory Palace techniques all the tiny
[00:00:16] little details that you might need to
[00:00:17] pick up and just get through as many of
[00:00:19] those details as possible if you can't
[00:00:21] get through them more no big deal you're
[00:00:24] already putting yourself in the best
[00:00:25] possible position anyway your chances of
[00:00:27] getting the right Mark are going to be
[00:00:30] relatively High because you can figure
[00:00:32] out a lot of things you can logically
[00:00:34] reason the right answers


=== Cramming lecture notes the RIGHT way ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJBtudfI15M

[00:00:00] you want to cover as many lectures as
[00:00:02] possible focusing only on the stuff that
[00:00:04] has the highest logic points after you
[00:00:06] do that go through the lectures and keep
[00:00:09] that filter in your mind ask yourself
[00:00:12] how connected is this information to
[00:00:14] everything else does it give me more
[00:00:15] logical reasoning and deduction ability
[00:00:18] and make a guess on how many logic
[00:00:20] points it has spend your time to learn
[00:00:22] the things that have the highest logic
[00:00:24] points only for as much of that paper as
[00:00:27] you can and to be honest if you can do
[00:00:29] that there is a really good chance that
[00:00:32] with that alone you could pass because
[00:00:35] especially if it's a multiple choice
[00:00:36] question you have increased a chance of
[00:00:38] guessing the right answer from maybe
[00:00:40] like a 25% random selection to a 45%


=== How to CRUSH any exam ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlkVXPSYPTM

[00:00:00] when I was in uni one of my friends
[00:00:02] skipped the hardest five lectures of
[00:00:05] biochemistry these five lectures would
[00:00:08] have taken like the same amount of time
[00:00:10] to study as all the other lectures
[00:00:12] combined for that topic and they managed
[00:00:14] to get an A minus without studying the
[00:00:17] hardest lectures at all they only
[00:00:21] focused on the simplest lectures and
[00:00:23] because they knew that as a percentage
[00:00:26] all of these lectures have to be tested
[00:00:28] at least once they just moed up a bunch
[00:00:30] of those easy points and they let
[00:00:32] themselves just figure out the rest with
[00:00:34] the hardest lectures to get like you
[00:00:35] know 20 or 30% of those questions right
[00:00:38] but the moral of the story here is that
[00:00:40] when you're clear about the learning
[00:00:41] objectives and you're clear about the
[00:00:43] different orders that they're likely to
[00:00:44] test you on it makes you have a much
[00:00:46] better judgment about what is relevant
[00:00:48] and what is not so it's time very
[00:00:50] worthwhile to spend


=== The best way to guess exam questions CORRECTLY ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km2l8JgrIFU

[00:00:00] so let's say you didn't study everything
[00:00:01] and the test question is now asking you
[00:00:03] about some piece of information that is
[00:00:06] missing from your network our brain has
[00:00:09] a network of knowledge it's able to use
[00:00:12] this network to make inferences about
[00:00:15] new information and new problems if
[00:00:18] you've got enough connections that are
[00:00:20] surrounding it you can logically infer
[00:00:24] the answer this is something that might
[00:00:25] be called deduction or logical reasoning
[00:00:28] and so obviously if you've got more more
[00:00:30] knowledge and more things surrounding
[00:00:32] the Gap then it's easier to make the
[00:00:34] inference


=== How to Finish 6 Months of Study in 72 Hours ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZMUg43t4Xw

[00:00:00] so you've got an exam coming up in 3
[00:00:02] days and you haven't started studying at
[00:00:04] all what can you do to get the best
[00:00:07] grade possible in this video I'm going
[00:00:09] to teach you how you can study a huge
[00:00:11] amount in a very short period of time to
[00:00:14] be clear I'm not encouraging you to cram
[00:00:17] for an entire exam in just 3 days but
[00:00:20] knowing how to cover a lot of volume in
[00:00:23] a short period of time is a useful skill
[00:00:25] if you're new to this Channel and you're
[00:00:26] wondering who I am I'm Dr Justin Sun I'm
[00:00:28] a learning coach in the head of learning
[00:00:29] I can study I'm also a former medical
[00:00:31] doctor and for the last decade I've
[00:00:33] helped thousands of people learn more
[00:00:35] efficiently which does sometimes include
[00:00:38] doing some hyper cramming before we jump
[00:00:40] in I'd appreciate if you give this video
[00:00:41] a like it really helps with the
[00:00:42] algorithm which my life is at the mercy
[00:00:45] of so why 3 days well there's a funny
[00:00:48] story actually back when I was in my
[00:00:50] third year of medical school there was
[00:00:52] this paper that I was studying for and I
[00:00:55] actually completely forgot that this
[00:00:56] paper even existed and I know what
[00:00:59] you're thinking thinking how can you
[00:01:01] forget that a paper even exists well at
[00:01:04] the time I was actually using a previous
[00:01:06] student notes as my primary source of
[00:01:09] studying I wasn't going to lectures
[00:01:10] anymore and this student just decided
[00:01:13] not to write any notes with this
[00:01:16] particular paper so I just didn't like I
[00:01:19] just forgot I just forgot that the whole
[00:01:21] paper existed until 3 days before the
[00:01:24] exam yes I understand it was really dumb
[00:01:27] I've been very dumb for a very long long
[00:01:30] part of my life and so for that 3 days
[00:01:32] before the exam I studied a lot like in
[00:01:35] 72 hours I probably studied 60 of those
[00:01:38] hours and I ended up getting the worst
[00:01:40] mark that I ever received in medical
[00:01:42] school which was a C+ which I think is
[00:01:44] like a 65% or something but the thing is
[00:01:47] I was actually quite lucky because that
[00:01:50] particular exam and that particular
[00:01:52] paper was very very fact recoil heavy so
[00:01:55] I could rely on a lot of just Plano root
[00:01:58] memorization and still managed to pass
[00:02:00] funnily enough that very paper the next
[00:02:03] year changed the way that they were
[00:02:05] examining so that you would no longer
[00:02:07] have been able to do that the questions
[00:02:09] got way more complicated way more Nuance
[00:02:11] like if you didn't properly understand
[00:02:12] it you wouldn't have done very well also
[00:02:14] potentially not surprising I don't
[00:02:16] remember anything about that paper
[00:02:18] anymore in fact I remember so little
[00:02:19] about that paper I don't even remember
[00:02:22] what the paper was on like I have a
[00:02:24] vague memory of remembering something to
[00:02:27] do with the pancreas and that's it maybe
[00:02:30] was the gallbladder anyway I've learned
[00:02:32] a lot more about how to study
[00:02:34] effectively since then and I'm going to
[00:02:36] teach you the right method of cramming
[00:02:38] if you've got limited time without
[00:02:40] spending like 20 hours a day studying so
[00:02:42] for the first thing about cramming the
[00:02:44] right way is to understand that you're
[00:02:46] in a compromised position anyway you got
[00:02:48] to lose something and you have to be
[00:02:50] strategic about what you're going to
[00:02:51] lose if you haven't started studying for
[00:02:53] something 3 days before your exam and
[00:02:55] you're expecting to still do really well
[00:02:57] you're either a genius or you're
[00:03:00] delusional I'm just going to let you
[00:03:02] decide which one you are and a big thing
[00:03:03] that helped me understand how to crme
[00:03:05] the right way was actually getting
[00:03:06] trained on creating assessment questions
[00:03:09] myself as an educator I've realized what
[00:03:11] goes on behind the scenes when they're
[00:03:14] creating an exam paper how they thinking
[00:03:16] about what the test you want because if
[00:03:18] you can think like the examiner you
[00:03:20] increase your chance of studying the
[00:03:22] right thing now most places most
[00:03:24] institutions will create exam questions
[00:03:27] based on some kind of framework and
[00:03:29] common one would be like Bloom's revised
[00:03:31] taxonomy or solo taxonomy or really any
[00:03:34] variation but they follow the same
[00:03:36] general principles there are usually
[00:03:38] different orders and levels of thinking
[00:03:40] and they're trying to assess you on
[00:03:42] those as a very general summary lower
[00:03:44] order methods of thinking and learning
[00:03:46] these tend to be a lot more isolated
[00:03:49] whereas the higher order levels tend to
[00:03:52] be much more integrated and there's
[00:03:55] something of a spectrum in between so
[00:03:56] it's the first piece of helpful
[00:03:58] information now the the second thing is
[00:04:00] to know that most institutions in most
[00:04:02] countries are legally obligated to test
[00:04:05] you on the learning objectives now they
[00:04:06] don't have to test you on every single
[00:04:09] learning objective and what Falls within
[00:04:11] the scope of a learning objective can be
[00:04:14] quite a gray area sometimes but they're
[00:04:17] still a useful guide to work off and
[00:04:19] most examiners are going to think like
[00:04:21] this there's a list of learning
[00:04:23] objectives that they have for that
[00:04:24] particular subject let's say that there
[00:04:26] are three for one lecture and they're
[00:04:28] going to be thinking how can they test
[00:04:30] these learning objectives at these
[00:04:32] different levels of learning so already
[00:04:35] this helps to narrow down our focus a
[00:04:37] little bit for example if we have a
[00:04:40] topic around Greek history then we might
[00:04:43] get asked a question at a lower order
[00:04:45] that's like described the major events
[00:04:47] and significance of the Greco Persian
[00:04:50] Wars who were the key leaders and what
[00:04:53] were the key battles and outcomes of
[00:04:54] this conflict whereas for the same
[00:04:56] subject a mid order question might be
[00:04:59] something like like analyze the social
[00:05:01] and political structure of Athens during
[00:05:03] the time of Pericles how did pericles's
[00:05:06] leadership impact the Athenian democracy
[00:05:08] culture and Empire Building efforts you
[00:05:10] can see that it sign they compare and
[00:05:12] contrast multiple ideas against each
[00:05:14] other compared to the really higher
[00:05:16] order questions which might sound a
[00:05:18] little bit more like evaluate the
[00:05:20] influence of Greek philosophy on the
[00:05:22] development of West and thought
[00:05:24] discussed the contributions of Socrates
[00:05:26] Plato and Aristotle and how their ideas
[00:05:28] shaped not only ancient grease but also
[00:05:30] subsequent intellectual philosophical
[00:05:31] traditions so now it's not just about
[00:05:33] examining different ideas against each
[00:05:35] other but now you have to create a value
[00:05:38] judgment about how important the
[00:05:40] contribution of each of these ideas and
[00:05:43] relationships are on each other it's
[00:05:44] more than just knowing that there are
[00:05:46] differences and similarities it's
[00:05:48] understanding the significance of them
[00:05:49] if we use another example like
[00:05:51] microbiology then we could have a lower
[00:05:53] order equ that sounds like explain the
[00:05:56] differences between procaryotic and
[00:05:58] eukariotic cells with examples of
[00:06:00] microorganisms that belong to each
[00:06:01] category and describe their basic
[00:06:03] structural characteristics relatively
[00:06:05] straightforward fact recall quite
[00:06:07] isolated a mid-order question instead
[00:06:09] might sound a little bit more like
[00:06:11] discuss the role of microorganisms and
[00:06:13] biogeochemical cycles focusing on the
[00:06:15] nitrogen and carbon Cycles how do
[00:06:17] bacteria and AA contribute to nutrient
[00:06:19] cycling in ecosystems and what are the
[00:06:21] ecological implications of these
[00:06:23] processes again you can see now we're
[00:06:25] looking at comparing different concepts
[00:06:28] and ideas with each other but we don't
[00:06:30] have the idea of significance that comes
[00:06:33] through the higher order version which
[00:06:34] might sound like critically evaluate the
[00:06:37] use of antibiotics in medicine and
[00:06:38] agriculture analyze the challenges of
[00:06:40] antibiotic resistance its mechanisms and
[00:06:42] the potential consequences for public
[00:06:45] health and propose strategies to address
[00:06:47] the issue of antibiotic resistance
[00:06:48] effectively that's a super broad
[00:06:51] question incredibly complicated but
[00:06:53] again you see that they're asking you
[00:06:55] about the consequence the significance
[00:06:57] the importance of these interaction
[00:06:59] actions so this is going to be the
[00:07:00] pattern across the board any lecture
[00:07:03] objective they can test you on a direct
[00:07:05] immediate fact recall very isolated they
[00:07:08] can ask you about comparisons with
[00:07:10] related other Concepts or objectives or
[00:07:13] they can ask you about the significance
[00:07:15] of them again they don't necessarily
[00:07:16] have to ask each of these depending on
[00:07:18] your curriculum sometimes the lecture
[00:07:20] objectives are actually written in a way
[00:07:22] that indicates what level they're
[00:07:24] interested in so for example the lecture
[00:07:25] objective might actually say that what
[00:07:27] they want from you is to be able to
[00:07:30] describe the something something
[00:07:31] something which suggest that it's a
[00:07:33] lower water Mastery they're looking for
[00:07:36] whereas if the lecture objective uses
[00:07:37] words like discuss evaluate contrast
[00:07:41] these are indications that they want
[00:07:42] that higher order flare and so when you
[00:07:44] scan through electure objectives you can
[00:07:46] actually get a reasonably good map for
[00:07:49] how they're likely to test you now
[00:07:52] remember you're going to lose something
[00:07:54] you're not going to be able to cover
[00:07:55] every single question there are going to
[00:07:57] be things that you miss but this is is a
[00:07:59] more strategic way of using your time it
[00:08:02] increases the probability of getting
[00:08:04] more questions correct but this is still
[00:08:06] not enough because even then especially
[00:08:09] if you've got a Content dense curriculum
[00:08:11] it's going to be very overwhelming and
[00:08:13] this is where the idea of logic comes in
[00:08:16] how can we help our brain figure out
[00:08:19] what the right answer is even when it
[00:08:22] doesn't actually know the right answer I
[00:08:25] mean it's kind of a fancy way of just
[00:08:26] saying how can we guess more accurately
[00:08:28] and so if we look at how our brain is
[00:08:31] able to make logical deductions it can
[00:08:33] be even more strategic how we spend our
[00:08:36] time cramming let me explain our brain
[00:08:39] has a network of knowledge it's able to
[00:08:42] use this network to make inferences
[00:08:45] about new information and new problems
[00:08:48] so let's say you didn't study everything
[00:08:50] and the test question is now asking you
[00:08:52] about some piece of information that is
[00:08:54] missing from your network well if you've
[00:08:57] got enough connections that are
[00:08:58] surrounding in it you can logically
[00:09:01] infer the answer this is something that
[00:09:04] might be called deduction or logical
[00:09:06] reasoning and so obviously if you've got
[00:09:08] more knowledge and more things
[00:09:10] surrounding the Gap then it's easier to
[00:09:13] make the inference for example if the
[00:09:15] only thing that you're missing is the
[00:09:17] second step of a process but you know
[00:09:20] the first step and the third step and
[00:09:22] you know what goes in and you know what
[00:09:23] comes out you might logically be able to
[00:09:25] figure out what happens in the middle to
[00:09:27] make it from input and output and here's
[00:09:29] a really strategic part when it comes to
[00:09:31] cramming is that not all information is
[00:09:35] the same value from a logical reasoning
[00:09:38] perspective we can always think about
[00:09:40] each piece of information having like
[00:09:42] logic points the more logic points
[00:09:45] something has the more useful it is in
[00:09:48] figuring out other things typically
[00:09:50] these are going to be the major Concepts
[00:09:52] principles rationals on the other hand
[00:09:55] if you have something that is low level
[00:09:58] of logic points then this is going to be
[00:10:00] like a very very detailed technical
[00:10:02] piece of information like for example a
[00:10:05] particular constant for an equation or
[00:10:07] the particular micrometers or the tubule
[00:10:11] this is information which might come up
[00:10:14] somewhere but there's limited ways that
[00:10:16] you can use this information to
[00:10:18] logically deduce other knowledge gaps
[00:10:20] and so this gives us the basis for our
[00:10:22] hyper cramming strategy we want to use
[00:10:25] our time to figure out what are the
[00:10:26] learning objectives what are the and
[00:10:29] levels of learning that they're likely
[00:10:31] to assess us on for each of these
[00:10:33] objectives and then what are the pieces
[00:10:35] of information that give us the most
[00:10:38] logical deduction power I.E which pieces
[00:10:42] of information have the highest logic
[00:10:43] points now you might be wondering how do
[00:10:46] you even know what the logic points of
[00:10:48] something are and the answer is that
[00:10:50] until you really spend more time to
[00:10:52] study which you don't have time to do by
[00:10:54] the way you're not really going to know
[00:10:56] so you have to make your best guess the
[00:10:58] good good news is that your best guess
[00:11:00] is probably going to be reasonably
[00:11:03] accurate all you have to do is as you're
[00:11:05] reading the lecture slides or the
[00:11:07] coursebook or whatever resources you're
[00:11:08] studying from you ask yourself how
[00:11:12] valuable is this piece of information at
[00:11:15] helping me explain other things in the
[00:11:18] topic how helpful is it at making sense
[00:11:22] of multiple other things in the topic
[00:11:24] and you will generally be able to say
[00:11:26] okay well this seems like it might Maybe
[00:11:29] be related to some other things or you
[00:11:32] might read it and think this seems
[00:11:34] really specific and it's probably not
[00:11:36] going to be very relevant and so what
[00:11:38] you do is you just ignore the things
[00:11:40] that seem like they're not going to be
[00:11:42] as relevant and you just start with the
[00:11:45] things that feel like they are connected
[00:11:47] to more pieces and it doesn't really
[00:11:49] matter if you miss a few things because
[00:11:51] first of all again you've got limited
[00:11:53] time you got to pick your losses but the
[00:11:55] other thing is that you might get three
[00:11:57] pages down and realize something you
[00:12:00] skipped earlier actually is really
[00:12:03] related like it directly explains this
[00:12:05] other thing that you're now reading
[00:12:06] about well that's fine you can just
[00:12:08] always go back and then learn it now but
[00:12:10] the key is to be quite aggressive with
[00:12:12] filtering what information is helping
[00:12:14] you reason about the topic and which
[00:12:17] information is something that you might
[00:12:19] just end up having to wrot learn and
[00:12:20] memorize which you've got limited time
[00:12:22] for and that's the type of thing that
[00:12:23] you should really have for the last
[00:12:25] night of cramming rather than day one of
[00:12:29] a 3-day cramming stretch so here is how
[00:12:31] I would schedule it if you've only got 3
[00:12:33] days day one spend about one or 2 hours
[00:12:36] of that time which I know it seems like
[00:12:38] a lot of time but it's well worth it
[00:12:41] scoping through the topic to pick out
[00:12:43] what are the learning objectives and
[00:12:45] what are the orders of learning that
[00:12:47] they're probably going to test me on
[00:12:49] this is going to give you a bit of
[00:12:51] filter for when you're reading the
[00:12:52] information so you can make sense of how
[00:12:54] important it is and how much time it's
[00:12:56] worth investing into it in the first
[00:12:57] place you might sometimes find entire
[00:13:00] lectures where every single learning
[00:13:02] objective is very very lower order and
[00:13:06] memorization heavy this is the type of
[00:13:08] lecture that you might want to just
[00:13:10] completely skip on this first day and
[00:13:12] come back to later it's kind of like a
[00:13:15] nice to have on the other hand you might
[00:13:17] realize that only two or three lectures
[00:13:20] are really really dense and asking you
[00:13:22] about the higher water things and you've
[00:13:24] got like another 10 or 20 lectures that
[00:13:26] are all much simpler much faster and the
[00:13:29] learning objectives for it seem much
[00:13:32] simpler in lower order in that case the
[00:13:34] right strategy might be to put the
[00:13:36] higher water of stuff off first and just
[00:13:39] go through the simple lectures because
[00:13:41] most places you will have to be tested
[00:13:43] on every lecture at least once in fact I
[00:13:46] remember when I was in unique one of my
[00:13:48] friends skipped the hardest five
[00:13:51] lectures of Bio chemistry like these
[00:13:54] five lectures would have taken like the
[00:13:56] same amount of time to study as all the
[00:13:59] other lectures combined for that topic
[00:14:01] and they managed to get an A minus
[00:14:03] without studying the hardest lectures at
[00:14:06] all they only focused on the simplest
[00:14:09] lectures and because they knew that as a
[00:14:12] percentage all of these lectures have to
[00:14:14] be tested at least once they just moed
[00:14:17] up a bunch of those easy points and they
[00:14:19] let themselves just figure out the rest
[00:14:21] with the hardest lectures to get like
[00:14:22] you know 20 or 30% of those questions
[00:14:24] right but the moral of the story here is
[00:14:26] that when you're clear about the
[00:14:28] learning objectives and you're clear
[00:14:30] about the different orders that they're
[00:14:31] likely to test you on it makes you have
[00:14:33] a much better judgment about what is
[00:14:35] relevant and what is not so it's time
[00:14:36] very worthwhile to spend after you do
[00:14:38] that go through the lectures and keep
[00:14:41] that filter in your mind ask yourself
[00:14:44] how connected as this information to
[00:14:46] everything else does it give me more
[00:14:47] logical reasoning and deduction ability
[00:14:50] and make a guess on how many logic
[00:14:52] points it has spend your time to learn
[00:14:54] the things that have the highest logic
[00:14:55] points only for as much of that paper as
[00:14:58] you can you want to cover as many
[00:15:01] lectures as possible focusing only on
[00:15:03] the stuff that has the highest logic
[00:15:05] points and to be honest if you can do
[00:15:07] that there is a really good chance that
[00:15:10] with that alone you could pass because
[00:15:13] especially if it's a multiple choice
[00:15:14] question youve increased the chance of
[00:15:16] guessing the right answer from maybe
[00:15:18] like a 25% random selection to a 45% but
[00:15:23] we still have day two and so on day two
[00:15:25] we're going to do the exact same thing
[00:15:27] as day one but now on the slightly lower
[00:15:30] level of logic points these are the
[00:15:33] things that you skipped on the first day
[00:15:35] still not those really really detailed
[00:15:37] things but the parts that feel like they
[00:15:39] are maybe a little bit more important
[00:15:42] but definitely not as important as the
[00:15:44] stuff that you covered on day one and
[00:15:45] again go through as many lectures as
[00:15:47] possible filling that out and again I
[00:15:49] know it's scary to keep just skipping
[00:15:51] all of this content but You' got to lose
[00:15:54] something and again you have to pick
[00:15:55] your losses and so for day three we're
[00:15:58] going to spend this time looking at the
[00:16:00] learning objectives looking at the
[00:16:01] different orders that they're going to
[00:16:02] test you on and asking yourself are
[00:16:04] there any really obvious gaps that I
[00:16:07] haven't been able to fill yet and if
[00:16:08] you've got some more time try to cram in
[00:16:11] using flash cards or Memory Palace
[00:16:13] techniques all the tiny little details
[00:16:15] that you might need to pick up and just
[00:16:17] get through as many of those details as
[00:16:19] possible if you can't get through them
[00:16:20] more no big deal you're already putting
[00:16:23] yourself in the best possible position
[00:16:24] anyway and what you'll find is that when
[00:16:26] you walk into the exam you're not really
[00:16:28] going to be that confident for any
[00:16:30] question but overall your chances of
[00:16:32] getting the right Mark are going to be
[00:16:35] relatively High because you can figure
[00:16:37] out a lot of things you can logically
[00:16:39] reason the right answers if you like
[00:16:41] this approach you thought it was
[00:16:42] interesting and you want to learn more
[00:16:43] methods like this then this as well as
[00:16:46] basically everything else I talk about
[00:16:48] in all my videos are covered in my
[00:16:50] guided learning program this is a
[00:16:52] stepbystep guided training program that
[00:16:55] distills a decade of my experience
[00:16:58] teaching people to learn more
[00:16:59] efficiently so that you can have the
[00:17:01] smoothest and easiest and most
[00:17:03] error-free path of becoming more
[00:17:05] efficient learner if that sounds
[00:17:07] appealing to you then you can check that
[00:17:08] out at ion study.com there's a link in
[00:17:10] the description now this method of
[00:17:11] criming is actually really beneficial
[00:17:13] for some other reasons as well first of
[00:17:15] all it really helps to figure out that
[00:17:18] logic Point scoring because it trains
[00:17:20] your brain to be more Discerning with
[00:17:22] the information this is a really
[00:17:24] important part of deep processing which
[00:17:27] is in other words how intelligent you
[00:17:30] are and that's something that you can
[00:17:31] train I talk about that a lot more in my
[00:17:33] video around learner types and the other
[00:17:35] thing is that if you have more days like
[00:17:37] 4 days or 5 days or 6 days or seven days
[00:17:39] or maybe even like you know like a whole
[00:17:41] semester to study for it you can
[00:17:42] actually use the exact same approach but
[00:17:45] you just spend longer on each of the
[00:17:47] days but the phases and what you're
[00:17:49] focusing on in each phase of study
[00:17:52] Remains the Same in the first phase
[00:17:54] whether that's one day or seven days
[00:17:57] we're focusing on the higher logic Point
[00:17:59] items and then on the second phase we're
[00:18:01] focusing on the mid logic Point items
[00:18:04] and in the third phase AKA maybe the few
[00:18:07] weeks before the exam or few days we're
[00:18:09] going to be going through lecture
[00:18:11] objectives looking at the different
[00:18:12] orders that we might be tested on
[00:18:14] looking for gaps and then mopping up all
[00:18:16] those little details that we'd have to
[00:18:18] rot memorize that we're only going to
[00:18:19] remember for a few days anyway and so
[00:18:21] that is the most cognitively beneficial
[00:18:23] way of cramming again I'm not saying you
[00:18:24] should cram but if you're going to do it
[00:18:25] you may as well do it the right way


=== Exam in 3 days? Do THIS ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT5o9_bWrdw

[00:00:00] so you've got an exam coming up in 3
[00:00:02] days and you haven't started studying at
[00:00:04] all what can you do to get the best
[00:00:07] grade possible all you have to do is as
[00:00:09] you're reading the lecture slides or the
[00:00:11] course book or whatever resources you're
[00:00:13] studying from you ask yourself how
[00:00:16] valuable is this piece of information at
[00:00:20] helping me explain other things in the
[00:00:23] topic what you do is you just ignore the
[00:00:25] things that seem like they're not going
[00:00:27] to be as relevant and you just start
[00:00:30] with the things that feel like they are
[00:00:32] connected to more pieces


=== How to use flash cards ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGpOzm8JCRo

[00:00:00] we know that flash cards are an
[00:00:01] excellent tool for its purpose you can
[00:00:03] root memorize lower order facts and
[00:00:07] details especially in the short term but
[00:00:09] beyond that relational thinking
[00:00:11] conceptual thinking complex problem
[00:00:12] solving deeper application or having bit
[00:00:14] a long-term memory we know that this is
[00:00:16] not a good tool but lots of students
[00:00:19] over rely on this and actually in some
[00:00:20] cases that's the only technique that
[00:00:22] they have in their Arsenal and this
[00:00:24] means that we can easily become
[00:00:25] overwhelmed because the brain's ability
[00:00:27] to just prune out necessary relevant
[00:00:31] information which is what the brain
[00:00:32] thinks about stuff that you're just
[00:00:34] repeatedly cramming in through flash
[00:00:35] cards your brain's ability to do that is
[00:00:38] much much more efficient and faster than
[00:00:42] your ability to just do and repeat more
[00:00:45] of the same flash cards you're never
[00:00:46] going to win against your brain


=== The 3 stages of effective cramming ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBjxmvpGooA

[00:00:00] I'm not saying you should cram but if
[00:00:01] you're going to do it you may as well do
[00:00:02] it the right way in the first phase
[00:00:04] we're focusing on the higher logic Point
[00:00:07] items and then on the second phase we're
[00:00:09] focusing on the mid logic Point items
[00:00:11] and in the third phase we're going to be
[00:00:13] going through lecture objectives looking
[00:00:15] at the different orders that we might be
[00:00:17] tested on looking for gaps and then
[00:00:19] mopping up all those little details that
[00:00:21] we'd have to rot memorize that we're
[00:00:22] only going to remember for a few days
[00:00:24] anyway and so that is the most
[00:00:25] cognitively beneficial way of cramming


=== Is hard work important? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rofpAOMiuUc

[00:00:00] hard work is important but it's more of
[00:00:02] a prerequisite see for something like
[00:00:04] studying and learning spending more time
[00:00:06] and effort on using methods that aren't
[00:00:08] Well Suited and optimized can actually
[00:00:11] make things worse the classic example
[00:00:13] that I often give is flash card over
[00:00:15] Reliance we know that flash cards are an
[00:00:17] excellent tool for its purpose lowlevel
[00:00:20] memorization of material that doesn't
[00:00:22] fit within a network it's good for that
[00:00:24] lower order learning on very specific
[00:00:27] details however a lot of people are
[00:00:29] using that to learn everything and then
[00:00:31] they're going to struggle with more
[00:00:32] complex problem solving and application
[00:00:34] they're going to wonder why their
[00:00:35] knowledge and their retention is so low
[00:00:38] uh they're constantly fighting against
[00:00:39] their memory because of the fact that
[00:00:41] they're operating and they're learning
[00:00:43] using a method that is never really
[00:00:45] designed to enhance their memory in the
[00:00:47] first place


=== Her story broke my heart because it's so common ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiJrrQAYtLw

[00:00:00] Sarah bright bubbly pink shirt Sarah
[00:00:02] just starts crying and I was taken back
[00:00:04] that that had never happened to me
[00:00:05] before I'd done so many consultations
[00:00:06] and that never happened and I was like
[00:00:07] oh my god did I do something wrong like
[00:00:09] did I did I say something that I
[00:00:10] shouldn't have and then Sarah just looks
[00:00:12] at me and she says I thought I was just
[00:00:15] dumb so so Sarah had internalized this
[00:00:18] idea that the reason she struggled was
[00:00:20] not because there was something wrong
[00:00:21] with her methods cuz she was just doing
[00:00:22] the same thing that all of her friends
[00:00:23] were doing it was just what you do but
[00:00:24] she just decided that because I'm doing
[00:00:26] what my friends are doing and I'm not
[00:00:27] getting these great amazing results that
[00:00:29] all my friends are getting I must just
[00:00:30] be an idiot the only time learning
[00:00:32] becomes really difficult and challenging
[00:00:34] and it's a struggle and we find like
[00:00:36] we're combating our our memory and we're
[00:00:38] not able to apply the knowledge properly
[00:00:40] is when we didn't do the learning right
[00:00:42] at the time


=== No one cares about high school ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqg2IbiebOc

[00:00:00] is an immediate red flag for any
[00:00:02] applicate is if they really overstate or
[00:00:04] in some cases even mention their High
[00:00:06] School Achievements because the view is
[00:00:08] like this high school is like so
[00:00:11] irrelevant in most cases to an actual
[00:00:13] job if what you're so proud of is that
[00:00:15] you did well in high school it just
[00:00:17] means that you kind of like didn't
[00:00:18] really do much with your life after that


=== Are you making yourself irreplaceable? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6VPkMe7eL0

[00:00:00] it's no longer enough just to know
[00:00:01] things and it's no longer enough just to
[00:00:02] have technical skills because anyone can
[00:00:04] reproduce that like look at design for
[00:00:05] example if you have generative design
[00:00:07] basically all of that technical skills
[00:00:08] kind of useless so the thing that
[00:00:10] distinguishes someone is actually now
[00:00:12] your ability to understand the context
[00:00:14] understand the big picture of things
[00:00:15] understand how things fit in not just in
[00:00:17] the scope of what you're doing and like
[00:00:19] a task level but more strategically it's
[00:00:22] being able to actually generate
[00:00:23] knowledge that is useful Beyond just
[00:00:25] what you learn into something that's
[00:00:26] original


=== Don't make this mistake when learning a new skill ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DMatfOPhaY

[00:00:00] I see this a lot when it comes to people
[00:00:01] trying to improve the way that they
[00:00:03] learn or study is that they're looking
[00:00:05] for something that just immediately
[00:00:06] helps them to improve not realizing all
[00:00:09] the different things that are involved
[00:00:11] in learning to be an efficient learner
[00:00:14] for example we'll have people joining
[00:00:15] our program and they'll learn a new
[00:00:17] technique and they'll practice it and
[00:00:19] try it for like 5 to 10 minutes and if
[00:00:22] it's not giving them that immediate
[00:00:24] result in just 10 minutes they say okay
[00:00:26] this is not working for me they move on
[00:00:27] to the next technique never really
[00:00:29] giving themselves a chance to build the
[00:00:31] skill in fact there are even some
[00:00:33] students that will have done this kind
[00:00:35] of just flittering around different
[00:00:37] techniques for months before realizing
[00:00:40] that the thing that actually holds them
[00:00:41] back the most is not realizing that the
[00:00:44] first part of making any progress is
[00:00:47] just removing the barriers that stop you
[00:00:50] from making progress in the first place
[00:00:52] which in this example is the mindset
[00:00:54] perspective and method of practicing new
[00:00:57] skills


=== Why great students terrible doctors ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTSXAxfbyGs

[00:00:00] I went through medical school getting
[00:00:01] like a AE average my first clinical
[00:00:04] attachment general medicine I failed I
[00:00:06] failed because I had been learning for
[00:00:08] the examination I understood each
[00:00:10] Concept in itself in isolation I just
[00:00:12] did not see how to put it together and
[00:00:14] bring it together then I made up for it
[00:00:15] with three back toback distinctions
[00:00:16] after that all right but good idea

[00:00:00] before I left clinical medicine one of
[00:00:02] the barriers for me in actually taking
[00:00:04] that step was that if I quit my job I
[00:00:07] would not have any money cuz at the time
[00:00:09] I wasn't even paying myself for working
[00:00:12] in my education business so I realized
[00:00:14] that I actually have to start paying
[00:00:16] myself a salary so I can make that
[00:00:18] transition so the barrier that I found
[00:00:21] was the lack of Financial Freedom so for
[00:00:24] me I spent a few months just learning
[00:00:26] and reading more talking to people about
[00:00:28] the idea of commercial ization and how
[00:00:31] you can use money for impact while also
[00:00:33] paying yourself and so around 6 months
[00:00:36] later I was able to pay myself out a
[00:00:39] small salary and now that that barrier
[00:00:41] had been removed I was open to many more
[00:00:43] opportunities that I could explore these
[00:00:45] are all barriers that we might just
[00:00:47] discover which we don't necessarily know
[00:00:50] enough to plan for in advance and this
[00:00:52] is normal in fact this is expected so we
[00:00:55] should expect it


=== Understanding is not learning ===

[00:00:00] how many of you heard the saying
[00:00:01] memorizing is not real learning
[00:00:02] understanding is real learning have any
[00:00:04] of you heard that saying before yeah
[00:00:05] it's just not true just because you
[00:00:07] understand something doesn't mean you've
[00:00:08] actually learned it in order for you to
[00:00:09] learn it it needs to stay in your in
[00:00:12] your memory and then you need to be able
[00:00:13] to use the memory that's like the
[00:00:14] functional part of learning


=== Why learning is like solving a puzzle ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEGRlD_aw6w

[00:00:00] I often talk about learning like solving
[00:00:02] a jigsaw puzzle making an analogy for
[00:00:04] learning is actually like taking a new
[00:00:07] piece and then checking where that piece
[00:00:09] fits in relation to the big picture that
[00:00:12] you know you're meant to form as we pick
[00:00:14] up each new piece we can then compare
[00:00:16] the pieces with each other to see how it
[00:00:19] can form this bigger image and whether
[00:00:21] the image we are actually forming with
[00:00:23] these pieces looks the same so as we
[00:00:26] gain each new piece of information we
[00:00:29] are constantly hypothesizing on the
[00:00:31] typee of image and pattern that it forms
[00:00:34] we are constantly having to make a
[00:00:36] judgment about whether the picture were
[00:00:37] forming actually makes sense or not

[00:00:00] it is a new year which means a new New
[00:00:02] Year's resolution except I have been
[00:00:05] actively avoiding making New Year's
[00:00:07] resolutions for at least 10 years now
[00:00:10] and it has been one of the best
[00:00:11] decisions of my life in this video I'll
[00:00:13] explain why I don't make New Year's
[00:00:16] resolutions and first resolution and
[00:00:18] really the only resolution that you
[00:00:20] should make moving forward I'll be
[00:00:22] talking about a method of
[00:00:24] resolution that has allowed me to
[00:00:27] completely transform my life in terms of
[00:00:30] my fitness and General Health my
[00:00:32] financial stability leaving my career
[00:00:35] pursuing my dream job which apparently
[00:00:38] also involves me just like talking to a
[00:00:40] camera alone inside my room and thinking
[00:00:43] about creating New Year's resolutions in
[00:00:45] the way that most people create New
[00:00:48] Year's resolutions honestly that makes
[00:00:50] me feel really stressed so hopefully
[00:00:53] this video will help you too if you're
[00:00:55] new to this Channel and you're wondering
[00:00:56] who I am I'm Dr Justin Sun I'm a
[00:00:58] learning coach in the head of learning
[00:00:59] at I can study it's my job to look at
[00:01:02] the research on learning and
[00:01:04] self-management and then apply it to
[00:01:06] thousands of people to see what works
[00:01:08] and what doesn't I've been doing this
[00:01:09] now for over a decade working with
[00:01:11] thousands of people from all around the
[00:01:12] world so first of all let's just State
[00:01:14] some of the obvious things which is the
[00:01:16] problem with New Year's resolutions I
[00:01:18] remember I'm fortunate now that I've got
[00:01:20] my gym at home but I used to go to the
[00:01:23] commercial gym and January 1st to like
[00:01:26] January the 10th the gym is just packed
[00:01:29] like yeah there's a line in front of
[00:01:31] every single machine because that's the
[00:01:34] New Year's resolution like this year I'm
[00:01:35] going to get fit by February the gym is
[00:01:39] just empty again it's just back to
[00:01:40] normal and even if you are not the type
[00:01:42] of person that goes to the gym I think
[00:01:44] the analogy kind of makes sense here
[00:01:47] which is that there's this huge Drive of
[00:01:49] motivation we're wanting to achieve all
[00:01:51] these goals for the new year but then
[00:01:53] that Fizzles out very quickly and so I
[00:01:55] often notice a few problems and these
[00:01:56] are also problems that I noticed in
[00:01:58] myself which which is that there are
[00:02:00] often too many goals that are being set
[00:02:03] like I used to want to achieve like my
[00:02:06] dream life by the end of the year and it
[00:02:08] doesn't help that that's often followed
[00:02:10] with a very vague and ambiguous plan and
[00:02:14] actually it's not like I'm deliberately
[00:02:16] trying to create bad plans like I would
[00:02:19] try to create plans that I think are
[00:02:20] pretty effective like okay Monday
[00:02:22] Tuesday Wednesday you know every day I'm
[00:02:24] going to sit aside an hour to do
[00:02:25] whatever but the problem is that I just
[00:02:27] didn't know enough and I think actually
[00:02:29] no one knows enough about a goal that
[00:02:31] they want to achieve to create the
[00:02:34] perfect plan especially if they're in
[00:02:35] the early stages it's only when you
[00:02:37] actually start pursuing the goal do you
[00:02:39] realize what the barriers are and all
[00:02:41] the other variables that you didn't
[00:02:44] consider and probably should have
[00:02:45] considered in your planning but all of
[00:02:47] these things start adding up which
[00:02:48] derails you from the goal and then stops
[00:02:50] you from being able to achieve it and
[00:02:51] because now you're like okay well I sort
[00:02:53] of derailed on this already that whole
[00:02:55] year's plan is sort of just ritten off
[00:02:58] and so ultimately that comes down to the
[00:02:59] effect that there's usually this All or
[00:03:01] Nothing kind of thinking when it comes
[00:03:03] to plans like I'm going to definitely do
[00:03:05] it and achieve this goal and it's going
[00:03:06] to go perfectly or I'm going to give it
[00:03:08] a go next year this must just not be the
[00:03:11] year for it it's like last year was like
[00:03:13] the year of the the rooster and then
[00:03:14] it's like the the year of the the snake
[00:03:16] uh and then next year will be the year
[00:03:18] of achieving my goals all of these
[00:03:20] things contribute to being unmotivated
[00:03:22] at fizzling out and then by the end of
[00:03:24] the year we are in the same position as
[00:03:26] we were at the end of last year which I
[00:03:28] think is really the worst case scenario
[00:03:30] when you're creating a New Year's
[00:03:32] resolution is that the new year brings
[00:03:34] nothing new except for like new
[00:03:36] experiences at failing to achieve a goal
[00:03:39] which is kind of sad but if that happens
[00:03:41] every year is that still a new
[00:03:42] experience anyway I want to introduce
[00:03:45] you to a method of resolution and
[00:03:47] planning that I've been using for
[00:03:49] several years now which is a reason why
[00:03:50] I don't make New Year's resolutions
[00:03:52] anymore and it's because i' never feel
[00:03:55] the need to I get to the end of the year
[00:03:57] and I think okay well what am I going to
[00:03:58] do next year and I think everything that
[00:04:00] I want to do I'm already in the middle
[00:04:03] of doing like all I want is to just
[00:04:06] continue to keep going and so for me New
[00:04:09] Year's resolutions are very meaningless
[00:04:11] there are some people that are really
[00:04:12] against New Year's resolutions I don't
[00:04:14] think there's anything wrong with using
[00:04:16] an opportunity like the end of a year to
[00:04:19] reflect and plan and be a little bit
[00:04:21] more introspective often throughout the
[00:04:22] year we're so busy with things that we
[00:04:24] just don't have the mental time and
[00:04:26] freedom to think about our goals and
[00:04:28] where we are in our lives at higher
[00:04:30] level so New Year's resolution can be an
[00:04:31] amazingly beneficial thing for that
[00:04:33] reason but I also think that it can end
[00:04:35] up being either a waste of time or
[00:04:38] actually make you feel worse because you
[00:04:40] set another goal that you can't achieve
[00:04:42] which is why I want to give you an
[00:04:43] alternative or rather the first
[00:04:45] resolution you should ever create so
[00:04:47] here is the way that I view any kind of
[00:04:50] planning or goal setting in order for
[00:04:52] your actions to have any significant
[00:04:55] impact on your life it needs to stack
[00:04:59] and compound meaningful changes in life
[00:05:01] are usually not possible through just a
[00:05:04] few actions and this is actually fairly
[00:05:06] obvious but it has to com through in our
[00:05:08] planning or how we plan to plan there's
[00:05:11] something in medicine that we call
[00:05:12] ventricular fibrillation colloquially
[00:05:15] it's just called your heart stopping
[00:05:18] when we go into like a cardiac arrest
[00:05:20] what's happening is that our heart is no
[00:05:22] longer pumping blood around our body but
[00:05:25] the thing is when you look at the
[00:05:27] electrical activity of the heart what
[00:05:30] you see is not actually a completely
[00:05:32] flat line at least not at the beginning
[00:05:34] what you see is a lot of up and down
[00:05:38] movement and this is because in order
[00:05:39] for the heart to pump blood effectively
[00:05:42] around the body it has to have a
[00:05:44] synchronous contraction with ventricular
[00:05:47] fibrillation which is when you enter
[00:05:49] into cardiac arrest your heart is no
[00:05:51] longer working in a synchronized way it
[00:05:54] is actually fibrillating which basically
[00:05:56] just means it's vibrating every part of
[00:05:59] the heart is trying to contract at the
[00:06:02] same time and therefore it's not able to
[00:06:05] effectively pump any blood out but in
[00:06:08] terms of sheer activity the heart is
[00:06:11] actually doing more stuff when it is
[00:06:14] just vibrating than when it is doing a
[00:06:18] few synchronized contractions and this
[00:06:20] is exactly the way that I've been trying
[00:06:22] to look at planning and goal setting and
[00:06:25] productivity for years and so one of the
[00:06:27] first really more me meaningful
[00:06:30] resolutions that I ended up making for
[00:06:31] myself which at the time I didn't
[00:06:34] realize how big of an impact this would
[00:06:35] have on my life was I made a resolution
[00:06:38] that I would never feel the need to
[00:06:40] create New Year's resolutions in the
[00:06:42] future and I started thinking how can I
[00:06:44] create enough consistent output
[00:06:47] throughout my life at all times of the
[00:06:49] year so that by the end of the year I
[00:06:52] don't feel the need to make additional
[00:06:55] plans or change the way I'm producing
[00:06:57] output so this year on next year
[00:06:59] depending on when you're watching this
[00:07:01] give this a try try having a monthly
[00:07:04] realignment session with yourself I've
[00:07:07] been doing this every 1 or 2 months for
[00:07:09] the last at least 7 or 8 years and it
[00:07:12] only takes about 30 minutes to an hour
[00:07:14] every one or two months but it makes the
[00:07:17] time between those months so much easier
[00:07:20] and more purposeful during these
[00:07:21] sessions here's what you need to ask
[00:07:23] yourself number one what is my long-term
[00:07:27] Vision when I say long-term Vision I'm
[00:07:29] talking somewhere in the span of maybe 5
[00:07:31] to 10 years and it doesn't have to be
[00:07:33] very specific it just has to be a
[00:07:35] general idea about the type of life you
[00:07:38] want to live the type of values you want
[00:07:40] to live too and the type of person you
[00:07:42] want to be I wouldn't recommend fixing
[00:07:44] on specific careers that you're going to
[00:07:47] have because even if you're like 100%
[00:07:50] sure that that's what you're going to
[00:07:51] end up doing I can tell you for a fact
[00:07:53] when I was 18 years old I was 100% sure
[00:07:57] I was going to stay as a medical doctor
[00:07:59] but but you just don't know what you
[00:08:00] don't know life has a way of throwing
[00:08:02] curve balls at you and what's important
[00:08:04] is that you stay true to living the life
[00:08:06] that you want to live not staying true
[00:08:09] to a random goal that a past version of
[00:08:13] you made which was actually more
[00:08:16] ignorant than the current version of you
[00:08:18] keeping long-term Visions relatively
[00:08:20] Broad and open means that we're not
[00:08:22] trapping ourselves and giving ourselves
[00:08:24] tunnel vision or missing other
[00:08:26] opportunities that could be really
[00:08:27] beneficial for our lives on the other
[00:08:28] hand when you're making short-term goals
[00:08:30] which are days weeks or maybe even a
[00:08:32] couple months out then they should be
[00:08:35] very very specific but longterm goals
[00:08:37] should be broad generally higher level a
[00:08:41] little bit more flexible the second
[00:08:42] question you ask yourself is is my
[00:08:45] long-term Vision the same as what it was
[00:08:48] in my last checkup third we reflect and
[00:08:51] think are the things that I'm doing now
[00:08:53] and the way that I'm spending my time
[00:08:56] aligned to helping me achieve that long
[00:08:59] long term Vision now quite a lot of the
[00:09:01] time the answer is going to be no in the
[00:09:04] modern world I think it is really
[00:09:06] actually very difficult to constantly
[00:09:08] stay always aligned with your long-term
[00:09:11] Vision there are always competing
[00:09:12] commitments and pressures and
[00:09:14] responsibilities that are popping up
[00:09:16] that you feel that you need to address
[00:09:17] and often you do need to address them
[00:09:20] the problem is not that we spend time on
[00:09:22] things that aren't directly contributing
[00:09:24] to our long-term Vision that's just life
[00:09:26] the problem is when we end up never
[00:09:29] committing enough time to our long-term
[00:09:31] vision and therefore at the end of the
[00:09:32] year wondering why has my life not
[00:09:35] changed at all so if the answer is no
[00:09:37] then we ask ourselves the fourth
[00:09:38] question which is why we want to look
[00:09:40] for the barriers or the things that are
[00:09:42] missing what are the things that stop me
[00:09:45] from spending more time and energy to
[00:09:48] align my actions with my long-term
[00:09:50] vision and one of the things that are
[00:09:52] missing that would allow me to overcome
[00:09:55] those barriers or make greater strides
[00:09:57] and this part is actually crucial we
[00:09:59] have to have the mindset that there is a
[00:10:01] solution here somehow that will help and
[00:10:04] our job is to find it there's no point
[00:10:07] saying I've not been able to align
[00:10:09] myself it's not going well and I can't
[00:10:11] because of these barriers and stop there
[00:10:14] we're not on a problem finding mode we
[00:10:16] are in a solution finding mode and often
[00:10:19] the solution is not obvious and it may
[00:10:21] not fix the problem immediately or
[00:10:23] completely but it's about taking steps
[00:10:25] in the right direction for example
[00:10:27] before I LIF clinical medicine one of
[00:10:30] the barriers for me in actually taking
[00:10:31] that step was that if I quit my job I
[00:10:34] would not have any money cuz at the time
[00:10:36] I wasn't even paying myself for working
[00:10:39] in my education business it was running
[00:10:41] as a nonprofit I didn't pay myself for
[00:10:43] the first 4 and a half years so I
[00:10:45] realized that I actually have to start
[00:10:47] paying myself a salary so I can make
[00:10:49] that transition and the barrier for me
[00:10:52] in doing that was that I just didn't
[00:10:55] know how to make money from my business
[00:10:58] effectively enough to do that so the
[00:11:00] barrier that I found was the lack of
[00:11:02] Financial Freedom or lack of financial
[00:11:05] anything and the missing part was my
[00:11:08] knowledge on how to gain that Financial
[00:11:12] something and so the final part of the
[00:11:14] self-reflection activity is to figure
[00:11:15] out the focus what are you going to
[00:11:17] focus on between now and your next
[00:11:20] re-evaluation session a month or two
[00:11:22] from now that is going to essentially
[00:11:25] guarantee that you've made some progress
[00:11:28] toward wards that goal so for me I spent
[00:11:30] a few months just learning and reading
[00:11:33] more talking to people about the idea of
[00:11:35] commercialization and how you can use
[00:11:37] money for impact while also paying
[00:11:40] yourself I talked to a lot of CEOs from
[00:11:42] other social Enterprises and Charities
[00:11:44] about their experiences and their
[00:11:46] struggles I learned about how to raise
[00:11:47] funds and so around 6 months later I was
[00:11:50] able to pay myself out a small salary
[00:11:54] but enough to stay alive on and now that
[00:11:57] that barrier had been removed I was was
[00:11:59] open to many more opportunities that I
[00:12:00] could explore for example the viability
[00:12:03] of leaving clinical medicine to pursue
[00:12:06] this thing that I had for education and
[00:12:08] Entrepreneurship which in retrospect is
[00:12:10] an itch that I'm very glad that I ended
[00:12:12] up scratching and so one of the best
[00:12:13] things about doing these many sessions
[00:12:15] is that it increases massively your
[00:12:18] flexibility and adaptability and your
[00:12:20] motivation like I mentioned before when
[00:12:22] we set ourselves like a one-year goal we
[00:12:25] often don't know enough about what it
[00:12:27] takes to achieve that goal and what are
[00:12:29] the barriers you're likely to face in
[00:12:31] trying to achieve that goal to make a
[00:12:33] good plan to begin with like if you want
[00:12:35] to do couch to Marathon by the end of
[00:12:38] next year one of the barriers you find
[00:12:41] to training regularly might be it's not
[00:12:43] safe to run in the evenings or maybe
[00:12:45] you're just too tired or maybe you're
[00:12:48] just too lazy whatever it is these are
[00:12:51] all barriers that we might just discover
[00:12:53] which we don't necessarily know enough
[00:12:55] to plan for in advance and this is
[00:12:57] normal in fact this is is expected so we
[00:13:00] should expect it by having a more
[00:13:03] regular checkup it allows us to take all
[00:13:06] this information and experience that
[00:13:07] we've gained and re-evaluate our plans
[00:13:10] and because we're also checking up on
[00:13:12] our progress on a monthly basis it's a
[00:13:15] lot more motivating cuz we can see what
[00:13:17] we are doing to systematically unblock
[00:13:20] and remove barriers when we don't think
[00:13:23] of it this way it's very hard to measure
[00:13:25] progress It's either we are achieving
[00:13:27] the goal or we're not not achieving the
[00:13:29] goal but a lot of the time the process
[00:13:31] of achieving a goal is about just
[00:13:33] removing the barriers that stop you from
[00:13:37] committing to achieving the goal in the
[00:13:39] first place and these are serious wins
[00:13:42] that should be motivating but it's not
[00:13:44] going to be motivating if you can't see
[00:13:46] the progress and that is when we can
[00:13:48] start just fibrillating vibrating not
[00:13:51] really achieving any output because we
[00:13:53] don't see how each step we're taking is
[00:13:55] actually progressing us one step at a
[00:13:58] time instead we end up just doing one
[00:14:01] thing and then another thing and then
[00:14:02] another thing and another thing
[00:14:03] desperately trying to reach our goal but
[00:14:07] inadvertently just kind of fluctuating
[00:14:09] because none of our actions are
[00:14:10] compounding and I see this a lot when it
[00:14:12] comes to people trying to improve the
[00:14:14] way that they learn or study is that
[00:14:16] they're looking for something that just
[00:14:17] immediately helps them to improve not
[00:14:20] realizing all the different things that
[00:14:22] are involved in learning to be an
[00:14:24] efficient learner for example we'll have
[00:14:26] people joining our program and they'll
[00:14:28] learn a new technique and they'll
[00:14:30] practice it and try it for like 5 to 10
[00:14:33] minutes and if it's not giving them that
[00:14:35] immediate result in just 10 minutes they
[00:14:37] say okay this is not working for me they
[00:14:39] move on to the next technique another 10
[00:14:40] minutes and it's not working for them
[00:14:42] and then they go through like dozens of
[00:14:44] different techniques never really giving
[00:14:46] themselves a chance to build the skill
[00:14:49] in fact there are even some students
[00:14:51] that will have done this kind of just
[00:14:53] flittering around different techniques
[00:14:55] for months before realizing that the
[00:14:58] thing that actually holds them back the
[00:14:59] most is not realizing that the first
[00:15:03] part of making any progress is just
[00:15:05] removing the barriers that stop you from
[00:15:08] making progress in the first place which
[00:15:11] in this example is the mindset
[00:15:13] perspective and method of practicing new
[00:15:16] skills and in my experience and I'm not
[00:15:18] like some you know like old wise man
[00:15:20] like Asian Guru like with a long beard I
[00:15:23] don't even think I can grow a beard but
[00:15:25] in my experience I found that when you
[00:15:27] remove the barriers to achieving
[00:15:30] something it's generally pretty smooth
[00:15:33] to be able to reach it and for every
[00:15:35] barrier that stays unremoved we have to
[00:15:38] then overcome and hurdle over it with
[00:15:40] more effort and energy and time a lot of
[00:15:43] the time when people create New Year
[00:15:44] resolutions they are just saying okay
[00:15:46] here's what I want they're not thinking
[00:15:48] about the barriers that they're likely
[00:15:49] to expect along the way whereas in
[00:15:51] reality the primary focus for the first
[00:15:54] 5 to 7 months probably should just be
[00:15:58] consistent and diligent barrier removal
[00:16:02] as I said before having these monthly
[00:16:04] realignment sessions has been really
[00:16:06] life-changing for me it's allowed me to
[00:16:08] feel a lot more in control of my life
[00:16:10] and I hope it will be able to do the
[00:16:11] same for you if you do give it a go
[00:16:13] please do come back leave a comment on
[00:16:14] this video to let me know how you found
[00:16:16] it I would love to hear your stories and
[00:16:18] if you want to know how you can do the
[00:16:19] planning part of it on a shortterm basis
[00:16:22] more effectively then I would strongly
[00:16:24] recommend checking out my video In
[00:16:25] Reverse goal setting that I have here
[00:16:27] and if one of you goals is to get better
[00:16:29] at learning or managing your time or
[00:16:31] your tasks then stick around to the end
[00:16:32] of the video because there's a playlist
[00:16:35] which is my curated collection of videos
[00:16:37] that I think will be helpful for you to
[00:16:39] start with thank you so much for
[00:16:40] watching I hope you have a great New
[00:16:42] Year's and I'll see you in the next
[00:16:47] one


=== Why you should stop working harder ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iOHqbcEork

[00:00:00] in the low levels of competition
[00:00:02] especially like Junior High School it's
[00:00:04] enough just to have some hard work
[00:00:06] because most people around you are just
[00:00:08] not working hard so if you're the person
[00:00:10] that's putting in seven or eight out of
[00:00:11] 10 effort while everyone around you is
[00:00:13] putting in two or three out of 10 effort
[00:00:15] then you're probably going to do better
[00:00:17] than them but this is not the case
[00:00:19] usually later in life a lot of people
[00:00:21] feel this in their senior senior years
[00:00:23] of high school going into College
[00:00:24] University where things a little bit
[00:00:26] more challenging certainly in you know
[00:00:28] the professional world just putting in
[00:00:30] more time and more effort is not really
[00:00:32] enough to change things enough and part
[00:00:34] of this is because usually for things
[00:00:37] that are difficult in competitive people
[00:00:38] with Talent are not doing two or three
[00:00:40] out of 10 effort they are also putting
[00:00:42] in five or six out of 10 effort so if
[00:00:45] the difference in Talent between you and
[00:00:47] this other person is too much you just
[00:00:49] cannot compensate for it there is not
[00:00:51] enough time to give


=== The only NY resolution you need to make ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrKafE5UdTc

[00:00:00] I've been trying to look at planning and
[00:00:02] goal setting and productivity for years
[00:00:05] I made a resolution that I would never
[00:00:07] feel the need to create New Year's
[00:00:10] resolutions in the future and I started
[00:00:12] thinking how can I create enough
[00:00:14] consistent output throughout my life at
[00:00:17] all times of the year so that by the end
[00:00:19] of the year I don't feel the need to
[00:00:22] make additional plans or change the way
[00:00:24] I'm producing output so this year try
[00:00:27] having a monthly real alignment session
[00:00:31] with yourself I've been doing this every
[00:00:33] 1 or two months for the last at least 7
[00:00:36] or eight years and it only takes about
[00:00:38] 30 minutes to an hour every one or two
[00:00:40] months but it makes the time between
[00:00:43] those months so much easier and more
[00:00:45] purposeful it just has to be a general
[00:00:47] idea about the type of life you want to
[00:00:50] live the type of values you want to live
[00:00:52] too and the type of person you want to
[00:00:54] be


=== The true benefit of grouping information ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNVYv_bomOw

[00:00:00] I understand you always mentioned that
[00:00:01] grouping information most of the time is
[00:00:02] not how the lecture should group it but
[00:00:03] I find it very difficult to do it
[00:00:05] differently do you have tips the the
[00:00:07] first thing that I'd say is that the
[00:00:08] difficulty that you're finding to try to
[00:00:09] do it is kind of a good thing it's not
[00:00:11] the fact that you end up with a group
[00:00:12] that's providing good learning it's the
[00:00:14] fact that you spent the effort and the
[00:00:16] cognitive resource to try to figure out
[00:00:17] how to group it that's what's activating
[00:00:18] the learning process in your brain if
[00:00:20] you were grouping something and then you
[00:00:21] were grouping it another way and that
[00:00:23] was like so easy for you that probably
[00:00:25] means you'll be doing it wrong cuz
[00:00:26] there's two parts one is understanding
[00:00:28] what the cognitive skill is like the SEC
[00:00:30] quence of thoughts that allow you to
[00:00:31] form alternative groups which is good
[00:00:33] and useful to have but those sequence of
[00:00:34] steps is still cognitively resource
[00:00:36] heavy it's never going to be like
[00:00:38] effortless because that's just not what
[00:00:39] effective learning is like when you do
[00:00:41] tolerate the difficulty you're actually
[00:00:42] getting really good results you're like
[00:00:44] this really makes sense I feel like my
[00:00:45] understanding of it is deeper etc etc in
[00:00:47] which case the the solution is to keep
[00:00:49] doing it it's difficult but do it anyway
[00:00:51] and you'll start to get used to that
[00:00:53] difficulty and your brain will sort of
[00:00:54] recalibrate itself over time


=== Most teachers get this wrong ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn6yiVganBQ

[00:00:00] you don't need to know every intricate
[00:00:01] detail about something to know how to
[00:00:03] think about it first you can get a very
[00:00:05] easy simple few sentences big picture
[00:00:08] idea about what you're talking about why
[00:00:10] it's relevant how you'd use it and get a
[00:00:12] real authentic appreciation of the
[00:00:14] significance and the purpose and how it
[00:00:16] relates to maybe all these other ideas
[00:00:18] and then be like okay cool like I'm now
[00:00:19] ready to like learn more about this and
[00:00:21] that creates more curiosity it creates
[00:00:23] more engagement it creates more
[00:00:25] enjoyment and from a purely practical
[00:00:26] point of view it means knowledge is
[00:00:28] integrated more quickly and you can
[00:00:29] actually use it in a way that it's you
[00:00:31] know meant to be used and that flip is
[00:00:33] something that I don't think I've really
[00:00:34] ever seen in any education system


=== Tips for students with ADHD ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWRKggRWOCU

[00:00:00] what's the best studying method for
[00:00:01] students who have ADHD there's like a
[00:00:02] kind of like a spectrum for ADHD right
[00:00:04] not not just in terms of severity but in
[00:00:05] terms of symptomology of ADHD some
[00:00:08] people have a lot more of the hyperd
[00:00:09] distractability some people have more of
[00:00:10] the hyper Focus some people have both
[00:00:12] some people have distractability in the
[00:00:13] morning and Hyper focus in the evening
[00:00:15] medication is different as well it's a
[00:00:16] bit of a mixed bag generally all the
[00:00:18] methods that I teach are going to be
[00:00:20] suitable but you might have to take some
[00:00:21] extra steps to make those methods more
[00:00:24] likely to be successful one of the
[00:00:25] things that I'd recommend is like really
[00:00:27] being clear about the steps like writing
[00:00:29] down the steps you can use physical cues
[00:00:30] for it using a lot of like timing making
[00:00:32] sure that you're really on the clock
[00:00:33] when it comes to doing those steps so
[00:00:35] like step one pick whatever set of
[00:00:37] systems or if you're already on the
[00:00:38] program use the ones that I teach you
[00:00:39] obviously write down step one be really
[00:00:41] really clear on what it is give yourself
[00:00:43] an amount of time if that time is more
[00:00:44] than 10 minutes maybe break them at
[00:00:46] 10-minute segments and just try to stick
[00:00:47] with that time sticking with that very
[00:00:49] specific step and then between breaks
[00:00:51] reset go for a walk do something and
[00:00:53] when you come back in start the clock
[00:00:55] and then you start again


=== Half of medical school is a waste of time ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZDXQRg7t8I

[00:00:00] if you could redesign medical school
[00:00:01] training you could open up your own
[00:00:02] Medical School how would you structure
[00:00:04] it differently first of all I don't
[00:00:06] think Medical School needs to be 6 years
[00:00:07] okay I don't remember anything I learned
[00:00:09] in second and third year straight up
[00:00:10] like the amount of things I remember for
[00:00:12] the amount of time that was spent in
[00:00:13] preclin is so low the yield of that is
[00:00:17] so low uh and then in clinical practice
[00:00:19] Yeah like there's so much I learned
[00:00:21] through clinical practice but again it
[00:00:22] was that like every day felt up health I
[00:00:24] never walked into clinical practice
[00:00:25] thinking like I'm so ready for the day
[00:00:27] like I know everything that I need to
[00:00:29] know I feel that I'm ready to really
[00:00:30] hone in on my confidence most of the
[00:00:31] time I was thinking I really hope today
[00:00:33] someone doesn't ask me a question that
[00:00:35] makes me seem like an idiot because I
[00:00:36] kind of am because you don't know
[00:00:38] anything every day is catchup


=== STOP your teacher from doing this ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdOAgkPUWdU

[00:00:00] at the end of the day if you giving
[00:00:01] information to a person and then the
[00:00:03] expectation there is this information is
[00:00:04] something that you now need to just like
[00:00:06] commit to memory and then later we'll
[00:00:07] try to make sense of it that is just
[00:00:09] already the wrong order you know it it's
[00:00:10] already the wrong order it really needs
[00:00:12] to be flipped the relevance and the
[00:00:13] structure has to be created first you
[00:00:15] know I think of it sometimes like
[00:00:16] manufacturing you have this mold like a
[00:00:18] cast that's created and then you inject
[00:00:20] like the liquid plastic into it and it
[00:00:22] will mold to fit that shape right like
[00:00:23] you wouldn't I don't know like get
[00:00:24] molten plastic like throw it on the
[00:00:26] floor and then be like oh quickly while
[00:00:27] it's still hot like you know mo mold it
[00:00:29] together and then try to make a
[00:00:30] consistent shape like there has to be
[00:00:32] that mode that's created first a way for
[00:00:34] the knowledge to belong a place for it
[00:00:36] to be before it's filled so that your
[00:00:38] brain knows what to do with it and how
[00:00:40] to think about the information


=== Fixed mindset VS Growth mindset ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QqSRX5VYiY

[00:00:00] how do you react to the idea of making
[00:00:02] mistakes or jumping into the unknown
[00:00:05] with dealing with uncertainty do you
[00:00:08] jump right into it experiment and learn
[00:00:10] from your mistakes or are you Paralyzed
[00:00:13] by a fear of failure being afraid of
[00:00:16] making mistakes and feeling a sense of
[00:00:18] insecurity with failure is what we call
[00:00:21] a fixed mindset whereas the opposite
[00:00:24] where you're open to making mistakes and
[00:00:25] you learn from it and you even thrive in
[00:00:28] it that is called a growth mindset
[00:00:31] because both self-regulation and deep
[00:00:34] processing require practice and time to
[00:00:38] train mistakes are unavoidable in fact
[00:00:41] even if you could avoid them you
[00:00:42] wouldn't want to avoid them because
[00:00:44] making mistakes is where you get most of
[00:00:46] the learning from so if you are limited
[00:00:49] by a fixed mindset it's impossible to
[00:00:52] improve on anything and knowing this can
[00:00:56] make a big difference


=== The key to MORE effective active recall ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM7EQsj-kBw

[00:00:00] active recall this one could easily go
[00:00:02] up to an S being much more deliberate
[00:00:04] with the type of recall that you're
[00:00:06] doing so understanding that you can
[00:00:07] practice recall at a low level facts
[00:00:10] definitions explanations like things
[00:00:12] that you need to potentially just wrot
[00:00:13] memorize but also testing your recall at
[00:00:16] the higher levels uh more complex
[00:00:18] questions more complex problem solving
[00:00:20] more nuanced applications having
[00:00:22] discussions if it's a procedural skill
[00:00:24] like coding or languages having more
[00:00:26] execution and practice working on Mini
[00:00:28] projects a lot of people when they're
[00:00:30] doing active recoil they have like the
[00:00:31] same method and then they just do that
[00:00:33] same method like multiple times as their
[00:00:36] spaced active recoil you really going to
[00:00:38] get a very diminishing level of return
[00:00:41] after you do that the first time it will
[00:00:43] be better to have a different technique
[00:00:44] that you're using for each space
[00:00:46] retrieval where you're covering the
[00:00:47] whole scope of the type of knowledge
[00:00:50] that you need to have rather than just
[00:00:51] like the same thing again and again and
[00:00:52] again


=== Why school is a terrible place to learn ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlnKpnHvYFA

[00:00:00] over 90% of all teaching programs
[00:00:01] internationally are factually inaccurate
[00:00:03] in education that research practice Gap
[00:00:05] is like 50 to 100 years so a lot of the
[00:00:07] mainstream current practices in
[00:00:09] education not only are they you know
[00:00:11] like stuff that's very very far remov
[00:00:12] like decades old but also the Gap is
[00:00:14] widening because you know needs of
[00:00:17] Learners on in a modern society are
[00:00:18] changing faster than the education
[00:00:20] system and the research is able to keep
[00:00:21] up with it like massively outpacing it


=== Beware of BAD studying advice ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0f3Syrf_hU

[00:00:00] if you don't have high deep processing
[00:00:02] which most people don't and you try to
[00:00:04] copy someone that does have high deep
[00:00:07] processing you will probably not have
[00:00:10] the same level of success this single
[00:00:13] fact is the reason why there are so much
[00:00:17] bad studying advice out there people
[00:00:19] with high deep processing can use
[00:00:22] ineffective techniques and still do well
[00:00:25] that's why you might find that many high
[00:00:27] Achievers especially on social media and
[00:00:29] Reddit seem to look down on more
[00:00:32] deliberate learning methods because they
[00:00:35] think it's unnecessary because for them
[00:00:38] it genuinely may be unnecessary most
[00:00:41] high Achievers are also not experienced
[00:00:43] learning coaches so what worked for them
[00:00:46] doesn't necessarily transfer to someone
[00:00:48] else this is one of the reasons why I
[00:00:50] always say take advice from people that
[00:00:52] have had personal success and have been
[00:00:54] able to replicate that success in other
[00:00:57] people


=== How I UPGRADE the Most Popular Study Techniques ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyMA9RwAcGE

[00:00:00] I mean this just plainly sucks so that's
[00:00:03] a d if there was an e it would be an e
[00:00:05] welcome to part two of The Ultimate
[00:00:08] study TI list in the first video I
[00:00:10] ranked some of the most popular
[00:00:11] techniques everything from active recoil
[00:00:13] and space repetition to mind maps
[00:00:15] pomodora technique even sleep but that
[00:00:18] was ranked on the way people normally
[00:00:21] use them in this video what I'm going to
[00:00:23] do is I'm going to rerank them based on
[00:00:25] how good they could be with a few
[00:00:27] adjustments and modifications because
[00:00:29] the thing is because learning happens in
[00:00:31] the brain the same technique can be
[00:00:33] either really good or really bad
[00:00:35] depending on how you execute it if
[00:00:37] you're new to this Channel and you're
[00:00:38] wondering who I am I'm Dr Justin Sun I'm
[00:00:40] a learning coach and the head of
[00:00:40] learning at I can study I'm also a
[00:00:42] former medical doctor and for the last
[00:00:43] decade I have helped train thousands of
[00:00:46] Learners around the world how to learn
[00:00:48] more efficiently before we get started
[00:00:49] with this video I'd really appreciate if
[00:00:51] you give this video a like as we all
[00:00:53] know liking helps with the algorithm and
[00:00:55] that is an S tier move also if you
[00:00:57] haven't watched the first tier list
[00:00:59] video already then I'd recommend that
[00:01:00] you watch that one first so anyway let's
[00:01:02] Jump Right In okay so let me just start
[00:01:04] here at the uh a tier practice papers
[00:01:09] practice papers could easily be an S
[00:01:12] tier if people got rid of the answer
[00:01:15] sheet and then started creating answer
[00:01:17] sheets for themselves really big problem
[00:01:20] with practice papers is that people
[00:01:22] depend way too much on knowing whether
[00:01:24] they got the answer right or wrong but
[00:01:26] actually it doesn't matter if you got it
[00:01:27] right or wrong because the point of
[00:01:29] doing a practice paper is to find a
[00:01:32] knowledge Gap and if you answer a
[00:01:34] question and you're not confident on it
[00:01:35] there's a knowledge Gap there and even
[00:01:36] if you get it right it doesn't change
[00:01:38] the fact that you weren't confident and
[00:01:40] what that means is that if you were to
[00:01:41] get asked a question that's very similar
[00:01:43] to it but a little different you might
[00:01:46] get it wrong because there was a gap
[00:01:48] there and that question maybe didn't
[00:01:51] quite hit it from that exact angle where
[00:01:53] the Gap is so going by confidence as a
[00:01:57] more accurate indicator of whether
[00:01:59] you've got a knowledge Gap and then
[00:02:01] looking through to create your own model
[00:02:03] set of answers is a really great
[00:02:06] generative activity which for the amount
[00:02:09] of time spent is going to be better than
[00:02:11] brain dumps or blurting or summary Pages
[00:02:14] or Cornell note taking it's the same
[00:02:16] advantages of summary Pages blurting all
[00:02:18] of those things but it's much more
[00:02:20] contextually relevant and it's more
[00:02:22] targeted towards where there are
[00:02:23] probably knowledge gaps and you can make
[00:02:25] that even better by getting a group of
[00:02:26] friends together if you don't have
[00:02:28] practice papers you create for each
[00:02:30] other which means that there's like
[00:02:32] another layer of learning because you
[00:02:33] have to create a question that actually
[00:02:35] makes sense and then create your own
[00:02:36] perfect set of answers and you can
[00:02:38] compare that with the answer sheet that
[00:02:40] your friend creates so uh like that's
[00:02:43] that when you do it that way this
[00:02:44] becomes like a double s tier um
[00:02:47] technique Pomodoro Pomodoro um
[00:02:51] probably like it could maybe go from an
[00:02:55] A to like an
[00:02:57] A+ tier um I I'll leave it an a one of
[00:03:01] the things that we can do to really
[00:03:03] easily make it more effective is instead
[00:03:06] of just setting the random time just
[00:03:08] start tracking the amount of time it
[00:03:10] takes before you lose that focus and
[00:03:13] flow and then just take your rest
[00:03:15] depending on how long that flow session
[00:03:17] was for after 25 minutes if you're fully
[00:03:19] in flow there's really no point breaking
[00:03:21] out of that flow to to take a break
[00:03:23] because flow States tend to be quite
[00:03:25] energy efficient and so if you're in
[00:03:27] flow you want to maintain that flow for
[00:03:29] as long long as possible so you could do
[00:03:31] like an hour and a half of good flow
[00:03:33] which is actually pretty impressive like
[00:03:35] you know that's that's probably getting
[00:03:36] to the limit of where I'm reaching like
[00:03:38] Flow State hour and a half 2 hours Max
[00:03:41] and then after that amount of time then
[00:03:43] you take a break which I normally
[00:03:44] recommend to be around a quarter to a
[00:03:46] third of your flow session so if it was
[00:03:48] an hour and a half you take a 30- minute
[00:03:50] break and then after the 30- minute
[00:03:52] break then you get back into it and then
[00:03:54] during the break you should also be
[00:03:56] intentional about the type of activity
[00:03:57] that you do so don't just like start
[00:04:00] playing some games because that's not
[00:04:01] going to end in 30 minutes uh you know
[00:04:04] go for a walk uh do some meditation
[00:04:07] something that's actually going to help
[00:04:08] you to properly rejuvenate and recover
[00:04:10] so when you get back into it you're
[00:04:11] actually able to enter into that flow
[00:04:13] State very quickly I'm giving it an A
[00:04:16] plus rather than an S though even with
[00:04:19] those adaptations because the quality of
[00:04:21] what you can do in a flow State still
[00:04:24] depends on what you're actually doing
[00:04:26] and your ability to do that so for
[00:04:27] example you could be Flow State studying
[00:04:29] but doesn't mean that your studying is
[00:04:30] actually going to be effective if the
[00:04:31] method of studying you're using is not
[00:04:33] effective flow or not is not going to
[00:04:36] change so the next one here findan
[00:04:39] technique uh again you can't really do
[00:04:41] it wrong so that stays at an a active
[00:04:43] recall this this one could easily go up
[00:04:46] to an S just make being much more
[00:04:48] deliberate with the type of recall that
[00:04:50] you're doing so understanding that you
[00:04:52] can practice recall at a low level
[00:04:55] discret um facts definitions uh
[00:04:59] explanation like things that you need to
[00:05:01] potentially just wrote memorize but also
[00:05:03] testing your recall at the higher levels
[00:05:06] more complex questions more complex
[00:05:09] problem solving more nuanced
[00:05:11] applications having discussions if it's
[00:05:13] a procedural skill like coding or
[00:05:15] languages having more execution and
[00:05:17] practice working on many projects so a
[00:05:20] lot of people usually when they're doing
[00:05:21] active recall they have like the same
[00:05:23] method and then they just do that same
[00:05:25] method like multiple times as their
[00:05:27] spaced active recoil and you're really
[00:05:31] going to get a very diminishing level of
[00:05:33] return after you do that the first time
[00:05:36] it will be better to have a different
[00:05:37] technique that you're using for each
[00:05:39] space retrieval where you're covering
[00:05:41] the whole scope of the type of knowledge
[00:05:44] that you need to have rather than just
[00:05:45] like the same thing again and again and
[00:05:46] again pre-study easily hands down can
[00:05:50] shoot up to s double s Triple S one of
[00:05:53] the most important things that you can
[00:05:54] do by priming your brain priming
[00:05:57] basically means that you give your brain
[00:05:59] a scaffold like a skeleton of relevance
[00:06:02] before learning a new topic and this is
[00:06:07] essentially like quite easy to do
[00:06:09] because all you have to do is try to
[00:06:11] create a big picture of understanding
[00:06:13] about what the main ideas are and how
[00:06:14] they relate together and maybe just like
[00:06:16] the key Concepts and just don't worry
[00:06:17] about memorizing any details or like
[00:06:19] really being able to explain anything
[00:06:21] you know too much the problem is that a
[00:06:24] lot of people struggle to do that
[00:06:25] because they have such like deeply
[00:06:28] ingrained habits of trying to memorize
[00:06:30] every single detail like usually out of
[00:06:33] insecurity and that's the thing that
[00:06:35] actually holds them back so if you do
[00:06:36] correct pre-study and you know you've
[00:06:39] done it correctly if by the end of it
[00:06:41] you can say what a topic is about and
[00:06:44] the main ideas and how they connect to
[00:06:46] each other and why it's important but
[00:06:49] you cannot explain the actual processes
[00:06:52] or give the actual definitions if you
[00:06:55] can do it to that level of detail after
[00:06:58] pre-study you've probably done it
[00:07:02] wrong and this is a little bit more
[00:07:04] complicated than just what I've made it
[00:07:06] out to be but I I would say that for
[00:07:08] most of you watching this like 99% of
[00:07:11] you watching this unless you're already
[00:07:12] on my program I would say that that's
[00:07:15] that's going to be like a rule that you
[00:07:17] should follow like I really don't think
[00:07:19] you're going to go wrong if you follow
[00:07:20] that rule uh pneumonics probably can be
[00:07:23] and a by ironically using it l there are
[00:07:29] some things that you you just should not
[00:07:31] have in pneumonics because that's not
[00:07:32] how you need to use that knowledge
[00:07:34] anyway pneumonics are good for when you
[00:07:36] need to remember things almost like a
[00:07:39] checklist um you don't need to use that
[00:07:41] information in many other ways other
[00:07:43] than just like a checklist when you
[00:07:45] start using pneumonics to learn things
[00:07:47] where you actually have to manipulate
[00:07:49] that knowledge like in a more multi-
[00:07:51] relational way pneumonics can actually
[00:07:53] hold you back because it's almost like
[00:07:56] putting a lot of tools that you use very
[00:07:58] often but you keep it inside like a
[00:08:01] single locked toolbox every time you
[00:08:03] want to use that tool which could be
[00:08:05] like very frequently you then have to
[00:08:07] unlock the toolbox and open it up and
[00:08:09] then take everything out and then like
[00:08:10] put it back in so it it requires more
[00:08:13] effort to like unpackage and go through
[00:08:14] the pneumonic and then pull the
[00:08:15] information out and then reconnect it
[00:08:17] and then apply it to what you want to to
[00:08:19] to use it for it would actually just be
[00:08:21] better to learn it in a way that already
[00:08:24] connects it to how you need to use it
[00:08:26] and that's going to improve your memory
[00:08:27] and your depth of understanding and it's
[00:08:29] also just less effort and energy to use
[00:08:32] the information at the end of the day so
[00:08:34] the key to making your monics more
[00:08:36] effective is understand what it's good
[00:08:38] for and just don't use it for situation
[00:08:40] where it's not effective for that
[00:08:42] Cornell not taking probably caps out of
[00:08:43] a b again you can't really do it wrong
[00:08:46] um and even when you do it right it's
[00:08:48] you know like there there's limited
[00:08:50] benefits brain dumps and blurting I
[00:08:52] think can stay at a c there's a chance
[00:08:55] that brain dumps can get to a b uh and
[00:08:58] the way that you're do this is that you
[00:09:01] create a brain dump that is deliberately
[00:09:04] different to the way that you have
[00:09:07] initially written your notes and
[00:09:08] understood it like you are deliberately
[00:09:10] trying to create relationships
[00:09:12] structures orders hierarchies headings
[00:09:16] flows logic narratives that are
[00:09:19] different to how you first learned it to
[00:09:21] force yourself to understand the
[00:09:23] information in a different perspective
[00:09:25] and through a different structure the
[00:09:27] reason is because a true expert on the
[00:09:29] topic can probably explain that topic in
[00:09:31] multiple different ways and from
[00:09:33] multiple different angles emphasizing
[00:09:36] different things depending on the
[00:09:37] circumstance and situation whereas a
[00:09:40] like a noob pretty much can't and they
[00:09:43] have to just start at the beginning and
[00:09:45] they just go through and it's it's very
[00:09:46] fixed the way that they've understood
[00:09:48] the topic that's problematic because you
[00:09:50] often have to use your knowledge in a
[00:09:51] way that's not just fixed so learning to
[00:09:55] do a brain dump in a way that is
[00:09:57] deliberately different to how you
[00:09:59] previously thought about it is one way
[00:10:01] of pretty much instantaneously upgrading
[00:10:04] the usefulness of this technique summary
[00:10:06] Pages uh I mean can probably be be if
[00:10:11] you were to do the same thing like
[00:10:12] basically the same thing as brains but
[00:10:13] again you try to summarize it in a
[00:10:14] different way mind maps can be S tier
[00:10:18] because mind maps and really any
[00:10:21] variation of relational nonlinear note
[00:10:24] taking is kind of the only possible way
[00:10:28] to write notes where it is directly
[00:10:32] aligned with higher order relational
[00:10:34] thinking and good deep processing which
[00:10:36] is the processes that contribute to
[00:10:38] having better memory and deeper
[00:10:39] understanding of information and and
[00:10:42] even like using apps like notion or or
[00:10:44] whatever you're using that create these
[00:10:46] relational D databases like REM node uh
[00:10:49] obsidian Rome research even at the end
[00:10:52] of the day the fact that you can
[00:10:55] visually represent on a single page on
[00:10:58] canvas the relationships and the fact
[00:11:00] that you don't have the benefit of
[00:11:02] Technology making it easier for you that
[00:11:06] actually makes it more effective for
[00:11:07] learning because now you have to hold
[00:11:09] yourself to such a high standard for
[00:11:12] where you put things on a page how you
[00:11:14] connect it why you connected there how
[00:11:16] thick you make the arrow all of these
[00:11:18] things play a part in your judgment of
[00:11:21] the importance and place that that
[00:11:23] information sits relative to every other
[00:11:25] piece of information and so for that
[00:11:28] reason my maps can be really effective
[00:11:31] however it's there's a lot that I can
[00:11:34] talk about with this and there there are
[00:11:36] many more conditions to make mind maps
[00:11:38] really effective if you have previous
[00:11:40] used it before and you found that it was
[00:11:42] kind of a waste of time or if you're
[00:11:44] just want to know how you can make it
[00:11:45] even better I would really recommend
[00:11:47] checking out my video on why mind maps
[00:11:49] are useless for a lot of people okay
[00:11:53] flash cards flash cards can be really
[00:11:56] effective just like pneumonics can I'm
[00:11:58] I'm going to put flash cards
[00:12:00] in
[00:12:02] uh B uh because again for what they're
[00:12:06] good for they are excellent for as long
[00:12:09] as you know what they are useful for and
[00:12:11] you do not use it in situations that
[00:12:12] it's not useful for now you might be
[00:12:15] wondering okay so in what situations are
[00:12:17] they or are they not useful that's going
[00:12:19] to be another big one to explain I would
[00:12:22] probably recommend checking out my video
[00:12:23] on how you can make flash cards more
[00:12:26] effective first as a starting point and
[00:12:29] you'll see that there's a lot more
[00:12:31] levels of flash card proficiency that we
[00:12:34] can add to to bring the value out of it
[00:12:37] in fact to be honest actually I would
[00:12:38] say that if you use flash cards in the
[00:12:40] way that I talk about in that video this
[00:12:43] can possibly be even an A but you have
[00:12:46] to be really strategic with it watching
[00:12:48] videos and mixtures and essentially just
[00:12:50] re-watching or just consuming content
[00:12:52] mindlessly is by definition useless so
[00:12:55] that's a d it's forever a d listening to
[00:12:58] music is is a generally speaking I'm I
[00:13:02] recommend people to just have silence or
[00:13:05] white noise uh even lowii beats things
[00:13:08] like that it's probably actually more
[00:13:10] distracting than it is helpful the
[00:13:13] reason that sometimes people find it
[00:13:14] useful is that it helps them to
[00:13:16] concentrate and enter into a flow but
[00:13:18] this is the problem which is like it's
[00:13:22] like funny and sad in a way if the music
[00:13:26] is helping you enter into flow what that
[00:13:29] means is that the process that you were
[00:13:30] trying to use in the first place was
[00:13:33] inherently not engaging and what's
[00:13:36] happened is that you're able to enter
[00:13:37] into flow because the music is the thing
[00:13:40] that is keeping you like in inflow like
[00:13:42] in a sense of Rhythm now that's
[00:13:44] problematic because that usually only
[00:13:47] happens if the level of thinking that
[00:13:50] you're using while learning is low and
[00:13:52] relatively passive if you're engaging in
[00:13:55] the right types of thinking while you're
[00:13:57] learning which you should be because
[00:13:59] that's what gives you good memory and
[00:14:00] understanding and that's what makes your
[00:14:01] time worthwhile then it should be very
[00:14:05] very engaging and your mind ends up
[00:14:07] being very busy and you should naturally
[00:14:10] find that any form of Music
[00:14:13] whatsoever is actually distracting
[00:14:16] because you now have to invest cognitive
[00:14:18] resources in ignoring the music so that
[00:14:21] you can think about what you're meant to
[00:14:23] be thinking about and it doesn't matter
[00:14:25] whether it's instrumental or it's your
[00:14:27] classical music whatever it is
[00:14:29] uh it's it's just the way that your
[00:14:31] cognitive resources are distributed so
[00:14:33] if you find that listening to music
[00:14:34] helps you to
[00:14:36] study I would I'm 90% confident that it
[00:14:40] means that the way you're trying to
[00:14:42] study in the first place is actually not
[00:14:44] very
[00:14:45] effective listening to music can be
[00:14:48] helpful if you're doing tasks and
[00:14:50] activities that have a lower level of
[00:14:53] cognitive load investment in the first
[00:14:55] place a great example of this would be
[00:14:57] anything that is like te tedious like I
[00:14:59] know a lot of like software engineers
[00:15:00] and coders they like to listen to music
[00:15:02] because what they need is attention to
[00:15:04] detail but they don't need to be doing a
[00:15:06] lot of like higher level cognitive
[00:15:09] thinking and so the listening to music
[00:15:11] can be effective for that if you're
[00:15:13] doing like admin tasks or um for example
[00:15:16] like if I'm doing some kind of art or
[00:15:18] you know sort of creative type thing
[00:15:20] then listening to music is going to be
[00:15:21] effective but anything that requires me
[00:15:23] to like properly sit down and think
[00:15:25] music's a definite no so I don't know
[00:15:29] what that means maybe a boost it up to a
[00:15:32] c as long as you don't use it when you
[00:15:34] need to do heavy thinking and you only
[00:15:35] use it for the tedious stuff yeah it's
[00:15:37] it's great it's good it makes things
[00:15:38] more fun rereading and
[00:15:42] highlighting like I said it's just kind
[00:15:45] of useless um I I I don't think I'll
[00:15:50] ever be in a situation where I would
[00:15:52] find that it is worth doing that
[00:15:54] compared to anything else so I I don't I
[00:15:59] don't see a way that you can make that
[00:16:01] more effective than almost useless so
[00:16:04] I'd say that's a deep and there we have
[00:16:06] it the uh ultimate study tier list for
[00:16:10] some of the most common study techniques
[00:16:12] and I know I didn't cover every study
[00:16:14] technique and there are so many other
[00:16:16] ways that you know we can talk about
[00:16:18] this and for each of these things I I
[00:16:20] have a whole series of videos talking
[00:16:22] about it in more depth if any of them
[00:16:24] particularly interested you I'd love to
[00:16:26] know leave your comment down below

=== How to use practice papers as an S-tier technique ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxCwMRLOxVk

[00:00:00] practice papers could easily be an S
[00:00:03] tier if people got rid of the answer
[00:00:05] sheet and then started creating answer
[00:00:06] sheets for themselves the point of doing
[00:00:09] a practice paper is to find a knowledge
[00:00:12] Gap and if you answer a question and
[00:00:13] you're not confident on it there's a
[00:00:14] knowledge Gap there and even if you get
[00:00:16] it right it doesn't change the fact that
[00:00:17] you weren't confident so going by
[00:00:19] confidence as a more accurate indicator
[00:00:22] of whether you've got a knowledge Gap
[00:00:23] and then looking through to create your
[00:00:25] own model set of answers is a really
[00:00:28] great generative activity and you can
[00:00:30] make that even better by getting a group
[00:00:31] of friends together if you don't have
[00:00:33] practice papers you create papers for
[00:00:35] each other which means that there's like
[00:00:36] another layer of learning because you
[00:00:38] have to create a question that actually
[00:00:39] makes sense and then create your own
[00:00:41] perfect set of answers and you can
[00:00:42] compare that with the answer sheet that
[00:00:44] your friend creates so when you do it
[00:00:46] that way this becomes like a double s
[00:00:48] tier technique


=== Most doctors won't tell you this ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHq_h96iNaQ

[00:00:00] when I left clinical medicine not many
[00:00:02] doctors asked me why they were mostly
[00:00:03] just like how I think every medical
[00:00:06] person knows why someone would leave
[00:00:08] clinical practice working as a doctor
[00:00:10] was very like demotivating because I
[00:00:11] felt so powerless to do so many of the
[00:00:14] things that I wanted to do with my work
[00:00:15] or the type of impact or even just
[00:00:17] simple things like if I want to go to a
[00:00:18] friend's wedding like I shouldn't need
[00:00:19] to get leave seven different times
[00:00:21] across you know 4 months just to be able
[00:00:23] to hit that I hated the idea of waking
[00:00:25] up in a Sunday and thinking like oh crap
[00:00:27] it's Sunday like I have to get up for
[00:00:29] work tomorrow morning you know it's a
[00:00:30] Monday and then like counting down the
[00:00:31] days until the weekend which I not I
[00:00:33] know that not everyone is like that but
[00:00:34] for me that's the experience that I had
[00:00:36] when I was working as a doctor I really
[00:00:37] dreaded the work and if I thought like
[00:00:39] yeah it's I guess it's okay and then I
[00:00:40] thought well would I rather just be at
[00:00:41] home


=== Unlock the power of deep processing ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXLPvH8GiDo

[00:00:00] deep processing is the ability to think
[00:00:02] critically make connections between
[00:00:04] ideas extract meaningful learning from
[00:00:07] information and understand complex
[00:00:09] Concepts most people with deep
[00:00:10] processing are high Achievers and they
[00:00:13] have high deep processing because of
[00:00:15] combination of genetics and childhood
[00:00:18] experiences here's the important part of
[00:00:19] deep processing though deep processing
[00:00:22] can be trained your brain has this thing
[00:00:24] called neuroplasticity which is the
[00:00:26] ability for it to mold and adapt based
[00:00:28] on the pressures that you put on it
[00:00:30] that's how we form new habits deep
[00:00:31] processing is just a series of habits
[00:00:35] related to learning and they can be
[00:00:37] trained not every person is going to
[00:00:39] become the genius but everyone can get
[00:00:42] better


=== Most people are too scared to do this ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NVfsoLLSLU

[00:00:00] hard work is not just more work do the
[00:00:02] things that are uncomfortable because no
[00:00:03] one else can be bothered to and if
[00:00:05] you're the one that can be bothered to
[00:00:06] do the thing that's uncomfortable then
[00:00:08] that means that you're the one that's
[00:00:09] going to get the uncommon results


=== Ranking the MOST effective study technique ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwk4KRyinTY

[00:00:00] pre-study easily hands down can shoot up
[00:00:03] to s double s Triple S one of the most
[00:00:06] important things that you can do by
[00:00:07] priming your brain priming basically
[00:00:10] means that you give your brain a
[00:00:11] scaffold like a skeleton of relevance
[00:00:14] before learning a new topic all you have
[00:00:16] to do is try to create a big picture of
[00:00:18] understanding about what the main ideas
[00:00:19] are and how they relate together and
[00:00:21] maybe just like the key Concepts and
[00:00:22] just don't worry about memorizing any
[00:00:24] details or like really being able to
[00:00:25] explain anything you know too much the
[00:00:27] problem is that a lot of people struggle
[00:00:29] to do that because they have such like
[00:00:31] deeply ingrained habits of trying to
[00:00:33] memorize every single detail usually out
[00:00:35] of insecurity and that's the thing that
[00:00:37] actually holds them back so if you do
[00:00:38] correct pre-study and you know you've
[00:00:40] done it correctly if by the end of it
[00:00:41] you can say what a topic is about and
[00:00:44] the main ideas and how they connect to
[00:00:46] each other and why it's important but
[00:00:48] you cannot explain the actual processes
[00:00:51] or give the actual definitions


=== The BIGGEST problem with practice papers ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqgf3N2_11Q

[00:00:00] really big problem with practice papers
[00:00:02] is that people depend way too much on
[00:00:04] knowing whether they got the answer
[00:00:05] right or wrong but actually it doesn't
[00:00:07] matter if you got it right or wrong
[00:00:08] because the point of doing a practice
[00:00:10] paper is to find a knowledge Gap and if
[00:00:13] you answer a question and you're not
[00:00:14] confident on it there's a knowledge Gap
[00:00:15] there and even if you get it right it
[00:00:17] doesn't change the fact that you weren't
[00:00:18] confident and what that means is that if
[00:00:20] you were to get asked a question that's
[00:00:21] very similar to it but a little
[00:00:23] different you might get it wrong because
[00:00:25] there was a gap there and that question
[00:00:27] maybe didn't quite hit it from that
[00:00:30] exact angle where the Gap is so going by
[00:00:33] confidence as a more accurate indicator
[00:00:35] of whether you've got a knowledge Gap
[00:00:36] and then looking through to create your
[00:00:38] own model set of answers is a really
[00:00:41] great generative activity which for the
[00:00:43] amount of time spent is going to be
[00:00:45] better than brain dumps or blurting or
[00:00:47] summary pages and it's more targeted
[00:00:49] towards where there are probably
[00:00:51] knowledge gaps


=== Stop focusing on your exams results ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGya2sIRJB8

[00:00:00] don't chase outcomes I work with a lot
[00:00:01] of students they get very stressed about
[00:00:03] exams they get a bad exam result and
[00:00:05] then they sort of spiral uncontrollably
[00:00:07] and then every subsequent exam is like
[00:00:09] more and more anxiety we don't want that
[00:00:10] the thing about an outcome is that
[00:00:12] you're only in control of a small
[00:00:13] portion of it right an outcome is the
[00:00:15] result of your actions other actions
[00:00:17] other people's actions and just random
[00:00:18] probability which you can't control to
[00:00:20] my best knowledge but if you don't have
[00:00:22] a good outcome and you're fixed on just
[00:00:23] chasing this outcome I know people that
[00:00:25] print out the University degree that
[00:00:27] they want to enter into and they they
[00:00:28] stick it on their ceiling so they when
[00:00:29] they wake up is the first thing they see
[00:00:31] they're like I'm manifesting my my dream
[00:00:33] career like they're levitating off their
[00:00:35] bid into University but it doesn't work
[00:00:37] that way


=== Is the Feynman Technique ACTUALLY effective? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4LltasC-M

[00:00:00] refan technique it's otherwise just
[00:00:01] called like self teing or like
[00:00:04] self-explanation refan technique is a
[00:00:07] very good method because it's easy to
[00:00:09] learn it's creating a lot of free recall
[00:00:11] opportunities it's also creating
[00:00:13] retrieval opportunities at multiple
[00:00:15] different levels of learning uh it
[00:00:17] requires you to synthesize and simplify
[00:00:19] and evaluate the quality of your
[00:00:21] learning so it's good for Gap finding
[00:00:22] it's generally more time efficient and
[00:00:25] that you're going to find more gaps that
[00:00:26] are more high yield that are at
[00:00:28] different levels than you would with
[00:00:30] brain dumps or blurting so I'm going to
[00:00:33] give findan technique probably in the a
[00:00:35] category if people are using the fan
[00:00:37] technique generally speaking their
[00:00:38] Learning System tends to be reasonably
[00:00:41] decent


=== This is why you're not a top student ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBQZ35VLRh0

[00:00:00] let's say that we took 10,000 students
[00:00:02] and let's say that of these 10,000
[00:00:04] students all 10,000 of them are using a
[00:00:06] particular technique and of that 10,000
[00:00:08] students 1,000 of them are successful
[00:00:11] what is the success rate of this
[00:00:12] technique yell it out 10% okay now if
[00:00:15] everyone is doing something every top
[00:00:17] achiever will also be doing that thing
[00:00:20] okay so you do not want to have just a
[00:00:22] tip that all the high Achievers are
[00:00:24] doing you want to do something that only
[00:00:26] they are doing right you don't want
[00:00:27] something that 90% of people do where %
[00:00:30] of them are successful you want
[00:00:31] something that 10% of people do where
[00:00:33] 90% of the people that do that are
[00:00:35] successful right


=== Flashcards ≠ Spaced repetition ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3WCO-XCJ_g

[00:00:00] space repetition which is really one of
[00:00:02] the driving principles behind flash
[00:00:04] cards I think a lot of people will say
[00:00:05] space repetition flash cards are the
[00:00:07] same thing but they're not because space
[00:00:08] repetition can be in any form whereas
[00:00:10] flash cards are a very specific format
[00:00:12] of doing space repetition the idea of
[00:00:14] space retrieval and space retrieval
[00:00:17] practice is very advantageous and if
[00:00:19] you're doing some kind of space
[00:00:20] retrieval practice that's good now if
[00:00:22] that retrieval practice is not done very
[00:00:24] well it's not going to be as effective
[00:00:27] as it could be but as a fundamental
[00:00:28] principle you should be spacing
[00:00:30] retrieval sessions the reason that most
[00:00:33] people won't get the full benefit from
[00:00:34] it is not because they don't understand
[00:00:36] space repetition but it's because the
[00:00:38] rate that they're forgetting information
[00:00:39] is so fast that you have to basically be
[00:00:42] repeating things like every couple days
[00:00:44] otherwise you're forgetting so much so
[00:00:46] quickly that the next time you do it
[00:00:48] you're just like overwhelmed


=== Music + Study  = DISTRACTING?! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ5mPKZEtck

[00:00:00] listening to music even lowii beats
[00:00:02] things like that it's actually more
[00:00:04] distracting than it is helpful the
[00:00:06] reason that sometimes people find it
[00:00:07] useful is that it helps them to
[00:00:09] concentrate and enter into a flow but
[00:00:11] this is the problem if the music is
[00:00:13] helping you enter into flow what that
[00:00:15] means is that the process that you were
[00:00:17] trying to use in the first place was
[00:00:19] inherently not engaging you're able to
[00:00:21] enter into flow because the music is the
[00:00:24] thing that is keeping you inlow like in
[00:00:26] a sense of Rhythm now that's problematic
[00:00:28] because that usually only happens if the
[00:00:30] level of thinking that you're using
[00:00:32] while learning is low and relatively
[00:00:35] passive if you're engaging in the right
[00:00:36] types of thinking while you're learning
[00:00:38] which you should be because that's what
[00:00:40] gives you good memory and understanding
[00:00:41] and that's what makes your time
[00:00:42] worthwhile your mind ends up being very
[00:00:44] busy and you should naturally find that
[00:00:47] any form of Music whatsoever is actually
[00:00:50] distracting


=== What if you only had to study 4hrs a week? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_b_W9l4tM4

[00:00:00] and by the time I graduated I'd gone
[00:00:01] from studying 20 hours a day to around 3
[00:00:02] to 4 hours per week I started looking
[00:00:04] into the research I really abused the
[00:00:06] institutional access to journals that
[00:00:08] you get when you're a university student
[00:00:09] and I really trial and erid a lot with
[00:00:12] my own study techniques and then I was
[00:00:13] teaching students what I was learning
[00:00:15] about learning efficiency graduated with
[00:00:16] four distinctions in a first class
[00:00:17] honors and three research Publications
[00:00:19] while I was at Uni I managed to be the
[00:00:21] exec of two University clubs I was on
[00:00:22] the committee for three national
[00:00:24] conferences I started and managed two
[00:00:25] businesses and a nonprofit organization
[00:00:27] I went to the gym and I danced for 10 to
[00:00:30] hours a week on top of full-time medical
[00:00:32] study and so now I basically teach that
[00:00:34] stuff to other people I managed to
[00:00:36] complete my full-time master of
[00:00:37] education which is a one-year course in
[00:00:39] 6 weeks while I was running my
[00:00:40] businesses and I've now taught these
[00:00:42] learning skills to over 10,000 people in
[00:00:44] 120 countries I've pretty much like the
[00:00:46] best job I travel around the world and I
[00:00:48] give workshops to students like yourself
[00:00:49] or to companies to professionals
[00:00:51] scientists about how to learn more
[00:00:53] efficiently


=== Learning Expert Ranks Study Techniques From Best to Worst ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkjVaMDheJ4

[00:00:00] what are the best studying techniques in
[00:00:03] this video I'm going to do a tier list
[00:00:05] on some of the most common techniques
[00:00:07] that people use for studying if you're
[00:00:09] new to this Channel and wondering who I
[00:00:11] am I'm Dr Justin Sun I'm a learning
[00:00:13] coach and the head of learning at I can
[00:00:14] study I'm also a former medical doctor
[00:00:16] for the last decade I've trained
[00:00:17] thousands of people to learn more
[00:00:19] efficiently unlike a normal tier list
[00:00:21] I'm actually going to do this in two
[00:00:22] parts and the first one I'm going to
[00:00:24] just rank them as how people normally
[00:00:27] tend to use the technique and then I'm
[00:00:29] going to then rerank them based on how
[00:00:32] good they could be if they were either
[00:00:34] used the right way or with a few
[00:00:37] modifications that would make them a lot
[00:00:38] more effective but first the tier list
[00:00:41] based on the way I normally see people
[00:00:45] using these methods and so the first
[00:00:47] item on this list is to give this video
[00:00:50] a like because it really helps with the
[00:00:52] algorithm which motivates me to make
[00:00:54] more free content but anyway starting
[00:00:56] with the real first one on the list is
[00:00:58] pre-study so pre-study is a uh a pretty
[00:01:03] common kind of method that people will
[00:01:04] use it's basically just talking about
[00:01:06] studying something before learning it in
[00:01:09] what I call a main learning event which
[00:01:11] is basically like a lecture or maybe an
[00:01:13] intensive study session it's the time
[00:01:15] where you're thinking this is the first
[00:01:16] time I'm seriously going to sit down to
[00:01:18] properly study it that would be the main
[00:01:21] learning event and a pre-study is just
[00:01:24] any type of study that you do before
[00:01:27] that and uh I would say that the way
[00:01:29] that most most people do it can be of
[00:01:32] mixed Effectiveness uh and I'm going to
[00:01:34] give that a b pretty decent uh but this
[00:01:39] is definitely one that can really get
[00:01:41] better with a few modifications which
[00:01:42] we'll talk about in the second part next
[00:01:44] one is practice papers practice papers
[00:01:48] can be kind of a hidden miss a lot of
[00:01:50] people love practice papers for good
[00:01:53] reason and they can't be really
[00:01:54] effective um I would say that it's
[00:01:57] harder to do this wrong and so the
[00:01:59] common way that people use practice
[00:02:00] papers is not too bad and it's genuinely
[00:02:03] a pretty good way of practicing your
[00:02:06] retrieval and finding knowledge gaps as
[00:02:08] well as being able to test your
[00:02:09] knowledge at different levels of
[00:02:11] learning so I'm going to give this an a
[00:02:14] next on the list is brain dumps now if
[00:02:16] you watched my video on reacting to Tik
[00:02:18] Tok advice you know that blurting which
[00:02:21] is essentially a brain dump equivalent
[00:02:25] is a very commonly recommended
[00:02:30] uh method of studying which I think has
[00:02:35] kind of limited benefits especially in
[00:02:37] the way that people say to do it brain
[00:02:39] dumps can be again an effective way of
[00:02:42] full uncued or otherwise called free
[00:02:45] recall uh which is basically whenever
[00:02:47] you take anything from your memory and
[00:02:49] you just well I guess yeah like dump it
[00:02:52] out and that can be really helpful I've
[00:02:54] definitely used this a lot in the past
[00:02:56] and I recommend a lot of my students to
[00:02:57] use brain dumps um but but the thing
[00:03:00] with brain dumps is that they are very
[00:03:03] timec consuming inherently and there's
[00:03:04] not really any way to get past that and
[00:03:07] it's not a problem if that time returns
[00:03:09] for you a really high level of learning
[00:03:12] but the way that a lot of people do
[00:03:13] brain dumps it doesn't tend to hit that
[00:03:16] level of quality so I'm going to
[00:03:19] probably give this
[00:03:22] a I'm probably going to give this a c I
[00:03:25] think for the amount of time that you
[00:03:27] spend there are a lot of other things
[00:03:29] you can do that will probably be better
[00:03:32] okay another one Pomodoro Technique I've
[00:03:34] got a video on why the Pomodoro
[00:03:36] Technique is not that great and this is
[00:03:38] also the reason why a lot of people
[00:03:39] don't use the Pomodoro Technique long
[00:03:42] term having said that it is a really
[00:03:44] easy great starter technique there's no
[00:03:47] learning curve and if you use it it's
[00:03:49] it's pretty effective straight away
[00:03:51] there are things that you can do to make
[00:03:52] it even better but that doesn't stop it
[00:03:54] from being pretty good to begin with um
[00:03:57] and I think if this is something that
[00:03:58] you really struggle with which is like
[00:03:59] Focus focus and concentration I actually
[00:04:01] think that this is a very solid starting
[00:04:03] point I'm actually going to give it an a
[00:04:05] flash cards you know a lot of you will
[00:04:08] know about my channel because how I love
[00:04:10] to hate on flash cards but I don't hate
[00:04:12] flash cards flash cards can be an
[00:04:14] incredibly important and effective tool
[00:04:17] when you're learning when you're using
[00:04:18] it the right way it's just that if you
[00:04:21] don't use it the right way it can be
[00:04:24] very easy to get overwhelmed uh you can
[00:04:27] drown in your flash cards and again
[00:04:29] flash cards are not great at testing you
[00:04:30] in more complex types of learning and
[00:04:32] types of knowledge so there are certain
[00:04:35] situations where flash cards are very
[00:04:36] good but most people don't know what
[00:04:39] those situations are they don't know
[00:04:40] what conditions flash cards perform well
[00:04:42] in and which situations it would make
[00:04:44] you worse in I think based on just my
[00:04:47] experience with seeing how people tend
[00:04:49] to use it I'm going to give this a I'm
[00:04:53] actually going to give this a straightup
[00:04:55] d which I know like just chill out calm
[00:05:00] down let me finish but I don't hate
[00:05:03] flash cards let me explain flash cards
[00:05:05] can be really effective I'm going to go
[00:05:07] through how you can make it more
[00:05:08] effective later in the second part but
[00:05:11] 100% the way that most people use it it
[00:05:14] does make their whole experience of
[00:05:16] learning much harder than it needs to be
[00:05:20] and so because it's actually doing more
[00:05:22] harm than good and a lot of situations
[00:05:24] compared to what they could be doing
[00:05:25] right not compared to not studying at
[00:05:27] all like it's going to be good if you're
[00:05:28] not studying at all but compared to what
[00:05:30] you could be doing in the same amount of
[00:05:31] time with the same amount of effort yeah
[00:05:33] I got to give it a d all right the next
[00:05:35] one is space repetition which is uh
[00:05:38] really one of the driving principles
[00:05:39] behind flash cards the difference I
[00:05:42] think a lot of people will say space
[00:05:43] repetition flash cards are the same
[00:05:44] thing but they're not because space
[00:05:45] repetition can be in any form whereas
[00:05:48] flash cards are a very specific format
[00:05:50] of doing space repetition the idea of
[00:05:53] space retrieval and space retrieval
[00:05:55] practice is very advantageous and if
[00:05:58] you're doing some kind of space
[00:06:00] retrieval practice that's good now if
[00:06:02] that retrieval practice is not done very
[00:06:04] well it's not going to be as effective
[00:06:07] as it could be but as a fundamental
[00:06:09] principle you should be spacing
[00:06:11] retrieval sessions and therefore uh very
[00:06:14] very solid advice I think as as a
[00:06:18] general principle I'm going to give it
[00:06:19] an S I think the reason that most people
[00:06:24] won't get the full benefit from it it's
[00:06:25] not because they don't understand space
[00:06:27] repetition but it's because the rate
[00:06:30] that they're forgetting information is
[00:06:31] so fast that you have to basically be
[00:06:35] repeating things like every couple days
[00:06:37] otherwise you're forgetting so much so
[00:06:39] quickly that the next time you do it
[00:06:41] you're just like overwhelmed but that's
[00:06:43] not because the space repetition was a
[00:06:45] problem is because of the method we use
[00:06:47] during the
[00:06:49] session which is like a whole other you
[00:06:51] know topic next one is a findan
[00:06:53] technique or it's otherwise just called
[00:06:55] like self teing or like
[00:06:58] self-explanation refinment technique is
[00:07:00] a very very good method because it's
[00:07:03] easy to learn it's uh it's it's creating
[00:07:06] a lot of free recall opportunities it's
[00:07:09] also creating retrieval opportunities at
[00:07:11] multiple different levels of learning uh
[00:07:14] it requires you to synthesize and
[00:07:16] simplify and evaluate the quality of
[00:07:18] your learning so it's good for Gap
[00:07:20] finding and it's it's generally more
[00:07:22] time efficient and that you're going to
[00:07:23] find more gaps that are more high yield
[00:07:27] that are at different levels than you
[00:07:29] would with brain dumps or blurting so
[00:07:33] I'm going to give fan technique probably
[00:07:35] in the a category if people are using
[00:07:37] the findan technique generally speaking
[00:07:39] their Learning System tends to be
[00:07:42] reasonably decent next one is active
[00:07:45] recall again uh one of the things that I
[00:07:48] regret actually about you know one of
[00:07:50] the earlier videos that has now received
[00:07:52] over a million views by the way thank
[00:07:53] you uh is that I really um I hated on
[00:07:57] flash cards because of the you know
[00:07:58] space repetition active recall the
[00:08:00] problem with the pair um but really it's
[00:08:02] not the issue with active recall active
[00:08:04] recall in itself is not problematic
[00:08:07] active recall just is is anything that
[00:08:10] you do that causes you to recall
[00:08:12] information from your memory usually
[00:08:14] without queuing and that's good like you
[00:08:17] should really always try to do active
[00:08:19] recall if you can and there are lots of
[00:08:21] ways you can do this like you can do
[00:08:22] microactive recall like during a single
[00:08:25] study session you can be you know
[00:08:27] reading something covering it and then
[00:08:29] immediately just trying to synthesize
[00:08:31] and generate from memory without
[00:08:32] constantly referring to the resources
[00:08:35] that would be like active recall where
[00:08:37] the the spacing interval is only like
[00:08:39] seconds even and then of course there's
[00:08:41] like the more common ways of doing
[00:08:42] active recall which is like a day or a
[00:08:44] couple days or a week or a month later
[00:08:47] active recall as a principle in itself
[00:08:51] just like spaced repetition is
[00:08:53] incredibly effective and the way that
[00:08:55] most people use active recoil is mostly
[00:08:58] limited by by the fact that they don't
[00:09:00] know which techniques are the most
[00:09:02] effective to use for it but as long as
[00:09:05] you're recalling something from memory
[00:09:07] it tends to be pretty good I'm actually
[00:09:08] going to give this an
[00:09:10] A and it can really easily be bumped up
[00:09:12] to an S and I'll explain why later okay
[00:09:16] sleep looks straight
[00:09:17] away sleep's going to be S right sleep
[00:09:20] the the S stands for sleep it's sleep
[00:09:23] tier and the reason is because sleep is
[00:09:26] one of the most important things for
[00:09:28] learning
[00:09:30] sleep triggers something called Sleep
[00:09:31] dependent memory consolidation which is
[00:09:34] basically short-term memory that is in
[00:09:36] an inaccessible part of your brain being
[00:09:39] shunted over and then properly encoded
[00:09:41] into your long-term memory so if you do
[00:09:44] an all nighter the night before an exam
[00:09:47] you're not likely to be able to perform
[00:09:49] well in that exam number one because
[00:09:50] you're going to be sleep deprived uh
[00:09:52] which I think there are some studies and
[00:09:54] I'm not 100% sure about this but I think
[00:09:56] there are some studies that have shown
[00:09:57] that when you're sleep deprived your IQ
[00:09:59] points dropped by like 10 or 20 points
[00:10:02] or something like that uh if you know
[00:10:04] the actual statistic on this leave a
[00:10:06] comment let me know um but the effect
[00:10:09] that lack of sleep has on your cognitive
[00:10:12] performance is insane like you literally
[00:10:15] getting dumber and that's not what you
[00:10:17] want when you're setting an exam but
[00:10:19] apart from that also because you didn't
[00:10:21] consolidate your memory it means that
[00:10:23] the stuff that you studied over the last
[00:10:25] like few weeks of cramming they haven't
[00:10:27] been properly stored in a way that you
[00:10:28] can actually use that information and so
[00:10:32] like it it you just start crashing on
[00:10:34] all fronts I think once you start
[00:10:35] sacrificing sleep you are
[00:10:38] sacrificing like everything it's a last
[00:10:41] resort you should never really sacrifice
[00:10:43] sleep so definitely s tier super
[00:10:46] underrated as well summary Pages the
[00:10:49] idea behind summary pages is that you
[00:10:52] basically just take like a a longer set
[00:10:54] of notes and then you summarize them
[00:10:56] down into like really about as concise
[00:10:58] as you can can get it again summary
[00:11:00] pages is one of those techniques that is
[00:11:02] generally pretty effective um and you
[00:11:06] can't really do it that wrong there are
[00:11:10] many things that you can do that would
[00:11:11] be more effective and there are many
[00:11:13] ways that you can make summary Pages
[00:11:15] more effective the way that I normally
[00:11:17] see people using summary pages is like
[00:11:21] literally just condensing what they
[00:11:23] already have and like just like making
[00:11:26] it more concise but it's in the same
[00:11:28] format and and often in the same order
[00:11:30] which creates a lot of restrictions I
[00:11:33] will say that summary Pages I'm going to
[00:11:36] put
[00:11:38] this either B or
[00:11:41] C I'm going to put it
[00:11:46] at I'm going to put at C I'm going to
[00:11:48] put it at C uh I think it's about as
[00:11:51] effective as doing brain dumps and
[00:11:53] actually a lot of the time people are
[00:11:55] just creating summary Pages as part of
[00:11:57] like a blurting or brain dump activity
[00:11:59] so can be effective and again that's
[00:12:01] another one that could really shoot up
[00:12:02] if you were to do it better and some of
[00:12:04] you are probably doing them a little bit
[00:12:06] better anyway the next thing watching
[00:12:08] videos and lectures so again you know
[00:12:10] it's pretty broad but it's like not just
[00:12:12] watching something but like watching
[00:12:13] something and like re-watching it or
[00:12:15] like re-watching U like a lecture
[00:12:17] recording um just the idea of like
[00:12:20] consuming and taking in that information
[00:12:23] honestly even though obviously like you
[00:12:26] need to get the information to do
[00:12:28] anything with it so it's like a
[00:12:29] prerequisite of learning and as a
[00:12:33] technique it's really very low yield and
[00:12:36] the way that I see people use like
[00:12:40] lectures um and and videos and learning
[00:12:43] from any like auditory Source I just
[00:12:46] don't think a lot of people have good
[00:12:48] training around how to really make that
[00:12:50] work uh so I I actually think that
[00:12:52] that's probably a d like there are a lot
[00:12:53] of people that will be better off
[00:12:56] watching and re-watching lists and they
[00:12:59] would probably do better from it next up
[00:13:02] is pneumonics pneumonics really just
[00:13:04] mean any type of memory aid technically
[00:13:07] speaking but the way that most people
[00:13:08] use pneumonics is like an acronym or
[00:13:11] some kind of saying so for example like
[00:13:14] when I was studying medicine one of the
[00:13:16] pneumonics well there's lots of
[00:13:17] different pneumonics that we use but
[00:13:18] like one of the pneumonics would be like
[00:13:20] the surgical Civ which is like vitamin C
[00:13:23] D and and it's like a checklist of
[00:13:24] different things to ask a patient
[00:13:26] questions about like is the problem V
[00:13:29] man I haven't thought about this in like
[00:13:30] years so let's see if I can still
[00:13:31] remember it like is the problem vascular
[00:13:36] esic T
[00:13:39] traumatic maybe a
[00:13:43] for and this is why I'm not a doctor
[00:13:46] anymore look it's been four years since
[00:13:48] I've had to think about this um but I
[00:13:50] remember when I knew it it was kind of
[00:13:53] helpful and there are different
[00:13:55] pneumonics that can be helpful I think
[00:13:57] the way that people tend to to use
[00:13:59] pneumonics is not really great I'm going
[00:14:01] to give it a
[00:14:03] b um and it can be really powerful again
[00:14:06] I'll talk about how we can upgrade that
[00:14:07] it's pretty
[00:14:08] simple next one listening to music okay
[00:14:12] uh listening to music like really
[00:14:13] depends on the type of music you listen
[00:14:16] to but also depending on the type of
[00:14:17] thinking you're doing while you're
[00:14:19] listening to that music and I've read
[00:14:20] through I'd say a fair amount of
[00:14:23] research on the effect of listening to
[00:14:25] music and it's still pretty like like
[00:14:27] kind of ambiguous
[00:14:29] um you might be surprised to realize
[00:14:31] that generally speaking it doesn't seem
[00:14:34] to have any real beneficial impact like
[00:14:37] more often than not listening to music
[00:14:39] of any kind tends to produce worse
[00:14:43] performance and there are some
[00:14:44] individuals that are exceptions but when
[00:14:45] you look at studies across like a wide
[00:14:47] group of people it doesn't tend to
[00:14:49] consistently make people better in fact
[00:14:52] again it makes people worse more often
[00:14:55] so I'm probably going to give this
[00:14:57] actually a d because I think a lot of
[00:15:00] people really love listening to music
[00:15:02] when they study because they think it's
[00:15:04] helping them but actually it's probably
[00:15:06] not and and I'll explain the reason why
[00:15:07] you probably think it's helping even
[00:15:09] when it's not uh in a moment okay the
[00:15:12] next one is Cornell note taking if
[00:15:15] you're not familiar with cornal note
[00:15:16] taking it's basically just like a
[00:15:16] templated sheet of how to take notes
[00:15:18] where involves like writing your notes
[00:15:20] on one side writing some keywords on the
[00:15:21] other and then creating like a summary
[00:15:22] at the bottom it's almost like a
[00:15:25] combination of like creating summary
[00:15:27] pages
[00:15:29] and to a certain level like a like a
[00:15:31] findan technique esque feel to it on a
[00:15:35] single piece of paper I give Cornell
[00:15:37] note taking a like a thumbs up for the
[00:15:40] fact that it was a very early popular
[00:15:43] method of note taking that got people to
[00:15:44] start thinking about how they can write
[00:15:46] notes in a more strategic way there's
[00:15:49] really no way that you can do cor out
[00:15:51] note taking wrong because it's just very
[00:15:53] easy to do um but like many techniques
[00:15:56] that are just straight up easy to do
[00:15:59] it's like there's limited benefits it's
[00:16:02] probably at the same level as I'd say a
[00:16:05] summary
[00:16:07] page actually I'm going to give it a b
[00:16:09] tier I'm going to give it higher than
[00:16:10] summary pages and the reason is because
[00:16:12] when you use cor out not taking it makes
[00:16:15] you think about being more concise
[00:16:18] during the learning event itself like
[00:16:21] it's not I'm just going to write all the
[00:16:22] stuff down and then come back to it like
[00:16:24] 3 days later and then try to create a
[00:16:25] summary page out of it you're forced to
[00:16:27] summarize and synthesize and condense
[00:16:29] immediately and that makes a big
[00:16:31] difference to your your processing power
[00:16:34] uh so for that reason I'm going to give
[00:16:35] it higher than summary pages okay mind
[00:16:38] maps you probably know if you're
[00:16:41] watching this video and you got caught
[00:16:42] by the algorithm for the first time in
[00:16:43] which case welcome you probably know
[00:16:46] that mind maps are like I'm a big
[00:16:47] proponent of doing mind maps but I also
[00:16:50] have talked about multiple times how the
[00:16:52] way most people use mind Maps is really
[00:16:56] ineffective like it's barely any better
[00:16:59] and sometimes just worse than writing
[00:17:01] straight up linear notes
[00:17:04] so I will
[00:17:07] painfully probably actually give my
[00:17:12] maps a c like it really is not helping
[00:17:17] most people that are mind mathing and I
[00:17:19] and it's most it's actually completely
[00:17:22] because the point of how to do mind maps
[00:17:25] in the right way is missed because it's
[00:17:27] it's not just about doing it like you
[00:17:30] can create as many mind maps as you want
[00:17:32] but if the way that you're creating them
[00:17:34] is not in a certain way then you will
[00:17:37] find that is very very ineffective and
[00:17:39] just timec consuming and messy and like
[00:17:42] honestly completely pointless like you
[00:17:44] would it would be 100% better just to
[00:17:47] create like a set of notion notes or
[00:17:49] like a zetoc Casten type thing instead
[00:17:52] of doing my maps and an incorrect
[00:17:53] technique the power only comes through
[00:17:56] where it becomes way better than all
[00:17:58] those other techniques when you learn to
[00:17:59] do it the right
[00:18:00] way and the final one lucky last uh
[00:18:04] rereading and highlighting I mean this
[00:18:07] just plainly sucks like it's just
[00:18:11] terrible I I don't know what else to say
[00:18:12] about this like this there so little
[00:18:15] benefit from doing this and it it's it's
[00:18:19] so hard to make it work in a way that's
[00:18:22] not worse for you so that's a d if there
[00:18:25] was an e it would be an e
[00:18:29] so that's the tier list part one all
[00:18:33] right so that was part one based on the
[00:18:34] way that people normally use these
[00:18:36] techniques and in part two I'm going to
[00:18:38] go through how we can modify it and
[00:18:40] upgrade them so that we can make them
[00:18:41] even better if you like this format let
[00:18:43] me know in the comments and if there's
[00:18:44] any techniques that you want me to go
[00:18:45] over then also let me know as well but
[00:18:48] otherwise thank you for watching and
[00:18:49] I'll see you in part
[00:18:57] two


=== How effective is Cornell note-taking? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdsGkqFIr0M

[00:00:00] Cornell note taking it's basically just
[00:00:01] like a templated sheet of how to take
[00:00:03] notes inves like writing your notes on
[00:00:04] one side writing some keywords on the
[00:00:06] other and then creating like a summary
[00:00:07] at the bottom it's almost like a
[00:00:09] combination of creating summary pages
[00:00:12] and to a certain level like a findan
[00:00:14] technique on a single piece of paper I
[00:00:17] give Cornell note taking like a thumbs
[00:00:18] up for the fact that it was a very early
[00:00:21] popular method of note taking that got
[00:00:23] people to start thinking about how they
[00:00:24] can write notes in a more strategic way
[00:00:26] there's really no way that you can do
[00:00:27] cor out note taking wrong because it's
[00:00:29] just very easy to do but like many
[00:00:31] techniques that are just straight up
[00:00:33] easy to do there's limited benefits when
[00:00:35] you use cor out not taking it makes you
[00:00:38] think about being more concise during
[00:00:40] the learning event itself like it's not
[00:00:43] I'm just going to write all the stuff
[00:00:44] down and then come back to it 3 days
[00:00:45] later and then try to create a summary
[00:00:47] page out of it you're forced to
[00:00:48] summarize and synthesize and condense
[00:00:50] immediately and that makes a big
[00:00:51] difference to your processing power


=== What REALLY happens at Medical School ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF6d6dixqaQ

[00:00:00] in the first 2 weeks of biomed first
[00:00:02] year university for just one of the four
[00:00:04] papers it was roughly the entirety of
[00:00:06] year 13 biology so it's a crazy pce and
[00:00:08] crazy volume but as a result I
[00:00:10] compensated by being equally crazy so I
[00:00:12] studied 15 to 20 hours a day 7 days a
[00:00:14] week for nine consecutive months I was
[00:00:16] extremely sleep deprived I was literally
[00:00:18] hallucinating we can talk about that
[00:00:20] another time but very distressful
[00:00:21] physically emotionally mentally like all
[00:00:24] of it just not good I talk about it with
[00:00:26] a smile now but no it was really not not
[00:00:27] a good time I did do well though and I
[00:00:29] was accept Ed into Medical School
[00:00:31] eventually great so I won but I didn't
[00:00:33] because when I entered into medical
[00:00:34] school I realized that the content is
[00:00:36] around 2 to three times premid and then
[00:00:38] I wasn't majoring in math but I thought
[00:00:40] I can't study 15 to 40 hours a day


=== Ranking study techniques: Pre-Study ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Kwf0NmdsYA

[00:00:00] pre-study is a pretty common kind of
[00:00:02] method that people will use it's it's
[00:00:03] basically just talking about studying
[00:00:05] something before learning it and what I
[00:00:07] call a main learning event which is
[00:00:09] basically a lecture or maybe an
[00:00:10] intensive study session the time where
[00:00:12] you're thinking this is the first time
[00:00:14] I'm seriously going to sit down to
[00:00:16] properly study it that would be the main
[00:00:17] learning event a pre-study is just any
[00:00:20] type of study that you do before that I
[00:00:22] would say that the way that most people
[00:00:24] do it can be of mixed Effectiveness and
[00:00:27] I'm going to give that a b pretty decent
[00:00:30] but this is definitely one that can
[00:00:32] really get better with a few
[00:00:33] modifications


=== Working hard isn't as impressive as you think ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CniqSdqUchE

[00:00:00] work smarter before working harder don't
[00:00:02] do it the other way around this is
[00:00:04] important because number one you can
[00:00:05] only try so hard there's only so many
[00:00:06] hours a day and there's only so much you
[00:00:08] can work before you like burn out and
[00:00:10] deplete yourself and hard work is not
[00:00:11] actually very unique when you're at the
[00:00:13] top if you're aiming for something that
[00:00:15] is very exclusive like a top level type
[00:00:17] of result everyone there is working hard
[00:00:18] like I said I travel the world and I do
[00:00:20] these workshops and I say how many of
[00:00:21] you are wanting to get like a certain
[00:00:22] type of grade or get into a certain type
[00:00:24] of degree that's really competitive you
[00:00:25] know like 99% of the room is putting
[00:00:27] their hands up and I say okay well put
[00:00:28] your hand down if you're not willing to
[00:00:30] work really hard no one puts their hands
[00:00:31] down everyone's willing to work hard so
[00:00:33] in the general population yes hard work
[00:00:35] really separates you from the crowd but
[00:00:37] it's not enough to get really in that
[00:00:39] top percentage if that's what you're
[00:00:41] aiming for and working smarter also
[00:00:42] takes a Time investment it takes time to
[00:00:45] learn how to work smarter but if all of
[00:00:47] your time is filled with working harder
[00:00:49] you do not have time to learn how to
[00:00:51] work smarter and year by year challenges
[00:00:53] get more difficult which means that you
[00:00:55] are becoming less and less prepared


=== Don't make this mistake with your side hustle ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-tGIYAZdo4

[00:00:00] there's no quick answer in terms of how
[00:00:01] to set up an an alternative income
[00:00:03] stream but there's a few I think like
[00:00:04] principles that should be followed like
[00:00:05] number one you're going to have to have
[00:00:07] multiple attempts number two you want
[00:00:08] something that is not sort of draining
[00:00:11] you from an enjoyment and fulfillment
[00:00:13] point of view you do want to be picking
[00:00:14] something that you find intrinsic
[00:00:16] motivation to do something that you feel
[00:00:18] drawn towards because a lot of the
[00:00:20] people when I was going through and when
[00:00:21] I was working as a doctor often people
[00:00:23] would say like Justin how you how are
[00:00:24] you managing all the things that you're
[00:00:25] doing but I never really felt it was as
[00:00:27] tiring and as dramatic as it might seem
[00:00:29] on paper because doing these other
[00:00:30] things is actually what energized and
[00:00:32] like kind of rejuvenated me to to go
[00:00:33] into the grind of of medicine you know
[00:00:35] so picking something like that is going
[00:00:36] to be really important


=== This note-taking technique will save you TIME ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PXWK_cnp8

[00:00:00] once you can start writing notes
[00:00:01] nonlinearly even though it technically
[00:00:03] takes longer to write your notes down
[00:00:07] like literally because you actually have
[00:00:08] to think about it as you write you're
[00:00:10] saving time massively overall because a
[00:00:14] you're actually having to write less B
[00:00:17] you're actually forgetting less C you're
[00:00:20] understanding it more deeply so you
[00:00:21] don't have to do as many repetitions to
[00:00:23] try to get to that depth which is better
[00:00:26] for your confidence and anxiety D we're
[00:00:28] actually finding knowledge gaps
[00:00:30] potentially weeks earlier and E because
[00:00:32] it's helping us develop these knowledge
[00:00:34] networks it means that future content is
[00:00:36] faster and easier to learn because we
[00:00:39] have existing networks to build off


=== Working hard doesn't make you special ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMfDLU2X2LQ

[00:00:00] hard work is about doing the work that
[00:00:02] puts you through the fear Zone it's not
[00:00:04] about just staying in the comfort zone
[00:00:05] and doing more hours and doing more of
[00:00:07] the same thing if every year brings new
[00:00:09] challenges if you stay the same you're
[00:00:11] actually getting worse you're getting
[00:00:12] less prepared if you stay in your
[00:00:14] comfort zone so hard work is not just
[00:00:16] I'm going to study more hours I'm going
[00:00:17] to wake up earlier I'm going to put in
[00:00:18] you know more time than other people if
[00:00:19] you're willing to do that great
[00:00:21] fantastic that's a great attribute to
[00:00:22] have but again hard work has a limit and
[00:00:24] you want to use that time and energy to
[00:00:26] learn how to work smarter first instead


=== The TRUTH about learning preferences ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYUJgtEHViQ

[00:00:00] most people that have gone through
[00:00:01] formal education have a learning
[00:00:03] preference that's a combination of
[00:00:05] visual and reading and writing and a lot
[00:00:08] of that is just because of habits and
[00:00:10] prior experience it's important to
[00:00:12] realize that your learning preferences
[00:00:14] are often not based on what is most
[00:00:16] effective for you but it's going to be a
[00:00:18] combination of what is effective and
[00:00:20] what are you used to and the things that
[00:00:23] you're used to are not necessarily
[00:00:25] effective if that were the case then the
[00:00:27] pathway to becoming the most efficient
[00:00:28] learner would be to continous ly just do
[00:00:30] the thing that you are the most
[00:00:31] comfortable with which is in fact what
[00:00:33] most people do and that's also the
[00:00:35] reason why most people struggle


=== Why students are quitting medical school? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1de8fyBw0gA

[00:00:00] I don't think it is a good idea to leave
[00:00:02] medicine without already having
[00:00:04] established an income stream that is
[00:00:06] bringing positive cash flow in how did
[00:00:08] you do all that while you were working
[00:00:10] full-time so if you're a medical student
[00:00:12] you've got more time okay what's really
[00:00:14] interesting right is that because the
[00:00:16] program that I run is teaching people to
[00:00:17] learn more efficiently right and like up
[00:00:18] skill and things I've got a lot of
[00:00:19] medical students in it because they're
[00:00:20] coming in because they want to learn how
[00:00:21] to learn for their academic studies but
[00:00:23] now they're equipped with these skills
[00:00:24] that allow them to upskill and learn
[00:00:26] much more efficiently and now they've
[00:00:27] got more free time and they now have
[00:00:28] like the sense of confidence of being to
[00:00:30] learn anything yeah so a lot of them
[00:00:32] have started because of that
[00:00:33] re-evaluating medicine as an option
[00:00:36] which is which is what have you done
[00:00:37] Justin which is you already have like a
[00:00:39] doctor shortage what have you done well
[00:00:41] hey maybe the reason we've got a doctor
[00:00:42] shortage is because there's an issue
[00:00:44] with Doctor retention I thought that's
[00:00:45] quite interesting is like this door has
[00:00:46] open to them because they no longer feel
[00:00:48] in a way like trapped to go down this
[00:00:50] pathway


=== Why learning styles aren't practical ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b7TlGsFkBQ

[00:00:00] most of the time we don't have a choice
[00:00:01] on the type of learning style we have
[00:00:04] available to us like if someone is only
[00:00:07] teaching something to you like by
[00:00:09] speaking it you have to be able to learn
[00:00:12] auditorally not only is it cognitively
[00:00:15] more beneficial to use multiple
[00:00:17] different styles to generate learning
[00:00:19] but we don't even have a choice like you
[00:00:21] have to learn that skill anyway
[00:00:23] otherwise you're just going to be this
[00:00:24] person that's like sitting there in
[00:00:25] class the lecturer is telling you about
[00:00:27] stuff and you're just like oh I just
[00:00:29] can't learn auditorally like it just
[00:00:30] doesn't work for me so you can see the
[00:00:32] options are pretty limited if you are
[00:00:34] committing to learning styles


=== Learning styles ≠ Personalised learning ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSnaNnt3k_U

[00:00:00] learning styles are not the bane of the
[00:00:02] learning World there is a useful and
[00:00:06] effective way of thinking about learning
[00:00:08] styles that is genuinely very helpful
[00:00:10] and beneficial the thing about
[00:00:12] completely rejecting learning styles is
[00:00:14] that it doesn't acknowledge the parts of
[00:00:17] learning styles that are true everyone
[00:00:21] does have a personalized way of learning
[00:00:25] everyone has a method of learning that
[00:00:27] they have to figure out and build over
[00:00:29] time and if everyone has learning
[00:00:31] preferences if we say learning styles do
[00:00:33] not exist then it's like oh well so does
[00:00:35] that mean that everyone learns the same
[00:00:37] way no personalized learning and
[00:00:40] personalized learning systems do exist
[00:00:42] however we have to separate that from
[00:00:44] learning styles which is kind of the
[00:00:46] idea that biologically our brain has to
[00:00:49] learn in a certain style for it to be
[00:00:51] effective


=== How do I quit being a Doctor? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_SDnk1ynNM

[00:00:00] one of the things that I'm afraid of
[00:00:02] leaving medicine is you know Financial
[00:00:04] Security so what did you do to be able
[00:00:05] to do that okay so you have to
[00:00:07] understand what your expenses are and
[00:00:09] how much you actually need and in my
[00:00:11] experience uh doctors are not actually
[00:00:13] very financially not very financially
[00:00:16] financially lit at all cuz you come in
[00:00:18] you've got a good enough salary that you
[00:00:19] don't have to really worry too much
[00:00:21] about the details but start worrying
[00:00:22] about the details actually track your
[00:00:24] finances know what is going out what is
[00:00:26] coming in go through a period of really
[00:00:28] assessing your expenses and seeing you
[00:00:29] know is this necessary or not and I'm
[00:00:31] I'm not saying be like Spartan about
[00:00:32] your lifestyle but just think do you
[00:00:34] really need to you need this can you
[00:00:35] mitigate certain things are there
[00:00:36] subscriptions that you're not really
[00:00:37] using that you can cancel whatever it is
[00:00:38] you know and figure out what is the real
[00:00:40] number that you need to maintain the
[00:00:42] lifestyle that you have or to have the
[00:00:44] lifestyle that you you want and figure
[00:00:45] out what that number is um and that that
[00:00:47] number is often pretty small if you're
[00:00:49] junior if you don't have like a mortgage
[00:00:51] or what if your expenses are not super
[00:00:52] high then it's much easier obviously to
[00:00:54] transition


=== Why your Learning Style makes you WORSE ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xJupIiiBhc

[00:00:00] if you believe that everyone has a
[00:00:01] unique learning style some people are
[00:00:03] visual some people are auditory then you
[00:00:06] would be just a normal person but you'd
[00:00:09] also be wrong it's what we call a neurom
[00:00:11] myth which is a belief about the brain
[00:00:13] which is just not true and it's one of
[00:00:15] the most widely believed neurom myths
[00:00:18] and it's one of the most widely refuted
[00:00:20] and that a lot of people know that it's
[00:00:22] wrong but if you believe that learning
[00:00:26] styles are not relevant for you you also
[00:00:30] kind of be wrong in this video I'm going
[00:00:32] to talk about what learning styles are
[00:00:34] what are the problems and the research
[00:00:35] around learning styles and also why the
[00:00:38] way that most people just reject it is a
[00:00:42] little premature there are some really
[00:00:44] useful ways that you can think about
[00:00:45] learning styles that would actually help
[00:00:47] you to improve so whether you believe in
[00:00:49] learning styles or you don't I think
[00:00:50] this video is going to help you to be a
[00:00:51] more efficient learner if you're new to
[00:00:52] this Channel and you're wondering what I
[00:00:54] know about learning and who I am I'm Dr
[00:00:56] Justin Sun I'm a learning coach and the
[00:00:57] head of learning at I can study I'm also
[00:00:59] a former Medical doctor for the last
[00:01:00] decade I've helped thousands of Learners
[00:01:02] from all around the world to become more
[00:01:03] efficient Learners my work puts me in a
[00:01:05] really interesting space because I get
[00:01:06] to spend a lot of time reading the
[00:01:07] research and then spend a lot of time
[00:01:09] practicing it and coaching it to people
[00:01:11] and seeing how effective it really is
[00:01:13] and in a recent video I talked about
[00:01:14] learner types and how understanding your
[00:01:16] learner type can really help you to
[00:01:17] improve very quickly and I made a
[00:01:18] distinction that this is not the same as
[00:01:20] learning styles a lot of you said that
[00:01:23] you wanted me to make a more in-depth
[00:01:25] video about learning styles and the
[00:01:27] problems with them and so here it is
[00:01:29] before we get started I'd really
[00:01:30] appreciate if you give this video a like
[00:01:32] for the algorithm the algorithm dictates
[00:01:34] how many people this video will reach
[00:01:36] and it also apparently dictates how well
[00:01:38] I sleep at night so first of all what is
[00:01:40] the concept of learning styles learning
[00:01:41] styles is this concept that individuals
[00:01:44] have unique styles of learning that
[00:01:46] they're better at for example if you're
[00:01:48] a visual learner then you're better at
[00:01:50] learning through images and diagrams and
[00:01:53] and pictures and if you're an auditory
[00:01:54] learner you're better at learning
[00:01:56] through listening or speaking if you're
[00:01:58] a read and write learner then you're
[00:02:00] better at learning through reading and
[00:02:02] writing it's kind of in the name if
[00:02:04] you're a kinesthetic learner then you're
[00:02:05] better at learning through
[00:02:06] experimentation and getting your hands
[00:02:08] dirty with it and there are actually
[00:02:09] lots of other different ways of
[00:02:11] classifying learning styles which has
[00:02:13] happened over the years but the most
[00:02:15] common one is this one called V or vac
[00:02:18] which stands for visual auditory read
[00:02:19] and write cantic and so the idea is that
[00:02:22] if you are a teacher then you should
[00:02:23] figure out the learning style of your
[00:02:24] student and therefore teach to that
[00:02:26] learning style and likewise if you're a
[00:02:27] learner you should figure out your own
[00:02:29] learning style and learn to learn in
[00:02:31] that style which is going to be more
[00:02:33] efficient for you and it's a widely
[00:02:34] believed actually almost like intuitive
[00:02:37] understanding about how the brain works
[00:02:38] there are some studies that say that
[00:02:39] over 90% of teachers will believe this
[00:02:42] but the problem is that it's just not
[00:02:44] true learning styles is actually this
[00:02:47] concept that came around in the' 70s
[00:02:50] which was not really based on any real
[00:02:53] research it was just kind of a theory
[00:02:55] that someone just pulled out of a hat
[00:02:57] one day and they were like I feel feel
[00:03:00] like this is how the brain learns and
[00:03:03] back in the' 70s like we didn't really
[00:03:05] have high standards for Journal article
[00:03:08] and Publications like there's some crazy
[00:03:09] stuff if you look at the older journals
[00:03:11] but around the' 70s that's also when we
[00:03:13] had this huge self-esteem movement like
[00:03:16] everyone is special everyone's like
[00:03:17] their own special Snowflake and so
[00:03:20] therefore learning styles sort of fit in
[00:03:22] with that like yes I am a unique special
[00:03:25] human being and therefore I must have a
[00:03:27] unique special way of learning as well
[00:03:29] and so fast forward like 50 years it is
[00:03:32] now one of the most deeply ingrained
[00:03:35] myths about learning that we tend to
[00:03:37] believe and I guess fake news likes
[00:03:39] company because it sits alongside other
[00:03:41] neurom myths like we only use 10% of our
[00:03:44] brain or that some people are left
[00:03:47] brained or right brained both of those
[00:03:49] things are also myths and so in the case
[00:03:51] of learning styles it's really being
[00:03:52] researched quite a lot now over the last
[00:03:55] few decades the case has sort of been
[00:03:57] put to rest we have a substantial amount
[00:03:59] of of research that shows that people do
[00:04:01] not have like a single unique learning
[00:04:03] style that they are better at
[00:04:05] essentially every human being is a
[00:04:07] stronger visual processor than anything
[00:04:10] else and even if you are technically a
[00:04:12] auditory learner style based on some
[00:04:14] quiz which by the way like that quiz is
[00:04:17] created by a for-profit company that
[00:04:18] creates royalties on people doing that
[00:04:20] quiz by the way even if you were an
[00:04:23] auditory style learner what studies show
[00:04:25] is that you're still like thousands of
[00:04:27] times faster processing visual
[00:04:29] information cuz that's just how the
[00:04:30] human brain works and also regardless of
[00:04:33] your learning style everyone performs
[00:04:35] better when they use a mix of styles and
[00:04:38] actually what seems to make more of a
[00:04:39] difference is trying to match the
[00:04:41] learning style you use for the type of
[00:04:44] information that you're learning rather
[00:04:46] than saying I can only learn in a
[00:04:48] certain way and this is really just to
[00:04:49] say that the methods that you use should
[00:04:52] change depending on the topic that
[00:04:54] you're learning which seems relatively
[00:04:56] self-explanatory most people don't study
[00:04:58] maths or engineering the same way they
[00:05:00] study Spanish and history or maybe you
[00:05:03] do and your only technique is that you
[00:05:05] use flash cards endlessly and if that's
[00:05:06] the case then there is other problems
[00:05:08] that we need to talk about but at the
[00:05:10] end of the day the question is kind of
[00:05:11] like who cares why does it actually
[00:05:13] matter if learning styles are real or
[00:05:14] not well there are actually some serious
[00:05:16] problems that this causes and as a
[00:05:18] learning coach I see the consequences of
[00:05:21] this every day one of the major problems
[00:05:23] is ironically When You Believe in
[00:05:25] learning styles then it stops you from
[00:05:27] becoming a better learner I've have had
[00:05:29] so many people come up to me of all ages
[00:05:32] like high school University you know PhD
[00:05:35] working professionals entrepreneurs come
[00:05:38] up to me and say that they've got
[00:05:39] problems with their learning which
[00:05:40] fundamentally stem from believing in
[00:05:43] learning styles because if you
[00:05:44] fundamentally believe that the only way
[00:05:46] to build a house effectively is to use
[00:05:49] the one tool that is uniquely efficient
[00:05:53] for you then you're going to run at the
[00:05:55] problems building that house believing
[00:05:57] in learning styles create this
[00:05:59] artificial limit on how you think your
[00:06:03] brain has to learn and this is something
[00:06:05] that in the research people call pigeon
[00:06:07] H holding it means that you create this
[00:06:08] little box for yourself and you live
[00:06:10] inside that little box and that is just
[00:06:13] not going to be conducive to success
[00:06:15] every learner needs to be able to use
[00:06:16] multiple different methods multiple
[00:06:18] different tools operate with multiple
[00:06:20] different styles depending on the
[00:06:21] information type depending on the
[00:06:22] resource type that's available and they
[00:06:24] need to be a to synthesize and construct
[00:06:27] good learning out of that most of the
[00:06:29] time we don't have a choice on the type
[00:06:31] of learning style we have available to
[00:06:33] us like if someone is only teaching
[00:06:36] something to you like by speaking it you
[00:06:39] have to be able to learn auditorily and
[00:06:42] also if you love audio books but you're
[00:06:44] just not a auditory learner then what
[00:06:46] does that mean you can never learn from
[00:06:47] an audio book not only is it cognitively
[00:06:50] more beneficial to use multiple
[00:06:52] different styles to generate learning
[00:06:54] but we don't even have a choice like you
[00:06:56] have to learn that skill anyway
[00:06:58] otherwise you're just going to be this
[00:06:59] person that's like sitting there in
[00:07:01] class the lecturer is telling you about
[00:07:02] stuff and you're just like oh I just
[00:07:04] can't learn auditorily like it just
[00:07:05] doesn't work for me and then later on in
[00:07:07] the workforce your boss is going to give
[00:07:08] you some instructions and you're going
[00:07:09] to be like oh wait I'm a visual learner
[00:07:11] can you make a flow diagram for that
[00:07:14] like someone's trying to teach you how
[00:07:15] to play basketball one day and you're
[00:07:16] like I just need a VIN diagram like I
[00:07:18] just can't understand it so you can see
[00:07:20] the options are pretty limited if you
[00:07:22] are committing to learning styles and by
[00:07:24] the way on the other side of this like
[00:07:25] for teachers it's really detrimental as
[00:07:27] well because it adds a lot more work and
[00:07:29] a lot more pressure and burden for
[00:07:31] teachers to try to deliver like this
[00:07:33] perfect education and perfect lesson
[00:07:36] that's suited for every person's unique
[00:07:39] learning style and then if the student
[00:07:41] is not performing it's like oh it's a
[00:07:42] teacher's fault cuz I didn't teach it
[00:07:43] properly they didn't match my learning
[00:07:45] style and so there's really a lot of
[00:07:47] problems with believing in learning
[00:07:48] styles and it's especially sad because a
[00:07:50] lot of people and even teachers when
[00:07:52] they think about the pride they take on
[00:07:55] how they've personalized something like
[00:07:57] I've personalized my learning style or
[00:07:58] I've personalized the way that I teach
[00:08:00] my students usually the thing that they
[00:08:02] have tried to optimize is learning
[00:08:04] styles but learning styles are not the
[00:08:07] bane of the learning World there is a
[00:08:11] useful and effective way of thinking
[00:08:13] about learning styles that is genuinely
[00:08:16] very helpful and beneficial what I've
[00:08:17] noticed recently is that people that
[00:08:19] know a little bit about the learning
[00:08:20] research they love to hate on learning
[00:08:23] styles like learning styles has become
[00:08:24] like the new Flat Earth of learning like
[00:08:27] you know that joke about how you can
[00:08:28] always tell someone's a vegan because
[00:08:30] they're going to tell you about it or
[00:08:31] you know someone that's Crossfit because
[00:08:33] they're going to tell you about it not
[00:08:34] that I have anything against vegans or
[00:08:36] CrossFit by the way it's kind of like
[00:08:38] that with people that know this whole
[00:08:39] thing about learning styles like they
[00:08:40] would be walking down the road and they
[00:08:42] hear someone talk about learning styles
[00:08:43] and they just slide in and they say
[00:08:45] learning styles are not real and they
[00:08:47] just fly away but I actually do think
[00:08:50] that there is a good way of thinking
[00:08:51] about learning styles the thing about
[00:08:52] completely rejecting learning styles is
[00:08:55] that it doesn't acknowledge the parts of
[00:08:58] learning style
[00:08:59] that are true everyone does have a
[00:09:03] personalized way of learning everyone
[00:09:06] has a method of learning that they have
[00:09:08] to figure out and build over time and
[00:09:10] everyone has learning preferences if we
[00:09:13] say learning styles do not exist then
[00:09:15] it's like oh well so does that mean that
[00:09:17] everyone learns the same way no
[00:09:19] personalized learning and personalized
[00:09:21] learning systems do exist however we
[00:09:23] have to separate that from learning
[00:09:25] styles which is kind of the idea that
[00:09:28] biologically our brain has to learn in a
[00:09:31] certain style for it to be effective so
[00:09:32] you might be wondering a few things like
[00:09:34] okay if you take learning styles away
[00:09:36] what does a personalized learning system
[00:09:38] actually mean what does learning
[00:09:41] preferences mean and then how do you
[00:09:43] actually build that personalized
[00:09:44] learning system and these are all very
[00:09:46] good questions that I'm going to jump
[00:09:47] into but another question that you might
[00:09:49] be having is who's this video's sponsor
[00:09:52] which is a fantastic question uh you can
[00:09:54] probably tell based on my shirt the
[00:09:57] sponsor of this video is right yeah
[00:09:59] there we go I can study which is my
[00:10:02] company like I said before I've spent
[00:10:03] the last decade learning about learning
[00:10:06] applying it myself to become a top
[00:10:07] learner and then teaching thousands of
[00:10:09] people to become top Learners as well
[00:10:11] and I've distilled down that experience
[00:10:13] into a stepbystep guided program where
[00:10:16] you can learn the easiest and smoothest
[00:10:18] way to become a more efficient learner
[00:10:21] while asking questions and getting
[00:10:22] feedback on your work and being part of
[00:10:24] a really vibrant amazingly supportive
[00:10:27] community and it is not a magic pill
[00:10:29] it's not going to solve all of your
[00:10:31] learning problems overnight it does take
[00:10:33] time it does take effort but for those
[00:10:34] of you that are serious about becoming a
[00:10:36] more efficient learner then this is the
[00:10:37] best place to start you can learn more
[00:10:39] and check it out at iid.com you can find
[00:10:40] the link in the description so with that
[00:10:42] great question answered let's move on to
[00:10:44] the other ones let's start with the idea
[00:10:46] of learning preferences most people that
[00:10:48] have gone through formal education have
[00:10:50] a learning preference that's a
[00:10:51] combination of visual and reading and
[00:10:54] writing and a lot of that is just
[00:10:56] because of habits and prior experience
[00:10:59] it's important to realize that your
[00:11:00] learning preferences are often not based
[00:11:02] on what is most effective for you but
[00:11:05] it's going to be a combination of what
[00:11:07] is effective and what are you used to
[00:11:10] and the things that you're used to are
[00:11:11] not necessarily effective if that were
[00:11:14] the case then the pathway to becoming
[00:11:15] the most efficient learner would be to
[00:11:17] continuously just do the thing that you
[00:11:18] are the most comfortable with which is
[00:11:20] in fact what most people do and that's
[00:11:23] also the reason why most people struggle
[00:11:25] everyone has preferences but actually
[00:11:27] challenging those preferences is
[00:11:29] important and the next thing is what
[00:11:31] does personalized learning look like if
[00:11:33] we take learning styles out of the
[00:11:35] equation well one of the things that I
[00:11:36] think learning styles is useful for us
[00:11:38] to give us different ways of thinking
[00:11:40] about learning and its modalities for
[00:11:42] example if you currently are mostly
[00:11:44] doing read and right style note taking
[00:11:46] then you're probably going to benefit
[00:11:48] from incorporating some visual elements
[00:11:50] in there and if there's a modality that
[00:11:51] you struggle with like a lot of people
[00:11:53] struggle to just listen and learn then
[00:11:55] you have to think well what are the
[00:11:56] methods that I can use to become better
[00:11:58] at that using learning styles as a guide
[00:12:01] to think about different methods can
[00:12:04] help us to focus our attention on
[00:12:06] addressing the weaknesses and improving
[00:12:08] our strength like I said before everyone
[00:12:09] should be a mixed mode learner but the
[00:12:12] specific mix of modes that you use for
[00:12:15] different subjects and different topics
[00:12:17] and in different parts of the learning
[00:12:19] process like when you're first encoding
[00:12:21] information for the first time versus
[00:12:22] when you're trying to practice rehearsal
[00:12:24] and retrieval these two situations might
[00:12:27] have different types of compin ations
[00:12:29] and so there is a lot of personalization
[00:12:30] that can occur in understanding which
[00:12:33] combination is more effective for you
[00:12:35] how you make certain modalities work for
[00:12:37] you and then how you adjust that overall
[00:12:40] system depending on the needs and
[00:12:42] challenges that you have the problem is
[00:12:44] that a lot of people think about
[00:12:45] personalization like they think about
[00:12:47] creativity creativity is not about
[00:12:49] creating something that is completely
[00:12:51] new and novel it's about creating a
[00:12:53] variation on something that already
[00:12:55] exists for example I don't know if you
[00:12:57] guys have seen these like Thai life
[00:13:00] insurance
[00:13:07] commercials where they tell this like
[00:13:08] really emotional story of someone's life
[00:13:12] like it's a whole movie and then at the
[00:13:14] end it's like that's why you need life
[00:13:16] insurance and personally I love those
[00:13:18] ads I think they're really creative but
[00:13:19] there's still just a variation on an
[00:13:21] established Norm you're telling a
[00:13:22] compelling story that creates relevance
[00:13:25] leading up to a point where you're then
[00:13:26] selling the product something that was
[00:13:29] literally completely new and novel would
[00:13:31] be trying to sell life insurance by
[00:13:34] dressing up as a clown and rubbing tofu
[00:13:37] on people's face on the street and
[00:13:40] screaming at them to buy life insurance
[00:13:42] like it's just totally random and I
[00:13:44] don't think it would work but you can
[00:13:46] see the same thing is true for learning
[00:13:47] like there are some fundamental pretty
[00:13:50] Universal principles about learning that
[00:13:53] everyone needs to follow as long as they
[00:13:55] have a human brain that is biologically
[00:13:58] the same as another human brain and once
[00:14:00] we understand what those patterns of
[00:14:02] thinking and those structures are we can
[00:14:04] then be personalized within those
[00:14:06] structures for example one of the things
[00:14:08] I talk a lot about is nonlinear note
[00:14:09] taking and you can check that out in the
[00:14:10] video here and there are certain
[00:14:12] principles of nonlinear note taking that
[00:14:14] are just going to make it easier and
[00:14:15] more effective for everyone but then the
[00:14:18] actual way that you execute on those
[00:14:20] principles and on those guidelines is
[00:14:22] going to be unique to you likewise one
[00:14:24] of the most critical parts of deep
[00:14:27] processing which is the type of thinking
[00:14:29] that helps you gain a deeper memory and
[00:14:31] better understanding is to be able to
[00:14:32] think in networks and relationships but
[00:14:35] the type of relationships and networks
[00:14:37] that you form and what makes sense to
[00:14:39] you that's going to depend on your prior
[00:14:41] knowledge as well as what you find
[00:14:43] relevant and that's actually going to be
[00:14:44] unique to you personalization of
[00:14:46] learning is not something that happens
[00:14:48] because you are setting out to become
[00:14:51] unique it is a natural consequence of
[00:14:54] what happens when you become more
[00:14:55] efficient with using the principles and
[00:14:58] the reason I'm emphasizing this so much
[00:15:00] is because that process of building a
[00:15:03] personalized learning system is a
[00:15:06] process unlike with learning styles
[00:15:08] which basically just says like hey
[00:15:10] here's a technique just use it great now
[00:15:12] you're an amazing learner which doesn't
[00:15:14] actually work the harsh reality is that
[00:15:18] it takes time to build an effective
[00:15:20] Learning System all the stuff that I've
[00:15:22] said just now is probably not as sexy as
[00:15:25] a quick tip around learning styles which
[00:15:27] is probably why it's not going to be as
[00:15:29] popular and mainstream but none of that
[00:15:31] changes the fact that at the end of the
[00:15:32] day if you want to be an efficient
[00:15:34] learner with the Learning System that
[00:15:36] works for you you have to go through
[00:15:39] this process of exploration Discovery
[00:15:42] trial and error experimentation and
[00:15:44] reflection and it takes time people
[00:15:46] often ask me Justin you you know put all
[00:15:48] this content out there for free aren't
[00:15:50] you afraid that if this becomes like so
[00:15:53] common that then everyone will be an
[00:15:56] efficient learner and then it's not
[00:15:57] going to be special anymore anymore I
[00:15:59] genuinely am not worried about that at
[00:16:02] all because my YouTube channel does not
[00:16:04] grow very fast but seriously because it
[00:16:07] takes time and effort like most people
[00:16:09] are looking for the shortcut and this is
[00:16:12] not a shortcut and so if you're
[00:16:13] listening to me saying this now and
[00:16:14] you've made it to this point of the
[00:16:16] video then you probably are one of those
[00:16:18] people that is willing to take this a
[00:16:19] little bit more seriously so for you I
[00:16:21] would recommend checking out my video on
[00:16:23] learner types put a link in the
[00:16:24] description but your learner type rather
[00:16:26] than learning style is what are the
[00:16:29] current systems and habits and methods
[00:16:31] that you currently are using and how is
[00:16:34] that either helping you or holding you
[00:16:36] back when you figure out your learn type
[00:16:37] it becomes much clearer why you might be
[00:16:40] having certain problems and why you
[00:16:41] might be better at certain things than
[00:16:43] others which then helps you to create a
[00:16:45] more efficient plan for how to improve I
[00:16:47] hope this video helped you if it did
[00:16:48] then make sure to subscribe so you don't
[00:16:50] miss my future uploads thank you so much
[00:16:52] for watching and I'll see you next

=== Most medical students waste time in hospital ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rQsk8PL4G0

[00:00:00] so if you spend 6 hours at a hospital
[00:00:02] you're not really getting like 6 hours
[00:00:04] of learning from that like the primary
[00:00:06] example I can think of is if you're in
[00:00:07] like a long operation and you're just
[00:00:09] watching and you're just I don't know
[00:00:10] you're holding a body cavity open for
[00:00:11] like 4 hours it's entirely possible to
[00:00:13] leave that experience Having learned
[00:00:15] absolutely nothing not only Having
[00:00:17] learned nothing all you have learned is
[00:00:18] that you never want to do surgery


=== How learning styles became a neuromyth ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l01LQG3mWlU

[00:00:00] if you believe that everyone has a
[00:00:01] unique learning style some people are
[00:00:03] visual some people are auditory then you
[00:00:06] would be just a normal person but you'd
[00:00:09] also be wrong it's what we call a neurom
[00:00:11] myth which is a belief about the brain
[00:00:13] which is just not true and it's one of
[00:00:15] the most widely believed neurom myths
[00:00:18] around the 70s that's also when we had
[00:00:20] this huge self-esteem movement and so
[00:00:22] therefore learning styles sort of fit in
[00:00:25] with that like yes I am a unique special
[00:00:27] human being and therefore I must have a
[00:00:30] unique special way of learning as well
[00:00:32] and so fast forward like 50 years it is
[00:00:35] now one of the most deeply ingrained
[00:00:38] myths about learning that we tend to
[00:00:40] believe


=== This will TRANSFORM your note-taking experience ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNYQ1gpcb-4

[00:00:00] once you can start writing notes
[00:00:01] nonlinearly and doing the right kind of
[00:00:03] thinking it just completely transforms
[00:00:06] your note-taking experience one of the
[00:00:08] other major advantages is that it shows
[00:00:11] you visually where your knowledge gaps
[00:00:13] and weaknesses are what I mean is that
[00:00:15] because each step of writing the notes
[00:00:18] actually requires you to think about it
[00:00:19] and process it and make a conscious
[00:00:21] decision about how you want to express
[00:00:23] it if you struggle with that then you
[00:00:26] know that that is an area of weakness it
[00:00:28] is a knowledge Gap and as a side effect
[00:00:30] we're also becoming more curious because
[00:00:32] we're finding the Gap and then we're
[00:00:34] filling the Gap as each Gap fills our
[00:00:37] knowledge is actually becoming
[00:00:39] fundamentally stronger and more
[00:00:40] connected and so our expertise is
[00:00:42] growing and then as we learn more it
[00:00:44] gets easier and easier and simpler to
[00:00:47] understand


=== Why hospitals are so inefficient? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR9z93BNbRY

[00:00:00] doctors often do have a very limited
[00:00:01] scope of understanding in terms of how
[00:00:03] organizations run having said that some
[00:00:05] of the ideas that I've heard are
[00:00:06] actually great and I just think there
[00:00:07] there's really no reason why that can't
[00:00:09] happen straight away but no instead the
[00:00:11] only thing that get clearance is like oh
[00:00:12] let's use a different template for the
[00:00:14] whiteboard in the nursing station so
[00:00:16] it's very sticky it's like tie you know
[00:00:18] it's very hard for existing systems and
[00:00:20] practices to change or things to be
[00:00:22] taken out or modif


=== Why learning apps WON'T always help you learn ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8PYUV0lirg

[00:00:00] so a major problem of a lot of the
[00:00:02] learning apps that are available is that
[00:00:04] they are made by software developers not
[00:00:07] learning experts what they're doing is
[00:00:10] they're basically replicating the same
[00:00:12] notetaking patterns and behaviors and
[00:00:14] Norms that people use with paper and
[00:00:17] then just converting that to the iPad
[00:00:19] and I have had a lot of discussions with
[00:00:21] some of these huge mega app developers
[00:00:24] and they are not willing to change their
[00:00:27] app to support learning SCI
[00:00:30] because it's just not a good business
[00:00:33] move as a learner that just means that
[00:00:36] you have to understand that using an app
[00:00:38] that is marketed for Learning and using
[00:00:41] it as designed does not necessarily mean
[00:00:44] that you are actually going to be
[00:00:45] learning efficiently


=== Watch this if you're struggling with learning ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij6Lhxpvk8g

[00:00:00] what are the things that kind of make
[00:00:01] the biggest difference for someone who
[00:00:04] like they don't have that background
[00:00:05] context they don't have these prior
[00:00:07] habits they are struggling they are
[00:00:09] putting you know often a lot of work a
[00:00:11] lot of effort a lot of time um a lot of
[00:00:13] sacrifice and that effort is not being
[00:00:15] met with either consistent or
[00:00:17] proportional rewards you just have to
[00:00:20] take it as an article of faith that like
[00:00:22] the thing that you're finding really
[00:00:23] difficult that is is really hard that as
[00:00:25] you keep building the components it's
[00:00:27] going to get easier and easier and so I
[00:00:28] think this is is a very difficult thing
[00:00:32] to believe in the moment that when
[00:00:34] you're in the process of learning
[00:00:36] something I think there's a sense that
[00:00:38] like you take it as a granted as fixed
[00:00:41] and uh so I think maybe the thing that I
[00:00:44] would shout from the rooftops that I
[00:00:46] feel like I've learned personally and
[00:00:47] that is you know abundantly verified by
[00:00:50] cognitive science is just how much the
[00:00:52] individual transforms as they're on the
[00:00:54] Continuum of expertise


=== Please stop studying like you want to fail ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9zIhxtE5ow

[00:00:00] if you forget everything about how you
[00:00:01] know studying normally works if you come
[00:00:03] in with a totally blank slate and you
[00:00:04] would say I need to learn something that
[00:00:06] knowledge needs to be in my head and I
[00:00:08] need to be able to use it any approach
[00:00:10] that involves you taking information in
[00:00:12] you thinking I think this is irrelevant
[00:00:13] I'm forgetting it as we speak but I am
[00:00:15] just going to repeat it in my head so
[00:00:17] many times that that knowledge sticks in
[00:00:19] my head even though I know that that's
[00:00:21] not going to allow me to use it at the
[00:00:22] level that I can use it none of that is
[00:00:24] logical it doesn't make any sense if you
[00:00:26] were that alien you would look at it
[00:00:28] with a blank slate and think well how do
[00:00:29] I need to use the information what is
[00:00:31] the level I need to achieve how long do
[00:00:33] I need to hold on to this information


=== Is there a goal behind your learning process? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGLTYoHCguA

[00:00:00] learning is always learning for
[00:00:02] something this idea of like being able
[00:00:04] to construct a goal that's going to
[00:00:06] guide your processing when you're doing
[00:00:08] something is a certain sense of skill
[00:00:09] that you have to acquire because in so
[00:00:11] many classroom contexts uh the goal is
[00:00:14] really well specified up front there
[00:00:16] will be a lot of students that say well
[00:00:17] I know that they're going to ask me
[00:00:18] these types of questions in the
[00:00:20] exam but when they consume that
[00:00:22] information it's still not more
[00:00:24] meaningful in a way because it hasn't
[00:00:26] actually created any more of a model
[00:00:30] it's kind of like a label of relevance
[00:00:32] like someone has just said you need to
[00:00:34] know it because you need to know it and
[00:00:36] so they still struggle like from a
[00:00:38] cognitive perspective with actually
[00:00:39] holding on to that information and so an
[00:00:41] angle that I look at it from is like how
[00:00:43] can we create that kind of same level of
[00:00:47] clear personal relevance even when
[00:00:50] objectively speaking it actually just is
[00:00:52] not that personally relevant


=== The difference between memorising & understanding ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35-1MIsacL0

[00:00:00] I used to have this kind of stronger
[00:00:01] distinction between like things you
[00:00:03] memorize and things you understand
[00:00:04] understanding is a real slippery concept
[00:00:06] right like it's easy to say whether
[00:00:08] someone remembers something but what
[00:00:09] does it mean to say someone understand
[00:00:10] something what we're doing when we
[00:00:12] understand something is you're
[00:00:13] constructing some kind of situation
[00:00:14] model it's that Fusion of knowledge you
[00:00:17] already have and knowledge you're
[00:00:18] gaining in the text to construct a
[00:00:20] representation that like it's not
[00:00:23] explicitly in the text like so much
[00:00:24] stuff is implied you have to know these
[00:00:26] other things in order for that to make
[00:00:28] sense and so the idea here is that like
[00:00:31] to really understand things fluently and
[00:00:32] expertly you have to have this huge
[00:00:34] knowledge base really just reading a lot
[00:00:36] is a good way to build up these mental
[00:00:38] models memory and understanding yeah are
[00:00:41] residues of thought and so when we think
[00:00:43] about it that way it's like so what are
[00:00:44] the thoughts that create better memory
[00:00:47] and better and deeper levels of
[00:00:49] understanding


=== Overrated/Underrated: Notion ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaA4gbxmVJc

[00:00:00] notion in the context of work or for
[00:00:02] study let's say it's for study for study
[00:00:04] overrated if the rating is here if this
[00:00:06] is over it is here I think notion is not
[00:00:09] designed for studying in any possible
[00:00:11] way I think it produces a lot of bad
[00:00:13] habits I think it reinforces ineffective
[00:00:16] cognitive processes I think it creates
[00:00:17] linearity of information I think it
[00:00:19] creates illusions of learning with
[00:00:20] relationships it does not tick the boxes
[00:00:22] in the way it needs to be tick it has
[00:00:24] potential though so notion if you want
[00:00:25] to reach out to me even though I
[00:00:26] absolutely roasted you um yeah please do


=== The tricky thing about giving learning advice ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QfyTQ5K5n8

[00:00:00] my earliest advice was using things like
[00:00:02] well you want to be using like analogies
[00:00:03] and metaphors to understand things
[00:00:04] because if you're learning abstract
[00:00:06] domains that is genuinely very useful
[00:00:08] and it is how really smart people
[00:00:10] process it but the problem is that I
[00:00:12] would give this advice to students and
[00:00:14] they're real beginners in a domain and
[00:00:16] the analogies they come up with don't
[00:00:17] make any sense so it's hard for people
[00:00:19] who are like I just want some tips to
[00:00:20] pass the next exam to give them advice
[00:00:23] because there's so many things you don't
[00:00:25] know about their situation that would
[00:00:27] necessarily affect what's the correct
[00:00:29] approach right and I think that comes
[00:00:30] down to the idea like some people have
[00:00:31] these deep processing habits and
[00:00:32] patterns of thinking that they are used
[00:00:34] to and that they're comfortable with we
[00:00:35] know now that a lot of that has to do
[00:00:37] with genetics and a lot of that has to
[00:00:38] do with their Early Childhood
[00:00:39] experiences and we know that based on
[00:00:41] that some people just have the ability
[00:00:43] to like form these connections and build
[00:00:45] these schemers in a way that is easier
[00:00:47] and more effective and then some people
[00:00:49] don't and then the question is well like
[00:00:51] how do we train the people that don't to
[00:00:53] get to the point where they find it
[00:00:55] easier


=== It's shocking how many doctors ask me this ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5xbop2XaxM

[00:00:00] asking should I quit medicine that's a
[00:00:01] very common question that I get I get it
[00:00:03] almost every single day through like one
[00:00:04] of my platforms and it's a very
[00:00:06] difficult question to answer not just
[00:00:07] because of the fact that it's inherently
[00:00:08] difficult but because it's obviously
[00:00:09] very personal like you there's a
[00:00:11] different thing that really hits the
[00:00:12] check mark for each different person in
[00:00:14] terms of what you need in terms of the
[00:00:16] level of fulfillment and how much of
[00:00:18] that you really need to have in your job
[00:00:20] so I personally really find it important
[00:00:23] that what I'm doing and how I'm spending
[00:00:25] my life is the way that I really want to
[00:00:27] be spending that life and I don't like
[00:00:29] to compromise on it and because of that
[00:00:32] I just felt that it wasn't really
[00:00:33] sustainable for me to be in medicine and
[00:00:34] still feel deeply fulfilled and
[00:00:36] satisfied and I thought medicon was high
[00:00:38] risk for that decision and I thought
[00:00:40] it's it's not a safe pathway for me to
[00:00:41] continue down if my primary outcome is
[00:00:43] fulfillment and satisfaction in the work
[00:00:45] that I'm doing


=== Talking Learning Science with best-selling author Scott H. Young ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtwaJu80Rk4

[00:00:00] I've known about you for ages you know
[00:00:01] and I knew about you as the bestseller
[00:00:03] author from day one that I that I knew
[00:00:08] you what are the topics like we don't
[00:00:11] agree
[00:00:14] on this video is going to be titled why
[00:00:17] Scott H young is a fraud and then it's
[00:00:18] going to be like know purp approval on
[00:00:23] that Scott young is a international
[00:00:27] best-selling author you might have heard
[00:00:28] of some of his books like Ultra learning
[00:00:30] which has been bought millions of times
[00:00:33] I've got a copy of it myself and this is
[00:00:35] the guy that knows his learning science
[00:00:37] apparently people have been asking Scott
[00:00:40] about his opinion of me and my work and
[00:00:42] one of my students shared an email
[00:00:44] interaction that he had with Scott we
[00:00:46] sends him my report on learning and then
[00:00:47] Scott was kind of critiquing parts of
[00:00:49] the research on it and being like yeah I
[00:00:51] don't know so I was like Scott I think
[00:00:54] you and I need to have a chat and Scott
[00:00:57] replied bring it on let's do it and this
[00:01:00] video is how that conversation went down
[00:01:02] now by the way this is essentially like
[00:01:04] two nerds nerding out so it does get a
[00:01:06] little bit technical if not into that
[00:01:08] then this video is not going to be for
[00:01:10] you but a lot of you guys seem to really
[00:01:12] like the indepth technical discussion so
[00:01:15] hope you like this one too I've been
[00:01:17] meaning to talk to you for a while
[00:01:20] because I tend to be like most of my
[00:01:23] reading is like trying to like have you
[00:01:25] know 400 books that are like kind of
[00:01:28] academic that it's like okay I need to
[00:01:29] read this so I'm always sort of like
[00:01:31] reading that as opposed to necessarily
[00:01:33] always keeping up with like what other
[00:01:35] people like myself are doing like who
[00:01:37] are kind of popularizing it or or
[00:01:39] disseminating it and so um I was getting
[00:01:42] all these emails like what do you think
[00:01:43] about Justin Su saying this or saying
[00:01:45] that and I always just say well I don't
[00:01:47] know that much about Justin so like I'm
[00:01:49] not like here to like adjudicate on it
[00:01:51] but I think it was um yeah know one
[00:01:52] reader sent it to me and then he sent me
[00:01:54] your uh report on learning and I thought
[00:01:57] well I should finally read some of this
[00:01:59] guy people keep sending me emails should
[00:02:02] read I'm amazed that I was actually on
[00:02:05] your radar cuz the thing is like I I
[00:02:07] first read your book um Ultra learning
[00:02:10] specifically I think I read it like
[00:02:12] three three or four years ago or
[00:02:15] something something like that and I
[00:02:18] remember um reading it and then being
[00:02:20] like oh this is actually this is
[00:02:21] actually like a good book cuz there's a
[00:02:22] lot of books no like no seriously
[00:02:24] because there actually like there's a
[00:02:26] lot of books on learning out there that
[00:02:28] I just think are like
[00:02:30] like they like they didn't really get it
[00:02:33] like you know like it's not really it's
[00:02:36] either way too like isolated or it
[00:02:38] doesn't really look at it kind of more
[00:02:39] holistically or it's um sometimes just
[00:02:42] wrong like just plainly like and I'm
[00:02:45] happy to talk with someone like when
[00:02:47] when the reader of mine sent me your uh
[00:02:49] report on learning um like it was true
[00:02:53] that okay well this guy actually has
[00:02:54] read a lot of research because that's
[00:02:56] not always true I feel like I don't want
[00:02:57] to being named names I don't like to
[00:02:59] like start with people but there are
[00:03:00] people in the learning space who like I
[00:03:05] don't know what they're reading they're
[00:03:06] not reading research like like there's a
[00:03:09] lot of stuff where it's like w I don't
[00:03:11] know about that I don't know about that
[00:03:12] so I feel like you're you're a
[00:03:14] conscientious and thoughtful person I
[00:03:15] don't know H like there's probably some
[00:03:18] stuff we agree with some stuff we
[00:03:19] disagree with and like we have different
[00:03:21] perspectives but I think um at least
[00:03:24] there's like the same you know we've
[00:03:26] read some of the same things we've
[00:03:27] thought about some of the same things as
[00:03:29] opposed to like you know you can talk to
[00:03:30] people who uh like learning especially
[00:03:33] is a topic that's you can kind of take
[00:03:35] it in a romantic Direction and so
[00:03:37] there's like people who write about it
[00:03:39] where there don't have any knowledge of
[00:03:41] any of the cognitive psychology
[00:03:44] educational psychology any of the like
[00:03:46] empirical results and you know they're
[00:03:49] saying things which are like you know
[00:03:51] maybe that's true but it's like totally
[00:03:52] divorced from any kind of um yeah thing
[00:03:55] there so I think there's a basically I
[00:03:56] think there's a deep reservoir of things
[00:03:59] that overlap that we've read that you
[00:04:01] know the basis of an opinion the basis
[00:04:03] of a conversation we could have yeah
[00:04:06] yeah definitely and I yeah you know
[00:04:08] you're not naming names but like I can
[00:04:09] think of a lot of those those instances
[00:04:12] I mean I think how I see myself is that
[00:04:14] like I'm in a position where I can spend
[00:04:17] a lot of time reading through the
[00:04:18] research and then I can spend a lot of
[00:04:20] time practicing and applying and really
[00:04:22] coaching it for people a lot of people
[00:04:24] have experience I think but their
[00:04:26] experience is through like I went and
[00:04:28] did a seminar I did a workshop at a
[00:04:30] Consulting and it's it's it's like a
[00:04:32] it's a
[00:04:33] cross-sectional view of what's Happening
[00:04:35] whereas I really find a lot of value in
[00:04:38] the
[00:04:38] longitudinal data of taking a group of
[00:04:41] Learners and following them very
[00:04:43] intimately for not just a couple weeks
[00:04:46] but like years even to see what is the
[00:04:48] impact and then where are all the
[00:04:49] permutations of the advice that I'm
[00:04:51] giving and kind of refining it that way
[00:04:53] so I mean we were just talking about how
[00:04:56] like people coming from different
[00:04:57] perspectives and stuff and I think uh
[00:05:00] my sort of starting point was very much
[00:05:03] like from the personal experience angle
[00:05:05] so when I was in university I was
[00:05:07] studying and and finding like
[00:05:09] experimenting on myself of like
[00:05:10] productivity strategies and these kind
[00:05:11] of things and there's some things that I
[00:05:13] think I probably got right when I was
[00:05:15] doing things and there's other things
[00:05:16] that like I've now learned well you know
[00:05:18] that kind of works sometimes but maybe
[00:05:20] it's not the best advice and so I've
[00:05:21] changed my mind about things and then um
[00:05:24] you know I did a bunch of big learning
[00:05:26] projects in my early 20s which were
[00:05:29] basically the way that I established my
[00:05:30] career which weren't research based but
[00:05:32] they were again me trying to take on
[00:05:35] kind of experiments and you know things
[00:05:37] that were hopefully interesting and
[00:05:38] useful to the audience and then it sort
[00:05:40] of was starting with doing the research
[00:05:42] for my book that I was going beyond the
[00:05:44] surface level of right doing reasing
[00:05:47] research and then I've got another book
[00:05:48] that's going to be coming out in May and
[00:05:50] I mean that one was like you know
[00:05:52] hundreds of books hundreds of papers
[00:05:54] like it was like years of just like
[00:05:55] reading research and so I feel like I've
[00:05:57] come around that way but I think I've
[00:05:59] come from a perspective where um you
[00:06:02] know I don't I don't kind of like trying
[00:06:04] to arrive at the stage being like well I
[00:06:06] know everything and you should listen to
[00:06:07] me I feel like I probably have the
[00:06:08] perspective of like well I have a track
[00:06:10] record for a long time period where I've
[00:06:12] been obsessed with this so hopefully I
[00:06:14] know something but I I prefer to have
[00:06:16] like discussions about it than just take
[00:06:18] the mantle of authority over it you know
[00:06:20] there's just really no substitute for
[00:06:22] you know if you want to know a topic
[00:06:24] like reading 150 books on there's no
[00:06:27] real way around that I mean you can
[00:06:29] definitely I've got a targeted goal I
[00:06:31] need to like know the abstract the
[00:06:34] executive summary but it's it's you know
[00:06:36] it's it's doing that work that I think
[00:06:38] um makes a big difference and so but
[00:06:40] there's still further I think there's
[00:06:42] still lots of places that I can drill
[00:06:43] deeper and and I think as well you know
[00:06:46] I I tend to be kind of eclectic in my
[00:06:48] interest so yeah and I totally agree
[00:06:50] like I like to read widely because I
[00:06:51] just think it gives you a more accurate
[00:06:54] perspective of the true State and I
[00:06:56] think there are a lot of gaps in one
[00:06:59] school of thought that actually filled
[00:07:01] from another school of of thought which
[00:07:05] on that note I want to dive into
[00:07:07] different schools of thought a little
[00:07:09] bit more so just yeah like just dropping
[00:07:11] straight into stuff that's like super
[00:07:12] technical so the stuff that I tend to
[00:07:14] read around is more like looking around
[00:07:16] how uh constructivist models of learning
[00:07:20] uh which are traditionally more first of
[00:07:23] all more like pedagogically focused and
[00:07:25] a lot more instruction focused and tend
[00:07:27] to be based more around Psych ology um
[00:07:30] how that integrates together with more
[00:07:33] cognitivist perspectives um and and the
[00:07:36] two previously like they didn't really
[00:07:38] mix too well like cognitive schools of
[00:07:40] thought like the big people there like
[00:07:41] John swall for example with cognitive
[00:07:43] load Theory like the cognitive school of
[00:07:45] thought is all about like how does the
[00:07:47] brain work like how how does learning
[00:07:50] work at a cognitive level like at a
[00:07:52] process level and how does that you know
[00:07:55] relate to all of these different things
[00:07:57] and link to all these different
[00:07:58] psychological theories
[00:08:00] and recently people have actually really
[00:08:02] been trying to bring them together to be
[00:08:04] like yes we've got these psychological
[00:08:06] Frameworks and theories and ways that we
[00:08:08] construct learning which is the
[00:08:11] constructivist argument but then the
[00:08:12] cognitivist perspective is like well
[00:08:14] these are the processes that allow that
[00:08:16] learning to be constructed in the first
[00:08:19] place and so I'm really interested in
[00:08:21] that interplay and all the research that
[00:08:22] surrounds that I'm really not super into
[00:08:27] the pedagogical aspect of it I just
[00:08:30] personally find it less interesting but
[00:08:32] also because I work directly with
[00:08:33] students so my goal is like let's assume
[00:08:36] you have a crap teacher let's assume you
[00:08:38] have a you know under resource School
[00:08:40] whatever it is like how do we make that
[00:08:42] work for you yeah I well I I think you
[00:08:45] and I have similar interests because I I
[00:08:47] mean my driving motivation was for
[00:08:50] wanting to learn better was myself like
[00:08:53] this is something that I care about I
[00:08:54] want to know how to do it better and you
[00:08:56] know everything that is kind of I've
[00:08:58] been doing has flown from that goal now
[00:09:01] I obviously care about giving good
[00:09:02] advice to people not just this works for
[00:09:04] me so I'm going to stick with it but
[00:09:06] it's a different goal than someone whose
[00:09:08] aim is to teach students or even more so
[00:09:12] to teach students that maybe don't even
[00:09:14] want to learn the thing that you're
[00:09:15] trying to teach them and like there's a
[00:09:17] lot of I think Real World um educational
[00:09:20] constraints that uh impinge on some of
[00:09:23] the goals so one of the things I find
[00:09:24] really frustrating about a lot of
[00:09:25] educational psychology is that there's a
[00:09:28] lot of emphasis on okay given that this
[00:09:31] is what we want to teach kids what is an
[00:09:33] efficient way to do that but there's a
[00:09:36] lot less emphasis on the well what is it
[00:09:39] exactly we should be teaching because
[00:09:40] other than like reading and writing and
[00:09:43] arithmetic which we all pretty much
[00:09:44] agree are important to be functional
[00:09:46] adults there's just huge uncertainty
[00:09:49] over like what are the actual knowledges
[00:09:51] and skills that effective people use in
[00:09:53] practice and so I remember reading um I
[00:09:56] forget which book it was but they were
[00:09:57] talking about how like
[00:09:59] uh the the idea of cognitive task
[00:10:01] analysis which is this sort of approach
[00:10:03] where you figure out what experts what
[00:10:05] knowledge they're actually using um and
[00:10:07] you can use this to deconstruct pedagogy
[00:10:09] so you can you know figure out if a
[00:10:10] surgeon is doing a surgery figure out
[00:10:12] what is the information that you
[00:10:13] actually need to know to do it so that
[00:10:15] you can optimize the teaching process
[00:10:17] which uh tends to be pretty bad in
[00:10:19] practice is usually like the see one do
[00:10:21] one teach one which I mean well it's not
[00:10:24] a you know there's worse ways you could
[00:10:26] do it but it's hardly like from a
[00:10:28] scientific basis of like this is the
[00:10:29] exact background knowledge this is exact
[00:10:31] like we do this and don't do this and
[00:10:33] pay attention to this and this so you
[00:10:35] know as a result we probably could be
[00:10:36] teaching surgeries better than we are
[00:10:38] right now but the issue is that like
[00:10:41] this kind of super specialized approach
[00:10:43] of doing cognitive task analysis to
[00:10:44] figure out what is the knowledge and
[00:10:46] skill component of uh real world work is
[00:10:49] essentially missing and so you have a
[00:10:51] lot of academics um who you know write
[00:10:54] books I'm thinking of uh I'm thinking of
[00:10:56] like Ed H and stuff who are writing
[00:10:58] books about like what every American
[00:11:00] should know and there's a lot of
[00:11:01] research on like the role of background
[00:11:03] knowledge and reading comprehension and
[00:11:05] this kind of stuff but I think like he's
[00:11:07] he's a little bit of an outlier in there
[00:11:09] that is even suggesting like well what
[00:11:11] is the actual content that that should
[00:11:12] be taught like what are the things that
[00:11:14] people should know and so my interest in
[00:11:16] learning is very much related to this
[00:11:18] process of how do you uh figure out what
[00:11:21] you should be learning because I think
[00:11:23] that's a huge part of it which in in a
[00:11:25] lot of educational psychology it's just
[00:11:27] like well the assumption is that the
[00:11:28] student will be will know these facts or
[00:11:30] or even you can look at these psychology
[00:11:32] experiments where they're just like the
[00:11:34] the information is really arbitrary and
[00:11:36] they're just really trying to identify a
[00:11:37] mechanism so I think you know um you and
[00:11:41] I probably have similar interest there
[00:11:42] because we're more student focused we're
[00:11:44] more like in the role of the learner
[00:11:46] what should you do I tend to be a little
[00:11:48] bit not super educationally focused
[00:11:50] period just because I feel like most of
[00:11:53] the people who come to me most of the
[00:11:54] people are learning from me are not
[00:11:55] actual like traditional students I do
[00:11:57] have some college students I do have
[00:11:58] some some high school students but a lot
[00:12:01] of people are like you know I want to be
[00:12:03] a better programmer in my job what
[00:12:04] should I be doing right and and I think
[00:12:07] that's a different question than like
[00:12:08] how do I pass this particular
[00:12:10] programming exam where like you know
[00:12:12] this is the curriculum and how do I get
[00:12:14] a good grade um so you know there's
[00:12:16] there's a lot of interesting kind of
[00:12:18] philosophical questions about that as
[00:12:20] well you know yeah well like when I
[00:12:21] first met the the program that I run it
[00:12:24] was mainly initially addressed for
[00:12:26] students but yeah like now if I look at
[00:12:28] the stats like 40% of all of our members
[00:12:30] are just professionals like they're
[00:12:31] graduates they managers CEOs they they
[00:12:34] entrepreneurs they're programmers or um
[00:12:38] or or they're like working full-time and
[00:12:40] not only are they learning on the job
[00:12:41] but they're also thinking um how do I
[00:12:44] work full-time and study full-time like
[00:12:46] if they're going back to UNI or doing a
[00:12:48] career swap or something yeah doing like
[00:12:50] a getting their CPA or you know whatever
[00:12:52] you yeah and I and I do agree that
[00:12:55] there's one thing that you said in Ultra
[00:12:56] learning which I um I think it might
[00:12:59] have been like actually just at the very
[00:13:00] beginning was just like the idea that
[00:13:02] you know like the modern world is
[00:13:04] there's like a there's like just too
[00:13:05] much to learn like there's too much
[00:13:07] going on it's constantly changing like
[00:13:09] the value of knowledge and just knowing
[00:13:11] things is just diminishing and it's more
[00:13:14] about like the value of being able to
[00:13:17] know what to learn and then being able
[00:13:20] to learn that even without having like
[00:13:22] clear specific guidance which I guess is
[00:13:24] the whole premise behind that
[00:13:27] self-directed learning approach
[00:13:29] well I think you know and and you you
[00:13:31] mentioned John sw's work so I I mean
[00:13:33] I've corresponded with John sweller and
[00:13:35] I think he's uh a very interesting
[00:13:37] thinker and I think he's one of these
[00:13:39] people that like he also bet on a really
[00:13:41] unpopular idea that's recently become
[00:13:43] more popular so it's like you think of
[00:13:44] the academic world is like stock picking
[00:13:46] or something as you pick an idea that's
[00:13:47] like not in fashion and so like the
[00:13:49] 1980s when he's like talking about like
[00:13:51] well we should be doing work examples
[00:13:54] and like this is right after new and
[00:13:56] Simon published human problem solving
[00:13:57] and like literally everyone like I'm
[00:13:59] reading you open up these um edited
[00:14:01] volumes and there's like chapters on
[00:14:03] physics where it's sort of like it's
[00:14:04] well known that like you know physics
[00:14:06] experts don't learn physics through
[00:14:08] lectures they like this was just such a
[00:14:10] such and so he's saying like no no no
[00:14:12] this is how you like so I I appreciate
[00:14:15] him I like him as a bit of an iconic
[00:14:16] class he's a little bit he definitely
[00:14:18] his beliefs range in like the more
[00:14:20] extreme Direction like he he adopts like
[00:14:22] on a sliding skill of like it's between
[00:14:24] zero and 10 he's like nine or 10 for a
[00:14:25] lot of beliefs he's definitely but he's
[00:14:28] useful for that purpose of like it's
[00:14:30] always good to be able to present like
[00:14:31] the pure version of an idea uh even if
[00:14:34] it's just a like you believe in
[00:14:36] something a bit more moderate just
[00:14:37] because it makes clear what what the
[00:14:39] actual ideology is and so I think um you
[00:14:42] know people who are of the Jean SW vay
[00:14:45] are looking at classroom context looking
[00:14:47] at the information that we have to
[00:14:48] impart students and they're saying okay
[00:14:51] well like this is the most efficient way
[00:14:52] to do it and I you know I I kind of
[00:14:54] agree that for like a lot of skills the
[00:14:56] seek for gangan the instruction direct
[00:14:59] instruction is actually probably an
[00:15:01] efficient way to do it especially for
[00:15:03] people who are you know you're not
[00:15:06] dealing with extremely motivated
[00:15:07] students you're not dealing with
[00:15:08] students that um have a lot of
[00:15:10] background ability uh the you know the
[00:15:12] secret Alman like if there's a problem
[00:15:14] with the teaching look at how it was
[00:15:16] taught not the student is like not how
[00:15:18] anyone thinks about teaching everyone
[00:15:19] thinks oh the problem is the student was
[00:15:21] too dumb they couldn't understand it and
[00:15:22] so I think there's a lot of value to
[00:15:24] that approach but the thing that I
[00:15:26] realize when I'm like writing my book is
[00:15:27] that this is essentially aert as advice
[00:15:30] to you because like if the assumption is
[00:15:32] well I want the best possible teacher
[00:15:33] who's going to break it down to me to
[00:15:35] the every single step it's like well
[00:15:38] those resources actually don't exist
[00:15:39] like outside of like phonics instruction
[00:15:41] and a few specialized skills like there
[00:15:43] are no di curriculums for doing these
[00:15:45] kinds of things so I think my interest
[00:15:47] is like I kind of am naturally pulled in
[00:15:51] the constructivist kind of Paradigm
[00:15:54] Simply Be simply because you're forced
[00:15:56] to like if you are the learner and
[00:15:57] you're designing your own project which
[00:16:00] I'm not going to make any claims about
[00:16:02] that being more or less effective than a
[00:16:04] a patient teacher who will explain to
[00:16:05] you exactly what to do but more just the
[00:16:08] people I talk to they're trying to learn
[00:16:10] a skill and they have very minimal
[00:16:12] access to teachers or they only have a
[00:16:13] few fixed resources or they only have a
[00:16:15] few things and so the question is how do
[00:16:17] you make those choices intelligently and
[00:16:19] so I think just you and I are focused on
[00:16:22] the student themselves you you you
[00:16:24] naturally get pulled into um pedagogic
[00:16:28] techniques that lean constructivist just
[00:16:30] because well who are you giving the
[00:16:32] advice to you're not giving it to the
[00:16:33] teacher you're giving it to the student
[00:16:35] and so self-explanations for instance
[00:16:37] like that's a that's a you know
[00:16:39] technique that I'm a I'm really big um
[00:16:42] fan of and the critiques of
[00:16:43] self-explanations are well maybe the
[00:16:45] teacher should give the explanation but
[00:16:47] if the teacher's not giving the
[00:16:48] explanation the alternative is
[00:16:49] self-explanation or I don't know what
[00:16:51] like that's not even the point I mean
[00:16:53] you don't even want like spontaneous
[00:16:55] self-explanation as a generative tool of
[00:16:57] learning is so powerful like you don't
[00:16:59] even want the teacher to give you the
[00:17:01] explanation I think and what you're
[00:17:03] talking about I think is a really um
[00:17:05] like it's a really on point I think
[00:17:07] criticism of cognitivism because I
[00:17:09] started like uh I started learning about
[00:17:13] things from a constructivist perspective
[00:17:15] I I think everyone kind of starts from
[00:17:17] because that's more common one and then
[00:17:19] I kind of went like I swung the other
[00:17:21] way to you know cognitivist and then now
[00:17:22] I'm kind of like Landing in the The
[00:17:24] Mixing ground in the middle and one of
[00:17:26] the criticisms I personally have of like
[00:17:28] ism is that there's very very very
[00:17:31] little in cognitivist research that is
[00:17:34] aimed at the learner like it's all
[00:17:37] instructional design and how like
[00:17:40] recently educational psychology r large
[00:17:43] too you know like even even
[00:17:45] constructivist teaching advice is like
[00:17:47] you want to be the uh what is it the
[00:17:49] sage on the side not the what is not
[00:17:52] guide on the side not the sage on the
[00:17:53] stage guide on the side not the sage on
[00:17:54] the stage screw it up but like but like
[00:17:57] these kind of things are aimed at
[00:17:58] teachers and I think um you know like as
[00:18:01] I said I tend I'm more on the cognitive
[00:18:04] side I think than maybe uh you are
[00:18:06] although I tend to not draw the
[00:18:08] distinction between cognitivism and
[00:18:10] constructivism I would draw maybe
[00:18:12] between like uh instructional ISM versus
[00:18:15] constructivism because I think cogn uh
[00:18:17] uh constructivism is a cognitive theory
[00:18:20] like this is something that was it's not
[00:18:22] a behavioristic theory right like it's
[00:18:23] definitely something that comes out of
[00:18:25] well people are making these sort of
[00:18:28] comp Lex mental representations in their
[00:18:31] heads and they are creating them and
[00:18:33] like so you know I think um there's
[00:18:36] different schools within that but I
[00:18:38] think pretty much anyone who's doing
[00:18:39] research now is some kind of cognitive
[00:18:42] thinker like I mean I guess you can say
[00:18:44] like the people who are like the I don't
[00:18:47] know you can say like the Gan Lees or
[00:18:49] the uh Barber rofs or like the you know
[00:18:51] some of those people are like explicitly
[00:18:53] anti- cognitivist but I think they they
[00:18:55] tend to be more on the like the the
[00:18:57] periphery you know the the
[00:18:59] anthropologists and um philosophers and
[00:19:01] stuff but I mean most people are doing
[00:19:03] research are the question is how much
[00:19:06] instructional support should you give
[00:19:07] what should you be giving when should
[00:19:08] you be giving it I think these are open
[00:19:10] questions I mean I'm really interested
[00:19:12] in also work like um like Manu kapur's
[00:19:15] uh productive failure um you know
[00:19:17] because he like he's like the kind of
[00:19:20] guy who gets in uh fights with John
[00:19:22] sweller because he's like well no but if
[00:19:24] you if you let people do this kind of
[00:19:26] constructivist uh explor in the problem
[00:19:29] space on their own first and then you
[00:19:31] explain the sort of correct method they
[00:19:33] understand it better my point of view
[00:19:35] from the from the students perspective
[00:19:37] is more like what are the kind of basic
[00:19:39] ingredients that you need to learn
[00:19:41] things and I think you need to for most
[00:19:42] skills you need to have some kind of um
[00:19:46] some kind of examples to learn from so
[00:19:47] you can see sort of like what are
[00:19:49] productive methods what are ways to do
[00:19:50] things that are effective and then you
[00:19:52] need to do a lot of practice and that
[00:19:55] tends to involve like trying to sort out
[00:19:57] okay what works in what situations why
[00:19:59] does it work um so I think you end up
[00:20:02] having to do both of those things yeah
[00:20:04] one of the angles that I often take on
[00:20:05] on this like just even broader topic is
[00:20:09] I kind of think that in most schools and
[00:20:13] probably in most classes the quality of
[00:20:17] teaching isn't the best that it could be
[00:20:19] you know based on all the research but I
[00:20:21] sort of think like we're reaching a
[00:20:23] point where it's it's probably not the
[00:20:26] main bottleneck anymore like I think
[00:20:28] General pedagogical principles that are
[00:20:31] relatively widely followed like they're
[00:20:33] probably good enough for someone to
[00:20:34] learn well from if they knew how to take
[00:20:37] that information and work with it in the
[00:20:38] right way and so I have a lot of focus
[00:20:40] on like okay you've got some people that
[00:20:42] could receive the worst type of
[00:20:43] instruction and the worst no examples no
[00:20:46] whatever like essentially just purely
[00:20:49] learning independently and they they can
[00:20:52] develop very deep expertise uh you know
[00:20:55] have great memory all of these things
[00:20:57] being incredibly efficient learner and
[00:20:59] you've got someone else that might
[00:21:00] struggle even if they have what is
[00:21:01] considered like best practice teaching
[00:21:04] which you know whatever that means and
[00:21:07] so I sort of think about it from like
[00:21:09] the perspective that well what is going
[00:21:11] on inside the inside the head of that
[00:21:14] student that's able to just make it work
[00:21:15] for them like how are they manipulating
[00:21:17] and processing that information and how
[00:21:19] are they able to navigate learning
[00:21:21] explore it in an effective way um to to
[00:21:25] get to a spontaneous self-explanation
[00:21:26] that's meaningful like inquiry based
[00:21:28] learning I think is a really really good
[00:21:30] example of this where there's a lot of
[00:21:32] uh good proponents for inquiry based
[00:21:34] learning and the theory has a lot kind
[00:21:37] of going for it but honestly the
[00:21:39] execution of inquiry based learning and
[00:21:41] the implementation and the lack of
[00:21:43] guidance it like really cripples it I
[00:21:45] mean when you look at these like
[00:21:47] metaanalytical level studies on inquiry
[00:21:49] based learning it's like does it even
[00:21:51] have an effect and there's like so much
[00:21:54] instructional um variation and
[00:21:56] dependency and like it depends on and
[00:21:58] the facilitator and intrinsic motivation
[00:21:59] issues and all of that and it's like
[00:22:01] yeah you know inquiry based learning
[00:22:04] purely as just a theory there is a lot
[00:22:06] of Merit to it yeah but like if we're if
[00:22:09] we're constantly looking at like what's
[00:22:11] the perfect perfect way to guide the
[00:22:13] teacher to like control the cognitive
[00:22:15] process of every single student inside
[00:22:17] the classroom I just sort of think
[00:22:18] that's not even really viable like
[00:22:20] that's not even conceptually seems
[00:22:22] realistic yeah so I think what you're
[00:22:24] saying is probably correct like I think
[00:22:26] there's a lot of Vari in how these
[00:22:29] principles are implemented and like this
[00:22:31] is the thing that I also am finding
[00:22:33] frustrating as I get deeper is that you
[00:22:35] start to realize that like once you get
[00:22:37] a few basic uh building blocks in the
[00:22:40] nuances of like the the student the
[00:22:43] curriculum the like the specifics really
[00:22:46] start to matter and so advice that you
[00:22:48] do X in this situation and Y in the
[00:22:50] other situation it starts to be less
[00:22:51] clear it's not just well do this like do
[00:22:55] flashcards for instance it's knowing
[00:22:57] exactly which flash cards you make which
[00:22:58] things should be done with flash cards
[00:23:00] which things shouldn't be done with
[00:23:01] flash cards but like and that's hard to
[00:23:03] explain to people without having a
[00:23:04] mental model of how the learning process
[00:23:06] works like um you know like flash cards
[00:23:09] is an example that I think is very
[00:23:11] interesting because even within language
[00:23:12] learning which is one of I think the
[00:23:15] like early language learning one of the
[00:23:16] clearest the clearest cases where flash
[00:23:18] cards could be beneficial like I would I
[00:23:20] would not I basically don't use it if
[00:23:22] I'm like learning like physics or
[00:23:23] something like I I don't think it's that
[00:23:25] useful for that but but language
[00:23:27] learning we have to memorize a lot of
[00:23:28] vocabulary it's like at least a tool
[00:23:30] that it makes sense in that context but
[00:23:33] even there there's a lot of factors that
[00:23:34] determine whether it's effective and so
[00:23:36] sometimes I'll give people advice like
[00:23:38] oh you want to do flash cards and then
[00:23:39] they'll be emailing me their specific
[00:23:41] flash cards and you're kind of like no
[00:23:43] don't don't do that because you're GNA
[00:23:45] have this problem so like an example
[00:23:48] someone was um someone was like kind of
[00:23:50] an intermediate level of English their
[00:23:52] background language was
[00:23:54] French and they were uh showing me
[00:23:57] examples of Flash cards they were making
[00:23:58] for learning English and the issue they
[00:24:00] were having is like okay you can do
[00:24:02] flash cards where you're going from the
[00:24:05] um uh so I I'll say from your from your
[00:24:09] native language to the target language
[00:24:11] um so in this case this person is trying
[00:24:12] to learn English so they have French on
[00:24:14] one side they're going to English and
[00:24:16] the idea is that this person was trying
[00:24:18] to learn more and more sophisticated
[00:24:20] vocabulary so you're starting to get
[00:24:21] into an area where there's now synonyms
[00:24:23] for words that you have and the issue is
[00:24:25] that like from a zero context flag card
[00:24:28] where you do like I want to do uh like
[00:24:30] the word red I'm going to use English
[00:24:31] for both of them so it makes sense but
[00:24:33] I'm going to do red and then I can say
[00:24:34] like Crimson Vermillion Scarlet like all
[00:24:37] these words that also mean red they
[00:24:38] don't exactly mean the same thing but
[00:24:41] you know they basically mean red and you
[00:24:43] know you have to pick up the context for
[00:24:45] youing like flash cards are a bad way to
[00:24:46] learn synonyms like that because you're
[00:24:49] essentially doing this like like you
[00:24:51] know from memory studies that if you're
[00:24:53] trying to do a single input and have
[00:24:55] multiple different responses that's like
[00:24:57] the the highest level of negative
[00:24:58] transfer that's the highest level of
[00:25:00] interference you know um even the
[00:25:02] behaviorist back like osgod had this
[00:25:04] whole transfer surface and it was like
[00:25:05] that was like the lowest point like the
[00:25:07] hardest point where you're having the
[00:25:09] most difficulty learning like I was
[00:25:10] trying to tell them you know what I
[00:25:11] probably like there's maybe a creative
[00:25:14] way to use flash cards to get around
[00:25:16] this problem but to me it's just like at
[00:25:18] that point don't use flash cards right
[00:25:20] like if you're trying to have more
[00:25:22] expressive writing where you're using
[00:25:23] more vocabulary I mean do these little
[00:25:25] essay assignments get someone to grade
[00:25:28] and then like you know you can set up
[00:25:29] constraints where you like they just
[00:25:31] like highlight some words and say like
[00:25:32] use a different word in this context or
[00:25:34] try a different word like that's how I
[00:25:35] as a writer build up a large vocabulary
[00:25:38] that I can produce is by writing and
[00:25:40] trying to avoid using the same word for
[00:25:42] the same concept you try to like you
[00:25:44] know that if you read any highbrow
[00:25:46] writing that's what they're going to do
[00:25:47] they're going to use synonyms and so
[00:25:48] like this is an example where like a
[00:25:50] technique flash
[00:25:52] cards it works but then you you you move
[00:25:55] it outside of its Central par parody
[00:25:57] Dynamic context and it it just now it's
[00:25:59] no longer useful for you yeah and I
[00:26:02] think that you know what you said about
[00:26:03] nuances like I like to think of myself
[00:26:05] as a Nuance guy like I think that the
[00:26:07] new the details that's where the the the
[00:26:09] power is and um like one of the things
[00:26:11] that I see really often is when you
[00:26:13] don't understand the Nuance you don't
[00:26:14] understand the conditions necessary to
[00:26:16] make something work like you don't
[00:26:17] understand the the win criteria and if
[00:26:20] you think the only win criteria is that
[00:26:22] you used the technique and then you
[00:26:25] don't win which statistically speaking
[00:26:27] is just a majority of people like the
[00:26:29] only people that can not know the win
[00:26:30] criteria use a technique and still make
[00:26:32] it work are the people who have such a
[00:26:35] high level of deep processing that they
[00:26:36] can probably just use any technique and
[00:26:38] they will just somehow be able to make
[00:26:39] it work for them and these are the
[00:26:40] people that will like post their tips on
[00:26:43] Tik Tok and and and you know they'll say
[00:26:46] like hey this is the technique I use you
[00:26:47] know I'm like this top student just do
[00:26:49] what I do and you've got like millions
[00:26:50] of people that that their only
[00:26:52] understanding is based on the fact that
[00:26:54] okay this top student did this it worked
[00:26:57] for them
[00:26:58] I don't know anything else about like
[00:27:00] how to make it work I'm just going to
[00:27:01] use it and they fully commit to it and
[00:27:03] if they don't do it then the only
[00:27:04] logical conclusion from this sphere of
[00:27:06] understanding is I'm just an idiot like
[00:27:08] I'm not smart enough I'm not capable and
[00:27:10] I see that like literally like every
[00:27:13] single day I have students that have
[00:27:14] been almost trained to believe that they
[00:27:17] are stupid yeah because of the fact that
[00:27:20] they don't understand the nuance and so
[00:27:23] I try to like unpack the Nuance a lot
[00:27:24] but again like the algorithm punishes it
[00:27:26] like when I make YouTube videos that go
[00:27:28] too much into the detail and the Nuance
[00:27:30] it's like people are like I don't want
[00:27:32] that I want the quick tip and then if I
[00:27:34] make the quick tip it's just like well
[00:27:36] this isn't detailed enough and then so
[00:27:38] almost I feel like really social media
[00:27:41] in general is it's actually a very I
[00:27:44] know a lot of people say like YouTube's
[00:27:45] a great source of learning and I do
[00:27:47] agree like generally speaking but at the
[00:27:49] same time I really think it is not when
[00:27:51] you what you're trying to learn is not
[00:27:53] what you expect it to be like I think if
[00:27:56] you're trying to learn like quantum
[00:27:57] physics you's going be a l to learn
[00:27:59] there but think a lot of people learning
[00:28:02] to be
[00:28:04] pryle tips they just want like yeah the
[00:28:07] 30- second Tik Tok and if it's not that
[00:28:09] then they're kind of put off by it and I
[00:28:11] think it it makes it really hard to
[00:28:13] actually deliver like well I think this
[00:28:15] is just a tragedy of expertise for
[00:28:17] anything and you know like if you think
[00:28:20] about like a physicist right I mean like
[00:28:23] there's this famous study that like what
[00:28:25] what the physicists were doing
[00:28:26] differently when they would see the
[00:28:28] physics problems is they can categorize
[00:28:29] it based on deep principles novices by
[00:28:31] and large can't do that not only because
[00:28:33] they don't know the Deep principles but
[00:28:34] because they don't have like this kind
[00:28:35] of abstract mental representation of
[00:28:37] like physics and like okay well in this
[00:28:39] kind of problem this is going to be the
[00:28:41] invariant and then these are the things
[00:28:43] that are going to change and you know
[00:28:44] you're not able to think of it that way
[00:28:45] so you just say oh it's a pulley one how
[00:28:47] did I do pulley ones before this is a
[00:28:49] ramp one how do you do ramp ones and
[00:28:51] it's easy to like mock the people are
[00:28:52] saying pulley ones and ramp ones but
[00:28:54] it's just because their their knowledge
[00:28:57] of the problem domain is weak enough
[00:28:59] that that's the only input they have
[00:29:01] they only have knowledge about like that
[00:29:03] py example or a ramp example and so in a
[00:29:06] similar way I think it's like that with
[00:29:08] learning um I mean obviously learning is
[00:29:11] not scientific in the way that physics
[00:29:13] is so that like you don't have like a
[00:29:15] guaranteed canonical right answer but
[00:29:18] there's ideas like again this this idea
[00:29:20] of you know using the flashcards in an
[00:29:23] expert-like way would be sort of to
[00:29:26] understand okay hey um these are the
[00:29:29] kind of situations where this is going
[00:29:30] to be effective these are going to be
[00:29:31] the kind of situations where I'm going
[00:29:32] to run into certain problems and maybe
[00:29:34] the problems are so big that it's not
[00:29:36] worth doing and also you know for for me
[00:29:39] like as a practical matter when I was
[00:29:40] learning Spanish I didn't use flashcards
[00:29:42] at all when I was learning manner in
[00:29:43] Chinese I use so many flashcards even
[00:29:46] with the you know same starting from
[00:29:48] scratch conditions you're using
[00:29:49] different things but it's because like
[00:29:51] we can go to John SP they have cognitive
[00:29:53] load that like if you hear a Spanish
[00:29:55] word and you can pick it out of Contex
[00:29:57] text and understand it and remember it
[00:29:59] oh creativity is a creativ it's like
[00:30:02] okay I can remember that you know once
[00:30:03] you have the phology there you don't
[00:30:06] need to do a lot of flashcards it's
[00:30:07] actually better to just do reading
[00:30:08] because you're getting the context as
[00:30:09] well whereas if you know you you walk up
[00:30:12] to a Chinese person and you say
[00:30:13] something they send something back to
[00:30:14] you and it's not even like you couldn't
[00:30:16] even write it down on your phone what
[00:30:17] they said to you because you you just
[00:30:18] cannot process the The Sounds yet you
[00:30:21] can't like I have no idea what they said
[00:30:23] then like yeah grinding flashcards is
[00:30:25] going to help you build some of that
[00:30:26] base and so yeah it's a comprehensive
[00:30:28] comprehensible input you need this
[00:30:30] deeper concept of cognitive load Theory
[00:30:33] and the kind of idea that like you know
[00:30:35] of chunking and the idea that like you
[00:30:37] know the amount of mental bandwidth it
[00:30:39] takes depends on sort of how much prior
[00:30:41] experience you have with certain
[00:30:42] knowledge types and that it changes the
[00:30:44] efficacy of like isolating drills versus
[00:30:47] you know more kind of like
[00:30:48] contextualized practice and and
[00:30:50] similarly you know I used to give advice
[00:30:52] like I think I also started a little bit
[00:30:54] more on a constructivist Direction but
[00:30:56] like my earliest advice viice was using
[00:30:57] things like well you want to be using
[00:30:59] like analogies and metaphors to
[00:31:00] understand things because if you're
[00:31:02] learning abstract domains that is
[00:31:03] genuinely very useful and it is how
[00:31:05] really smart people process it but the
[00:31:08] problem is that I would give this advice
[00:31:09] to students and they're real beginners
[00:31:11] in a domain and the analogies they come
[00:31:13] up with don't make any sense and it's
[00:31:15] like well but that doesn't match the
[00:31:17] idea at all that's just like picking up
[00:31:19] some superficial element and so I had
[00:31:21] made the same mistake that you know if
[00:31:23] you're teaching physics to people you're
[00:31:24] like well don't see the ramp or the
[00:31:26] pulley see that it
[00:31:27] you know a problem of
[00:31:30] um uh a problem of conservation of
[00:31:32] energy and the idea is just that like
[00:31:35] recognizing um the sort of principles
[00:31:37] based approach or the analogy requires
[00:31:39] you to already have some kind of like
[00:31:42] understanding and so how do you
[00:31:42] bootstrap that understanding and so I
[00:31:45] think the you know what works in
[00:31:48] learning for advice to students as well
[00:31:50] as what works in advice to teaching just
[00:31:52] because there are so many factors so
[00:31:54] many mental models that you would need
[00:31:56] to like tailor the advice to that
[00:31:57] situation then I mean you know yeah we
[00:31:59] can study like really hard-coded
[00:32:02] curricula like does Phonics work better
[00:32:04] than balance literacy or whatever but I
[00:32:06] mean for most questions that are not
[00:32:08] that well studied uh like you you kind
[00:32:11] of have to do the principled approach
[00:32:12] but the only way you can learn the
[00:32:13] principles is to have like lots of
[00:32:14] examples lots of experience and so it's
[00:32:15] hard for people who are like I just want
[00:32:17] some tips to pass the next exam to give
[00:32:19] them advice um because there's so many
[00:32:22] things you don't know about their
[00:32:23] situation that would necessarily affect
[00:32:25] what's the correct approach right and I
[00:32:27] think that comes down to the idea like
[00:32:28] some people have these deep processing
[00:32:30] habits and patterns of thinking that
[00:32:31] they used to and that they're
[00:32:32] comfortable with and a lot of that comes
[00:32:34] down to partly we know now that a lot of
[00:32:36] that has to do with genetics and a lot
[00:32:37] of that has to do with their Early
[00:32:38] Childhood experiences and um we like we
[00:32:42] know that based on that some people just
[00:32:43] have the ability to like form these
[00:32:45] connections and build these schemas in a
[00:32:48] way that is easier and more effective
[00:32:49] and then some people don't and then the
[00:32:51] question is well like how do we train
[00:32:53] the people that don't to get to the
[00:32:54] point where they find it you know easier
[00:32:57] and they may not ever get to the level
[00:32:59] where they are like an apex like genius
[00:33:03] um but you know most people probably
[00:33:05] everyone can um improve on that which is
[00:33:09] a seg way to like something that I want
[00:33:10] to go through like I want to find what
[00:33:13] are the topics like we don't agree on
[00:33:15] because we we clearly agree on a lot of
[00:33:18] things and I I want to I want to find
[00:33:20] things like that we potentially don't
[00:33:21] agree on I think that's going to be a
[00:33:22] really interesting discussion in general
[00:33:24] like i' really just want to get your
[00:33:25] perspective yeah like I think think you
[00:33:27] know again because we're talking about
[00:33:29] like it's very hard to speak in
[00:33:31] generality so I mean I could I could
[00:33:33] make a broad statement like I think
[00:33:34] maybe I'm more a fan of direct
[00:33:36] instruction than maybe you are like you
[00:33:38] talk about your sympathy for inquiry
[00:33:39] based learning I think I'm more on the
[00:33:40] direct instruction camp but oh actually
[00:33:43] no I I'm really a DI guy actually I'm
[00:33:45] more di than I I I have a problem I like
[00:33:49] inquiry based learning as a as a
[00:33:52] starting framework to think about the
[00:33:55] learner's role in The Learning process
[00:33:57] and the self-directed aspect of it and
[00:34:00] what inquiry can do for aiding
[00:34:02] construction but I'm a really like
[00:34:05] negative believer in the the
[00:34:08] conventional ways that inquiry based
[00:34:10] learning is actually implemented and
[00:34:12] thought about I think di is like frankly
[00:34:16] Superior to inquiry based learning in
[00:34:18] almost all situations in like especially
[00:34:22] in like a pedagogical framework like in
[00:34:23] terms of actually teaching this to
[00:34:24] teachers that can actually then like
[00:34:25] pull it off yeah I think inquir based
[00:34:27] learning can be really powerful for a
[00:34:29] learner to understand some of the
[00:34:30] principles of and then use it as a
[00:34:32] springboard so one of the things that I
[00:34:34] actually teach is like I say okay well
[00:34:36] how do you gain the skills to first of
[00:34:37] all like gain more inquiry about a topic
[00:34:40] right just to learn to be more
[00:34:41] inquisitive and then how does exploring
[00:34:45] that like exploring the question open up
[00:34:48] to exploring more about a topic and
[00:34:50] seeing different perspectives and then
[00:34:52] how can then you use that information to
[00:34:54] construct the model yeah that that you
[00:34:57] feel is like a good overall framework
[00:35:00] that you can scaffold off of and then
[00:35:01] how do you update that scaffold over
[00:35:03] time as you then gain more information
[00:35:06] so it's fundamentally like a lot of
[00:35:08] people would look at that and be like
[00:35:09] that's a you know pretty like purist
[00:35:11] inquiry based kind of kind of approach
[00:35:13] to it whereas actually no one talks
[00:35:17] about inquiry based learning from like a
[00:35:19] self-regulated learn a self-explaining a
[00:35:22] mental model kind of perspective it's
[00:35:25] just like here's a problem let's all try
[00:35:27] to solve the problem what do you want to
[00:35:29] learn like it's just so General yeah
[00:35:33] yeah I mean I don't know but I think I
[00:35:35] try to avoid a lot of like pedagogically
[00:35:37] focused talks just because my own
[00:35:39] experience is distant from that I mean
[00:35:41] you are even spending a lot more time
[00:35:44] coaching individual students I do have
[00:35:46] cohorts of students who go through my
[00:35:47] courses so I'm getting feedback but I
[00:35:49] have done some like private coaching
[00:35:51] programs but it's not my like bread and
[00:35:53] butter and so most of most of my
[00:35:55] interest again goes back to this real
[00:35:56] selfish pursuit of like you know I'm
[00:35:59] interested in learning things what would
[00:36:01] be the right way to learn something and
[00:36:02] so like using the language learning
[00:36:04] example I've now done a couple of them
[00:36:05] and it's sort of like what would be the
[00:36:06] right way to do that what was the
[00:36:08] problem with how I did that the last
[00:36:09] time and like what would I do next in
[00:36:11] the in in the future so I don't know I'm
[00:36:13] not sure uh it's hard to know what our
[00:36:15] exact points of disagreement would be on
[00:36:16] because again like you know you can
[00:36:18] speak in generalities of like I'm team
[00:36:20] di I'm team Constructors or whatever but
[00:36:23] then you get boiled down to like okay
[00:36:25] this is the exact situation this is what
[00:36:27] the goal is what are we like what what
[00:36:29] would be the best way to achieve that
[00:36:30] goal um you know those concrete things
[00:36:33] of where you're applying the principles
[00:36:34] I think some of the things that I've
[00:36:35] shifted in my my viewpoint over time is
[00:36:38] that I tend to feel like uh I'm more Pro
[00:36:43] knowledge and memory than maybe I was
[00:36:45] before I used to have this kind of dis
[00:36:46] stronger distinction between like things
[00:36:48] you memorize and things you understand
[00:36:50] and my feeling now about understanding
[00:36:53] because understanding is a real slippery
[00:36:54] concept right like it's easy to say
[00:36:56] whether someone remembers something but
[00:36:57] what does it mean to say someone
[00:36:59] understand something and it's it's like
[00:37:00] one of those questions that once you
[00:37:01] start asking you start digging and you
[00:37:03] start digging um you get to interesting
[00:37:05] places and so my current kind of like
[00:37:07] mental model of understanding uh which
[00:37:09] is itself a kind of mental model is is
[00:37:12] really heavily influenced by uh Walter
[00:37:14] kinch's um construction integration
[00:37:16] theory of reading comprehension and
[00:37:18] basically his idea is that like what
[00:37:20] we're doing when we understand something
[00:37:21] is you're constructing some kind of
[00:37:23] situation model of what well like in his
[00:37:25] case of what you're reading you're
[00:37:26] constructing some kind of situational
[00:37:27] model and what they've learned from
[00:37:29] reading comprehension studies is that
[00:37:32] you're um to to do that process to
[00:37:35] understand something you're combining
[00:37:37] what you extract from the text with
[00:37:40] knowledge you already have from
[00:37:41] somewhere else and it can come from
[00:37:42] different places but it's that Fusion of
[00:37:45] knowledge you already have and knowledge
[00:37:46] you're gaining in the text to construct
[00:37:48] a representation that like it's not
[00:37:51] explicitly in the text like so much
[00:37:53] stuff is implied you have to know these
[00:37:55] other things in order for that to make
[00:37:57] sense and so the idea here is that like
[00:37:59] to really understand things fluently and
[00:38:01] expertly you have to have this huge
[00:38:03] knowledge base now it doesn't mean that
[00:38:05] you should be like drilling it with
[00:38:07] flash cards like flash cards are really
[00:38:09] good for a kind of like fluent
[00:38:10] associative memory between two things
[00:38:12] but really just reading a lot is a good
[00:38:14] way to build up these mental models and
[00:38:16] like drilling deeper into questions and
[00:38:18] you know if you read a book read the
[00:38:20] rebuttal for the book to figure out why
[00:38:21] the people thought the first theory was
[00:38:23] wrong like that's going to help you
[00:38:24] really understand it better like people
[00:38:26] who are experts they just know so many
[00:38:28] things that when you know you're talking
[00:38:30] about psychology and you talk to someone
[00:38:31] who's been in the field for like 50
[00:38:33] years they're just sort of like oh yeah
[00:38:35] well that's this idea that so and so had
[00:38:37] that's related to this and this and
[00:38:38] you're kind of like how do they know all
[00:38:39] this but it's because you know the just
[00:38:41] the layers of layers of repeated like
[00:38:43] constructing the situation model of this
[00:38:45] of this of this it just becomes all
[00:38:47] Associated and fluent and so I think um
[00:38:50] for a lot of people the reason they
[00:38:52] struggle is because of that background
[00:38:53] knowledge deficit the cognitive load is
[00:38:56] super high
[00:38:57] they can't construct a situation model
[00:38:58] because they don't actually have all the
[00:39:00] information they need to construct the
[00:39:01] situation model and so they naturally
[00:39:04] gravitate towards like well I'm going to
[00:39:06] memorize this because there's no
[00:39:07] situation model they don't understand it
[00:39:09] but it's not correct to say that like
[00:39:12] well the problem is that they need to
[00:39:13] understand not memorize the problem is
[00:39:15] that well they don't have the memories
[00:39:16] that weren't supplied in the class they
[00:39:18] don't have the background knowledge that
[00:39:19] would be needed to do that so I think I
[00:39:21] don't know how that Vibes with with what
[00:39:22] you're doing but I think that's a a
[00:39:24] factor in learning that
[00:39:27] you know especially outside of that like
[00:39:29] here's the material what's the best way
[00:39:30] to study it but like here's your life
[00:39:32] what's the best way to be smart that I I
[00:39:34] think has was underrated by me and I've
[00:39:37] come to appreciate more and more just
[00:39:38] like you get understanding by having
[00:39:40] background knowledge that is not present
[00:39:43] in the thing that the explanation you're
[00:39:44] reading you know this is only
[00:39:47] comprehensible if you know some of the
[00:39:49] things that we're talking about like you
[00:39:51] know yeah yeah I think my my um
[00:39:53] listeners will probably find it pretty
[00:39:54] comprehensible cuz I I talk about these
[00:39:56] things
[00:39:58] there a CLE things IED to um add to like
[00:40:01] um the idea that um you know people that
[00:40:05] people that have expertise they read a
[00:40:07] lot yeah um and and that's completely
[00:40:09] true like they are interested they're
[00:40:10] intrinsically motivated like they've
[00:40:12] read they yeah like read widely they
[00:40:15] read deeply um and the thing that I'd
[00:40:17] add on to that is like the other
[00:40:19] ingredient is that they they think
[00:40:22] deeply about it as well the reason I add
[00:40:24] that on is because like I've got a a
[00:40:26] whole cohort of like PhD students or
[00:40:27] Master students that you know like they
[00:40:30] they read a lot like they honestly read
[00:40:32] a lot like a lot a lot and sometimes I
[00:40:35] just think like it's kind of pointless
[00:40:38] like what what is um limiting you right
[00:40:40] now is not the fact that you don't have
[00:40:42] enough input coming in is that like the
[00:40:43] way that you're thinking about that
[00:40:44] input is like far too superficial like
[00:40:46] they could read a rebuttal but
[00:40:48] essentially what they've said is like
[00:40:49] here's one argument and then this is the
[00:40:50] rebuttal like they're still just
[00:40:51] thinking about it in terms of like I
[00:40:54] understand this one I've now understood
[00:40:55] this one like
[00:40:56] it's still very superficial and so if
[00:40:59] you ask them like kind of a higher roic
[00:41:01] question around it like okay what do you
[00:41:02] think the implication of that rebuttal
[00:41:04] is for future research or like based on
[00:41:07] this interplay like what do you think is
[00:41:08] the research Gap or what do you think is
[00:41:10] like an assumption that was made by this
[00:41:12] that wasn't covered in the rebuttal but
[00:41:13] maybe that rebuttal like maybe indicates
[00:41:16] and they're not able to engage in that
[00:41:17] because they haven't actually done that
[00:41:19] kind of deeper more comparative thinking
[00:41:21] so one of the things that I often I'm
[00:41:24] like a really big proponent of and it's
[00:41:26] it's
[00:41:26] in a way like a recurring theme among my
[00:41:28] videos and and and the the techniques
[00:41:30] that I teach is whenever you're taking
[00:41:32] in any information like um there's this
[00:41:35] quote by some someone who I can't
[00:41:36] remember but they basically say like
[00:41:37] memory is a residue of thought and
[00:41:40] understanding that's yeah that's right
[00:41:42] yeah yeah willing willing him that's
[00:41:44] right yeah and um I I like that quote I
[00:41:46] think like understanding is the same
[00:41:48] like memory and understanding are
[00:41:50] residues of thought and so when we think
[00:41:53] about it that way it's like so what are
[00:41:54] the thoughts that create better memory
[00:41:56] and better and deeper levels of
[00:41:58] understanding um so one of the models
[00:42:01] that I often reference you know pretty
[00:42:02] pretty often not that I fully agree with
[00:42:04] it as Bloom's revised taxonomy yeah
[00:42:07] which has that kind of hierarchical um
[00:42:08] framework I'm pretty sure everyone
[00:42:10] that's watching my channel probably
[00:42:11] knows about it because I talk about it
[00:42:13] so much but I don't often talk about
[00:42:14] what the limitations of blooms is are
[00:42:16] like blooms is extremely hierarchical
[00:42:18] and the common way of looking at blooms
[00:42:19] is like you have to start at the bottom
[00:42:20] and work your way to the top and I think
[00:42:22] there's a lot of research in the last
[00:42:24] like 10 years that shows that that's
[00:42:26] that's really not the way that learning
[00:42:28] works authentically like authentically
[00:42:29] people are moving up and down that
[00:42:30] framework all the time and within a
[00:42:32] certain concept like it's not like you
[00:42:34] have one level and that's that's it like
[00:42:36] you can have like it's it's it it
[00:42:38] doesn't work that way and so applying
[00:42:41] that idea that memory and understanding
[00:42:43] is a resid residue of thought one of the
[00:42:45] things that I strongly encourage is
[00:42:48] whenever you take information in just
[00:42:49] try to operate at that higher order so
[00:42:51] that you are trying to simplify trying
[00:42:53] to apply trying to compare find trend
[00:42:56] similarities uh create analogies um
[00:42:59] evaluate the accuracy and significance
[00:43:01] of everything that you're taking in so
[00:43:03] that when things come in you're able to
[00:43:07] chunk it so that the more you read it is
[00:43:11] not I think most people like the more
[00:43:13] they read the more overwhelmed they're
[00:43:14] getting like there's a proportional
[00:43:16] relationship between the amount of
[00:43:17] information they take in versus the
[00:43:19] amount of um overwhelm and and cognitive
[00:43:21] overload they they suffer from and I
[00:43:25] think a big part of that is because
[00:43:26] their information processing is not
[00:43:28] allow allowing them to create a model
[00:43:31] and a schema that is chunked and well
[00:43:33] organized as they are reading and then
[00:43:35] that eventually gets to the point where
[00:43:37] like you know you've read like 50
[00:43:38] articles but you honestly just are like
[00:43:41] you know you like lost the will to live
[00:43:43] by now because you just you don't know
[00:43:44] what's going on anymore like you don't
[00:43:45] even know any like you know even less
[00:43:47] about it because of the fact that you
[00:43:49] know too much and it there's nowhere for
[00:43:51] it to um sort of sit yeah it's a good
[00:43:54] point you're raising I think my
[00:43:56] perspective on it and this is sort of a
[00:43:58] more Global Perspective I have on
[00:44:00] learning generally is that I tend to
[00:44:02] come from a kind of school of thought of
[00:44:04] like maybe more pragmatism or like
[00:44:07] functionalism like that learning is
[00:44:10] always learning for something and so I
[00:44:13] tended like you know there was I made a
[00:44:15] big chapter kind of about this in um in
[00:44:18] my book where I talk about directness
[00:44:19] where but it was basically this idea
[00:44:21] that
[00:44:22] like it's hard to learn for something if
[00:44:25] you don't know what you're learning for
[00:44:27] so like for me I feel like the biggest
[00:44:29] thing that helps me think more deeply
[00:44:31] when I'm doing reading and to not have
[00:44:33] it be that where I just like well here's
[00:44:35] the reading list and I got to go through
[00:44:36] it is is like I have a very active goal
[00:44:40] like there's a very strong purpose it's
[00:44:42] got like I'm not reading anything for no
[00:44:44] reason I'm always reading it for a
[00:44:45] reason and the reason um filters how I'm
[00:44:48] processing it and what's interesting is
[00:44:50] that like I don't tend to think of it so
[00:44:52] much of like well there's just a
[00:44:54] hierarchy of better and worse thinking
[00:44:56] it's rather that what I attend to is
[00:44:59] going to be influenced by that and so
[00:45:01] I've even had books where I've read it
[00:45:02] under a certain frame of mind where I'm
[00:45:04] trying to get something out of it or
[00:45:05] trying to understand it or trying to
[00:45:07] resolve a particular question and I read
[00:45:09] it and then I come back to the book like
[00:45:11] a couple years later from a completely
[00:45:13] different reference point it's like a
[00:45:14] different book it's like I'm reading I'm
[00:45:16] like oh this is the thing that I was
[00:45:18] like you know so you can cycle back that
[00:45:20] way and so for me like because I'm a
[00:45:23] writer because a lot of what I'm reading
[00:45:25] is going to end up in my writing I mean
[00:45:27] uh I don't remember the the person who
[00:45:29] said this but they made the comment like
[00:45:30] they were also a writer and they made
[00:45:32] the comment of like um when they read
[00:45:35] books they're reading it so that they
[00:45:36] can do like a book review and it's like
[00:45:38] if I'm not going to write a book review
[00:45:40] like if I'm reading it I'm like this
[00:45:41] doesn't Merit a book review then there's
[00:45:42] no point even reading the book and I
[00:45:44] just but I kind of like that like a
[00:45:46] review is not always your goal because a
[00:45:48] review itself is a kind of summarization
[00:45:50] it's a simplification often my goal is
[00:45:52] to like get an answer to a particular
[00:45:54] question like you know what is what do
[00:45:56] the leading experts think is this or
[00:45:58] what is what is the issue with this or
[00:46:00] what is like what is the boundary of
[00:46:02] this idea or this kind of thing and so
[00:46:04] it doesn't have to be for a review but I
[00:46:06] think the gold directedness of what I'm
[00:46:08] doing when I'm uh reading I think forces
[00:46:11] that deeper processing because every
[00:46:13] time I'm going to a text I'm reading it
[00:46:16] because like even if the because was
[00:46:18] like well you need to understand this
[00:46:20] idea because you don't understand this
[00:46:22] idea to make sense of something else
[00:46:23] like even if it's like as broad as that
[00:46:25] so I think this idea of like being able
[00:46:27] to construct a goal that's going to
[00:46:29] guide your processing when you're doing
[00:46:31] something um is a certain sense of skill
[00:46:34] that you have to acquire because in so
[00:46:35] many classroom contexts uh the goal is
[00:46:38] really well specified um up front and so
[00:46:41] when you're you know again you have this
[00:46:44] like I have this reading list but you
[00:46:46] know I can't tell you how many times I
[00:46:48] talk to students where I'm sort of like
[00:46:49] they're learning something I'm like well
[00:46:50] what are going to be the kind of
[00:46:51] questions you get on the exam and they
[00:46:53] just like blank face or just they just
[00:46:54] like I have no idea and it's like well
[00:46:56] then I can't help you you know if you
[00:46:58] have no idea what you're possibly going
[00:46:59] to be using it for then I mean any
[00:47:02] possible thing might be the right thing
[00:47:03] to focus on if you know if they're
[00:47:05] asking you to memorize the page widths
[00:47:07] of every single page then like that
[00:47:08] should be the thing you're paying
[00:47:10] attention to you know yeah no I I I love
[00:47:12] that I want to um share a little like
[00:47:14] kind of experience that I've had with my
[00:47:15] coaching and I want to get your um
[00:47:16] thoughts on it just it directly Builds
[00:47:18] on it a lot of the time when especially
[00:47:21] when I work with actually not just
[00:47:22] students I mean definitely I see it more
[00:47:25] with students and one of the good things
[00:47:26] about professionals is that usually what
[00:47:28] they're learning like it is
[00:47:29] fundamentally very go directed like it's
[00:47:31] um you could almost say it's somewhat
[00:47:34] utilitarian like how how they're
[00:47:35] learning um so there's that go Direction
[00:47:39] and lens in the first place
[00:47:41] but there are also a lot of situations
[00:47:45] where I'm thinking like ca CFA CPA
[00:47:49] examinations where like their course
[00:47:51] materials are going to test them on
[00:47:53] things that aren't necessarily related
[00:47:55] to their daily work because they're not
[00:47:57] actually in that department or uh
[00:47:59] medical like doctors entering into
[00:48:01] training training programs
[00:48:02] specializations where they have to learn
[00:48:03] like really detailed pathophysiology of
[00:48:05] things or like cyto kind Pathways which
[00:48:08] they honestly don't care about because
[00:48:09] like they're just operating and but they
[00:48:11] need that for their um their exam and
[00:48:14] obviously for students that are in these
[00:48:17] curriculums what I find is that there is
[00:48:19] a difference between what we cerebrally
[00:48:23] understand as being relevant and
[00:48:24] purposeful MH um and and and relevance
[00:48:29] that is
[00:48:30] actually significant enough that from a
[00:48:33] cognitive perspective it does actually
[00:48:35] allow us to encode that information more
[00:48:39] effectively so for example there will be
[00:48:41] a lot of students that say well I know
[00:48:42] that they're going to ask me these types
[00:48:43] of questions in the
[00:48:45] exam but when they consume that
[00:48:47] information it's still not more
[00:48:49] meaningful in a way because it hasn't
[00:48:51] actually created any more of a model
[00:48:55] like it it it is not more significant it
[00:48:57] doesn't feel more relevant it's kind of
[00:48:59] like a label of relevance like someone
[00:49:01] has just said you need to know it
[00:49:02] because you need to know it and so they
[00:49:05] still struggle like from a cognitive
[00:49:06] perspective with actually holding on to
[00:49:08] that information and so an angle that I
[00:49:10] look at it from is like yes we all know
[00:49:12] that learning is easier when it's more
[00:49:14] relevant how can we create that kind of
[00:49:17] same level of clear personal relevance
[00:49:21] even when objectively speaking it
[00:49:23] actually just is not that personally
[00:49:25] relevant like that high school student
[00:49:27] that yeah well I think I think I just
[00:49:30] sorry I'm interrupting a little bit but
[00:49:32] I think it's it's not to say that my
[00:49:34] process is like uh I like like sometimes
[00:49:39] I'll read a paper where it's like I'm
[00:49:41] just trying to get X from it like you
[00:49:42] know if I'm if I know I'm citing
[00:49:44] something that I've like I've already
[00:49:45] kind of read a summary of the research
[00:49:47] but I like I need to know exactly how
[00:49:49] they did the experiment so that I can
[00:49:50] write it up or something like okay I'm G
[00:49:52] to like skim right to the methods and
[00:49:53] I'm going to reread that part yeah but
[00:49:55] that's not usually how I'm doing it
[00:49:56] usually it's more from an operation of
[00:49:58] like uh it is a bit broader because in
[00:50:01] order to have that level of gold
[00:50:03] directedness you have to have a very
[00:50:04] clear picture of like what it is you're
[00:50:06] trying to learn in advance of learning
[00:50:08] it which is it's sort of a catch 22 like
[00:50:10] if you already knew exactly what you
[00:50:11] were looking for you wouldn't need to
[00:50:13] look for it you'd have found it right
[00:50:14] yeah and so yeah I think usually when
[00:50:16] I'm reading is is from a a little bit
[00:50:18] more of a perspective of like um this is
[00:50:23] important this is going to fit into
[00:50:26] uh sort of like my model of how things
[00:50:29] work or how things work in this domain
[00:50:32] in this sort of area and my goal of the
[00:50:36] reading is usually to be able to try to
[00:50:38] like again it's this is too broad a goal
[00:50:40] but the goal is sort of more like okay
[00:50:43] if I were to teach this uh as like a
[00:50:46] lecture like a course like I'm GNA have
[00:50:47] to give a class on this topic uh could I
[00:50:50] do it and so like there's a little bit
[00:50:52] more of a when I'm reading it like we
[00:50:54] don't know I don't understand why did
[00:50:55] you do this right because because I'm in
[00:50:58] my go directedness I know that I'm doing
[00:51:00] that whereas if it's sort of like no I'm
[00:51:01] just trying to get the information on
[00:51:02] page you know eight or something maybe
[00:51:04] I'm not going to do that so uh I mean
[00:51:07] I'm being a little handwavy here but I
[00:51:09] think you know again this writerly habit
[00:51:11] of you know if I'm reading a book that I
[00:51:13] think is important I'm like I'm gonna do
[00:51:14] a review of this book and I have that in
[00:51:16] the back of my head when I'm reading it
[00:51:18] changes the reading experience because
[00:51:20] it's sort of like well okay what like
[00:51:23] even in the back of my head you're like
[00:51:24] kind of doing a draft of article of like
[00:51:26] okay well I'm going to have to talk
[00:51:27] about this am I going to talk about this
[00:51:28] and this or is this a diversion or and
[00:51:30] like am I going to talk about this how
[00:51:32] am I going to explain this like how like
[00:51:33] he spent you know or the author spent 20
[00:51:36] Pages talking about this what's the
[00:51:38] essence of it or what's the point that's
[00:51:40] interesting and um and I mean that
[00:51:42] colors how I do it too because I'm also
[00:51:45] thinking of like what's going to be
[00:51:46] interesting what can I simplify that's a
[00:51:48] but that's what I'm saying about the
[00:51:49] task specificity that I talk to doctoral
[00:51:53] students for instance or I talk to
[00:51:54] researchers and they often read papers
[00:51:57] in a very uh I had one uh reader write
[00:51:59] to me about how like he was criticizing
[00:52:02] me for
[00:52:03] being uh for reading things with an like
[00:52:07] overly uh what's the word being like
[00:52:10] overly like credible about how these
[00:52:13] people are doing things like I am
[00:52:15] reading this and just sort of like well
[00:52:16] this is what the paper said and I'm just
[00:52:18] reporting it whereas his comment was
[00:52:20] that like the whole academic process or
[00:52:23] the whole thing that he is being like
[00:52:24] inculcated is to read things adversar
[00:52:27] like read things to be like this is the
[00:52:29] mistake they made this is the experiment
[00:52:31] that would actually prove it or this is
[00:52:32] what but to me it's not that one is
[00:52:35] right or one is wrong but just the sort
[00:52:37] of the end purpose of the the reading
[00:52:39] activity in his case is to produce a new
[00:52:41] paper that is going to contribute
[00:52:44] compete you know verify like do
[00:52:47] something in the academic literature I'm
[00:52:49] not producing academic literature my job
[00:52:51] is to kind of like well this is what the
[00:52:53] people who were the experts like I I
[00:52:55] understood what they said and I'm
[00:52:56] reporting on it now I might not believe
[00:52:58] a paper I might not like I'm well I'm
[00:53:00] not going to report on this I think this
[00:53:01] is false but it's uh it's from a
[00:53:04] different mindset and so I think again
[00:53:06] the difficulty of like a lot of students
[00:53:09] um is is that these goals are uh it's
[00:53:14] it's difficult to get someone to get
[00:53:15] these goals I think if they don't
[00:53:16] already have them and I think that is
[00:53:17] one of the like the strongest reasons
[00:53:20] why people like U you know John sweller
[00:53:22] and stuff are kind of skeptical of it
[00:53:24] because the PE the teachers that are
[00:53:25] trying to like well we want to inculcate
[00:53:27] like curiosity and passion and then you
[00:53:29] meet actual students and the majority of
[00:53:30] them in the classroom are like when's
[00:53:32] recess or like and it's you know it's
[00:53:35] like okay maybe that's a little
[00:53:36] idealistic but for you and I who are
[00:53:39] coaching people who presumably care
[00:53:40] about learning and want to learn better
[00:53:43] um I do think there's some time thinking
[00:53:45] about like how much the orienting
[00:53:46] activity how much the what is this for
[00:53:49] what am I looking at um even if it's not
[00:53:52] like a very conscious explicit process
[00:53:54] of like this is my note-taking strategy
[00:53:57] um just a way of like this is a way of
[00:53:59] reading this because I know this is what
[00:54:01] I'm going to be using it for later and
[00:54:02] trying to select those goals in a way
[00:54:05] that um is good for more purposes yeah
[00:54:08] yeah no I absolutely agree and and I
[00:54:10] think the orientating kind of activity
[00:54:12] the priming aspect of it was like
[00:54:13] incredibly powerful for helping people
[00:54:16] to build that um build the the mental
[00:54:18] model another thing that I'd add on to
[00:54:20] that is like I think something that that
[00:54:22] shouldn't be overlooked or
[00:54:24] underestimated is
[00:54:25] the impact that someone's just prior
[00:54:27] habits of learning can have on their
[00:54:30] experience of cons of taking in that
[00:54:32] information like someone who is used to
[00:54:35] being very goal orientated with their
[00:54:36] reading when you say when you instruct
[00:54:39] them like be even more goal orientated
[00:54:41] or like think of different types of
[00:54:42] goals or you know like they know how to
[00:54:43] do that whereas what give you an example
[00:54:46] like I recently got back from India and
[00:54:48] I did some Workshop tours and work with
[00:54:49] some of the universities there like
[00:54:51] thousands and I've got actually just a
[00:54:53] large cohort of students in India to
[00:54:54] begin with
[00:54:55] and when I work with some of the
[00:54:56] students there like there is actually
[00:54:58] like an ingrained culture where the
[00:55:01] learning is just by roote and repetition
[00:55:03] yeah like it it's actually just it's
[00:55:06] it's not just like oh it just happens
[00:55:07] like that is actually the standard
[00:55:09] advice given by a lot of places and if
[00:55:12] you don't do it that way like it's
[00:55:13] actually almost like frowned upon and
[00:55:17] and you sort of sort of as like an
[00:55:19] outcast or like you know you're crazy
[00:55:20] not not to do that and when I give these
[00:55:23] students instructions that for
[00:55:25] you know some other students it might be
[00:55:27] like very F like hey think about like
[00:55:29] why you might need to learn this here's
[00:55:31] some example exam questions like how you
[00:55:33] might be tested and even if we break it
[00:55:34] down like notice how this question it
[00:55:36] tests you on just like a fact but then
[00:55:38] this one really wants you to like
[00:55:39] compare the ideas and dissect it and
[00:55:41] like we go through that and then we say
[00:55:42] okay now I want you to read with that in
[00:55:44] mind knowing that that's how you need to
[00:55:46] apply your knowledge and then they read
[00:55:47] it like they still cannot actually form
[00:55:50] the model because they have just so
[00:55:52] little experience and so they don't have
[00:55:54] those habits and one of the things that
[00:55:56] I'm really interested in is like well
[00:55:57] what's the process when you take that
[00:55:59] type of student like what's the process
[00:56:00] where you slowly get them used to
[00:56:02] actually building that like actually
[00:56:03] what you said before like you need to
[00:56:05] have a certain level of background
[00:56:06] knowledge um to really make sense of
[00:56:08] things I think there's another thing
[00:56:10] like you need to have a certain level of
[00:56:11] background experience and skill at
[00:56:14] thinking in certain ways to be able to
[00:56:16] think in more variations of those ways
[00:56:19] well I want to I want to touch on a
[00:56:20] thing you said about um about being in
[00:56:23] India and having the
[00:56:25] uh like the lot the students very used
[00:56:28] to memorizing things by wrot and and
[00:56:30] that being very much in the culture and
[00:56:32] I know you uh also know about um I think
[00:56:35] it's David Gary who does the biological
[00:56:38] primary and secondary information and
[00:56:40] stuff but to me I think you know this is
[00:56:42] why I like the anthropologists even
[00:56:44] though they're often quite frankly kind
[00:56:46] of crazy when they're suggesting things
[00:56:47] that are just like you know the mind
[00:56:49] doesn't exist it's just culture right
[00:56:51] but but I the reason I like it is
[00:56:53] because you know if if you are working
[00:56:55] in like a psychology lab and you're
[00:56:58] testing these like you know like like
[00:57:00] sweller probably was like Australian
[00:57:02] junior high students or whatever you're
[00:57:04] getting this really narrow slice of
[00:57:05] humanity and no no disrespect to him
[00:57:07] that's just what you're doing whereas if
[00:57:09] you go to different cultures I think the
[00:57:11] the big lesson of anthropology is just
[00:57:13] like how different people are like how
[00:57:15] much cultural variation there is and
[00:57:18] that's even with the fact that like you
[00:57:20] know since uh you know since like the
[00:57:23] spread of Imperial whatever we've
[00:57:25] actually homogenized to c a considerable
[00:57:27] extent like you know ancient China was a
[00:57:30] lot more different from ancient Europe
[00:57:33] than modern China is right like C J ping
[00:57:35] wears a suit but I think the the thing
[00:57:38] that we kind of are missing is like how
[00:57:42] particular our environment is like how
[00:57:43] particular it is that we go to school
[00:57:45] for you know 16 years that like almost
[00:57:48] none of our ancestors did that like that
[00:57:49] we do tests and that we write them and
[00:57:51] that we read and like how many
[00:57:53] culturally specific institutions there
[00:57:54] are and so I think you know there's some
[00:57:56] claims about um Like Flint flect and
[00:57:59] intelligence as just simply being that
[00:58:01] just that like as we've increased
[00:58:04] education literacy and all these kind of
[00:58:06] things and nutrition and whatnot um
[00:58:08] there's been a like that to get a good
[00:58:12] IQ score you have to understand how
[00:58:14] tests work and you have to be motivated
[00:58:16] to do well on a test that's under time
[00:58:18] pressure and that if you're a hund
[00:58:20] gatherer in the serengetti just none of
[00:58:23] those things even make sense to you so
[00:58:25] like you're going to do poorly on that
[00:58:26] but it has nothing to do with your like
[00:58:27] innate cognitive faculties and so I
[00:58:30] think it was uh I think it was Barbara
[00:58:31] rogov who had some studies where was
[00:58:33] finding that like um I think it was in
[00:58:35] Mexico but she just found that people in
[00:58:38] these cultures were better at learning
[00:58:41] um without instructions like they were
[00:58:43] better learning just from observation so
[00:58:45] it would in this sort of apprenticeship
[00:58:47] kind of mode where like the the children
[00:58:49] would learn how to do some kind of
[00:58:50] household task without the adults ever
[00:58:52] explaining how to do it just by watching
[00:58:54] and that the children like paid
[00:58:55] attention more whereas Western children
[00:58:58] through schooling through kind of our
[00:59:00] culture were just expected to be told
[00:59:01] how to do it and they weren't paying
[00:59:02] attention quite as much on how to do
[00:59:04] that and I think it's relevant like what
[00:59:06] you're talking about the like maybe
[00:59:08] Indian Western
[00:59:09] distinction that I mean if you go back
[00:59:11] in Indian culture like memorizing The
[00:59:14] Vedas was like was the central scholarly
[00:59:18] activity like you go 4,000 years of like
[00:59:21] memorizing the words verbatim philology
[00:59:23] grammar like then entire culture was
[00:59:25] based on this kind of like this having
[00:59:27] an enormous significance of like not
[00:59:31] just understanding the concept but
[00:59:33] knowing the words exactly right which
[00:59:36] maybe is not there like I don't know you
[00:59:38] know the Iliad or whatever there was
[00:59:39] some bards who were memorizing poems in
[00:59:41] ancient Greece but I mean it doesn't
[00:59:42] necessarily have a caral eror here so I
[00:59:45] think you know culture has just an
[00:59:47] enormous influence on things and so I
[00:59:49] think for good and bad I I feel like
[00:59:52] when you talk to um when you talk to
[00:59:55] like again to use the Indian example
[00:59:57] like maybe there are some situations
[00:59:59] where Indian students are maybe overly
[01:00:02] relying on memorization like you know
[01:00:04] I've talked to Indian students where
[01:00:05] they get kind of frustrated because
[01:00:06] they're like well I could I can't use
[01:00:07] your tactic because they're expecting me
[01:00:09] to produce the definition of X verbatim
[01:00:12] on the exam and it's like well if you
[01:00:13] need it verbatim then flashcards and
[01:00:15] memorizing is the correct thing to do
[01:00:17] but I mean there's also a reason why
[01:00:20] like in the United States I think most
[01:00:22] of the people who have won spelling bees
[01:00:25] have come from India because they have
[01:00:27] this culture of of like this pedagogy
[01:00:30] this that's related to that and I think
[01:00:31] there's cultural differences here and I
[01:00:33] think it's just like you know so many of
[01:00:36] these background assumptions we have are
[01:00:38] embedded in the culture I think in
[01:00:40] Western culture there's probably like
[01:00:43] almost a romantic assumption about
[01:00:44] learning that like a lot of influence of
[01:00:47] rouso and dwey and this kind of stuff
[01:00:49] like you know when people talk about
[01:00:52] these like oh well the school where you
[01:00:54] just d real knowledge into these kids
[01:00:55] heads and there's no room for creativity
[01:00:57] and freedom I'm like like that wasn't
[01:01:00] the school that I went to I mean they
[01:01:01] they did did so little
[01:01:03] memorization uh like like you know they
[01:01:06] were like oh kids hate that they're
[01:01:07] never going to learn you know we did art
[01:01:09] projects and presentations and like
[01:01:11] that's what I remember Growing Up So in
[01:01:12] some ways like this this Mythos against
[01:01:15] like what traditional schooling is is
[01:01:17] like well it hasn't been like that for
[01:01:19] you know maybe ever but like even like
[01:01:21] hundreds of years it's been lots of
[01:01:22] influence of that so I think the culture
[01:01:24] impact is very important and so when
[01:01:26] you're getting into a a particular
[01:01:29] intellectual tradition or a particular
[01:01:30] like culture you know like like the
[01:01:33] adversarial mode of reading research um
[01:01:36] that is a higher order thinking ability
[01:01:39] but it is also very much a cultural
[01:01:42] trait it's very much a style that's uh
[01:01:45] that's imparted by being in a community
[01:01:47] where someone says well what the real
[01:01:49] like you you see this whenever you hear
[01:01:51] researchers say like the first thing to
[01:01:52] look at is the method section well the
[01:01:54] only reason to read the method section
[01:01:56] is because you're looking to figure out
[01:01:57] what's wrong with the paper rather than
[01:01:58] trying to understand what they were
[01:02:00] proposing right like it's a very much a
[01:02:02] strategy that's built around this is the
[01:02:04] goal of doing the research is to uh is
[01:02:07] like this intellectual chess game where
[01:02:08] you're trying to out with the opponents
[01:02:09] and and you know similarly to like like
[01:02:14] we should teach children to think like
[01:02:15] historians and like weigh evidence and
[01:02:17] like most kids aren't going to do that
[01:02:19] nor should they be but that is something
[01:02:20] that you need to do if you're a
[01:02:21] historian like that's what you should be
[01:02:23] doing is is doing that so I think the
[01:02:25] cultural attitude is important so when
[01:02:27] people talk about you know uh sweller
[01:02:30] these kind of people or they're talking
[01:02:31] about the biological primary secondary
[01:02:34] um I think part of the thing that's
[01:02:36] maybe missing from that is just like you
[01:02:38] know a lot more of it secondary maybe
[01:02:40] than we than we think like a lot more of
[01:02:41] like stuff that is taken for granted of
[01:02:44] like schools and these kind of things
[01:02:46] this really is secondary like it is
[01:02:48] something that just if you weren't in
[01:02:49] that environment you wouldn't learn yeah
[01:02:51] definitely and like the background
[01:02:52] knowledge that you you just accumulate
[01:02:55] from being in a certain Co like um you
[01:02:57] know we see this a lot when we look at
[01:02:58] studies around like International
[01:03:01] students and just just just
[01:03:03] crosscultural like people that have
[01:03:04] actually literally gone to another
[01:03:05] culture and like there's massive um
[01:03:08] adaptation problems that they have from
[01:03:10] having like the context of a previous
[01:03:14] coach's expectations and norms and
[01:03:16] background knowledge and and cultural
[01:03:18] you know capital and things and then
[01:03:19] going into a new one and like they have
[01:03:21] perfectly the right like cognitive
[01:03:23] abilities but like they just they don't
[01:03:25] understand like what is this coach's
[01:03:27] context of how they want that to be
[01:03:29] outputed yeah I think it's an important
[01:03:30] realization to make and um often it only
[01:03:33] happens in those situations where like
[01:03:35] you go into a radically different
[01:03:36] Scholastic or intellectual culture and
[01:03:38] then you realize oh wait no the way that
[01:03:41] I've been thinking about it doesn't work
[01:03:42] here and I'm struggling and I have to
[01:03:44] adapt and I have to like make explicit
[01:03:47] maybe all of the norms and rules that
[01:03:49] these people just picked up through
[01:03:50] osmosis you know I want to tie this back
[01:03:52] to sort of one of the themes we were
[01:03:54] about earlier which is just around the
[01:03:56] idea that I want to make sure that like
[01:03:58] to put on your words like it's not inert
[01:03:59] for the for the for the learner so it's
[01:04:02] like I mean just in your view like what
[01:04:04] are what are the things that kind of
[01:04:07] make the biggest difference for someone
[01:04:09] who like they don't have that background
[01:04:11] context they don't have these prior
[01:04:13] habits they are struggling they are
[01:04:16] putting you know often a lot of work a
[01:04:17] lot of effort a lot of time um a lot of
[01:04:19] sacrifice and that effort is not being
[01:04:21] met with either consistent or um
[01:04:25] proportional rewards because they can't
[01:04:28] just be like okay well I'm just going to
[01:04:29] take like a three-year pilgrimage across
[01:04:30] the world to like explore these and then
[01:04:32] like you know dedicate read like 50
[01:04:34] articles you know like I don't know I
[01:04:37] think I think my main this this is not
[01:04:40] like the most snazzy practical tip but
[01:04:43] my main advice that I tend to give
[01:04:45] people and I think it's very important
[01:04:46] because I think the
[01:04:48] motivational uh component of wanting to
[01:04:51] stick with something that's difficult is
[01:04:53] what people really struggle with with
[01:04:54] and I think one of the things that is
[01:04:57] like a real broad General lesson of of
[01:05:00] cognitive science of psychology is just
[01:05:02] how much um gaining more experience and
[01:05:06] having more like background knowledge
[01:05:07] incre like decreases the difficulty of
[01:05:09] doing a lot of these tasks and so like I
[01:05:12] think the it's a it's a kind of Faith
[01:05:16] you almost have to have and some people
[01:05:19] get it through just having like enormous
[01:05:21] success experiences in their youth and
[01:05:23] and whatnot but other people I think
[01:05:25] maybe you just have to take it as an
[01:05:27] article of faith that like the thing
[01:05:29] that you're finding really difficult
[01:05:30] that is is really hard that as you keep
[01:05:32] building the components as so like as I
[01:05:34] said like you know for background
[01:05:36] knowledge you're reading more of the
[01:05:37] things you're understanding more of the
[01:05:38] things for like procedural skills like
[01:05:40] math and whatnot you're drilling more of
[01:05:43] the component skills you're um
[01:05:45] understanding more of the component
[01:05:46] Concepts you're adding to your bag of
[01:05:48] tricks of like well I can make this move
[01:05:49] to solve this integral and I can make
[01:05:51] that move to solve this trigonometry
[01:05:53] problem that for like skills like
[01:05:55] languages and things like this that like
[01:05:57] the the individual chunks the perceptual
[01:05:59] pieces of like how many little bits it's
[01:06:01] broken up into are going to slowly
[01:06:03] cohere over time that as you build this
[01:06:05] it's going to get easier and easier and
[01:06:07] so I think this is a very difficult
[01:06:09] thing to believe in the moment that when
[01:06:13] you're in the process of learning
[01:06:15] something I think there is a sense that
[01:06:17] like you take it as granted as fixed and
[01:06:21] uh so I think maybe the thing that I
[01:06:23] would shout from the rooftops that I
[01:06:24] feel like I've learned personally and
[01:06:26] that is you know abundantly verified by
[01:06:28] cognitive science is just how much the
[01:06:31] individual transforms as they're on the
[01:06:33] Continuum of expertise that like you are
[01:06:35] the same person you are not any smarter
[01:06:37] there's no upgrade to your mental
[01:06:39] Hardware but by the end of the
[01:06:42] process uh you know you can speak a
[01:06:44] language fluently and produce long
[01:06:46] complicated sentences when before you
[01:06:49] could like barely like make a single
[01:06:50] utterance or you can quickly see how to
[01:06:53] solve a really diffult math problem when
[01:06:55] you know before you're like still like
[01:06:57] struggling to do the algebra or you know
[01:06:59] even just like a topic like okay I want
[01:07:01] to learn Neuroscience or PhD level
[01:07:04] economics or whatever and you're you
[01:07:06] open up the paper and you're like oh my
[01:07:08] God I don't understand anything and then
[01:07:09] it's just sort of like okay I take this
[01:07:11] little piece I figure out what this
[01:07:13] definition means I look it up I try to
[01:07:15] explain it I get a textbook I read this
[01:07:16] again like this process of digging
[01:07:18] deeper you're building building the
[01:07:20] foundation and eventually you just you
[01:07:22] read it and you're like like the person
[01:07:24] is the expert you're just like oh that's
[01:07:25] what they did wrong in the method
[01:07:26] section you know like that that's become
[01:07:28] used so I think there's lots of tactics
[01:07:31] and lots of things that we could talk
[01:07:32] about and certainly your work has been
[01:07:34] trying to navigate and accelerate that
[01:07:36] process but I think just believing that
[01:07:38] that process exists I think is hard for
[01:07:40] people so I think that's you know if
[01:07:42] there's any if there's anything that I
[01:07:44] would just like you know want to put the
[01:07:46] hand on the shoulder and say it would be
[01:07:47] that yeah yeah no I I I I fully agree
[01:07:50] and I I would actually say that um like
[01:07:54] you are actually upgrading your Hardware
[01:07:56] as well I mean you know because of how
[01:07:57] neuroplasticity works like at the end of
[01:07:59] the process like that transformation
[01:08:00] like you are actually like that that is
[01:08:03] it's a transformation it's not transient
[01:08:04] like you once you get that like
[01:08:06] everything you learn in that domain
[01:08:08] coming forward like it becomes easier
[01:08:09] and easier I love the fact that you said
[01:08:11] it because um there's something that I
[01:08:12] talk about all the time is I I call it
[01:08:14] order control because a lot of people
[01:08:15] are really fixed on thinking I need to
[01:08:19] learn everything in the same order it is
[01:08:21] presented to me I need to start at the
[01:08:22] beginning I need to end at the end I
[01:08:23] need go line by line I need to go par
[01:08:25] you know one chapter at a time and I
[01:08:27] need to understand everything in each
[01:08:29] paragraph before I move on to the next
[01:08:30] one like that's what they understand
[01:08:32] that's what you know sometimes they've
[01:08:33] been trained and and taught us the right
[01:08:35] way but actually you know I always say
[01:08:37] like if the text that you were given if
[01:08:39] the thing that you're learning from just
[01:08:40] happened to be starting from a point
[01:08:42] that was just more personally relevant
[01:08:44] and easier for you to understand you
[01:08:45] would just do it in that order and find
[01:08:48] it easier to understand so it's like
[01:08:49] don't don't assume that the information
[01:08:51] that's given to you and the way it's
[01:08:52] presented is like this is the only way
[01:08:55] to learn it if building those little
[01:08:57] blocks is what it takes and find the
[01:08:59] block that you feel that you can build
[01:09:01] and as you continue to build those
[01:09:02] blocks like things will get easier and
[01:09:05] that paragraph that previously you're
[01:09:06] like banging your head over for like 15
[01:09:08] minutes trying to understand you take a
[01:09:10] little bit of a detour and you come back
[01:09:11] to that paragraph later and and and now
[01:09:13] it's like 15 seconds like oh just it
[01:09:15] just makes sense because you've got so
[01:09:16] many more so much more background
[01:09:19] knowledge like background knowledge is
[01:09:21] not just like three years of like a dis
[01:09:30] just we layer that so I I like I
[01:09:32] personally really love the fact that
[01:09:33] that's the message that you decided to
[01:09:35] land on because I just think it really
[01:09:38] holds back a lot of people like and and
[01:09:41] it actually even affects them like
[01:09:42] emotionally because of the fact that
[01:09:44] they just think like learning is this
[01:09:46] impossible task it has always felt
[01:09:48] impossible they've never been good
[01:09:50] enough and like no matter how much
[01:09:51] effort they put in it just never seems
[01:09:53] to really
[01:09:54] translate it's like well it it it just
[01:09:57] it does translate but actually just how
[01:09:59] you try to translate it in the order and
[01:10:01] how you build it like yeah yeah there
[01:10:03] there has to be a little you know a
[01:10:04] level of Faith there definitely I love
[01:10:06] it but I I've loved the conversation
[01:10:08] it's been it's been awesome um I think
[01:10:10] it's a good kind of place to wrap things
[01:10:12] off scott did you have anything else
[01:10:13] that you wanted to kind of remark or add
[01:10:16] on or comment on at all if you enjoyed
[01:10:17] listening to us talk I It Be by all
[01:10:20] means check out my website Scott hen.com
[01:10:22] and uh and my book Ultra learning um I
[01:10:24] have another book coming out in May get
[01:10:26] better at anything so that'll also a lot
[01:10:28] of these conversations are a little you
[01:10:30] know from being immersed in the research
[01:10:32] for three years so you'll probably see
[01:10:34] Illusions to that if you're if you're
[01:10:35] getting that book in May and um and just
[01:10:38] uh you know it was great to talk to you
[01:10:39] Justin because I know we had been like
[01:10:41] orbiting uh similar spheres for a while
[01:10:45] and uh not having bumped into each other
[01:10:46] it was great to to talk to someone who's
[01:10:48] similarly passionated and opinionated
[01:10:51] about these topics yeah no it's been
[01:10:52] awesome thanks for your time cuz I've
[01:10:54] know I've known about you for ages you
[01:10:55] know and I knew about you as the
[01:10:57] bestseller author from day one that I
[01:10:59] that I knew you so it's oh thank it's
[01:11:01] awesome to have this have this
[01:11:02] conversation but yeah that's um yeah
[01:11:05] it's amazing thank you so much oh thank
[01:11:09] [Music]
[01:11:22] you
[01:11:23] [Music]


=== Understanding the nuances of study techniques ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYFgX3HPzkg

[00:00:00] one of the things that I see really
[00:00:01] often is when you don't understand the
[00:00:02] Nuance you don't understand the
[00:00:04] conditions necessary to make something
[00:00:05] work like you don't understand the win
[00:00:07] criteria and the only people that can
[00:00:09] not know the win criteria use a
[00:00:10] technique and still make it work are the
[00:00:12] people who have such a high level of
[00:00:14] deep processing that they can probably
[00:00:16] just use any technique and they will
[00:00:17] just somehow be able to make it work for
[00:00:19] them and these are the people that will
[00:00:20] like post their tips on Tik Tok and
[00:00:22] they'll say like hey this is the
[00:00:23] technique I use you know I'm like this
[00:00:24] top student just do what I do and you've
[00:00:26] got like millions of people that their
[00:00:28] only understanding is based on the fact
[00:00:30] that okay this top student did this it
[00:00:33] worked for them I don't know anything
[00:00:35] else about like how to make it work I'm
[00:00:37] just going to use it and they fully
[00:00:38] commit to it and if they don't do it
[00:00:40] then the only logical conclusion from
[00:00:41] this sphere of understanding is I'm just
[00:00:43] an idiot like I'm not smart enough I'm
[00:00:45] not capable and literally like every
[00:00:48] single day I have students that have
[00:00:49] been almost trained to believe that they
[00:00:52] are stupid yeah because of the fact that
[00:00:55] they don't understand the nuance


=== The harsh reality of why doctors burn out ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyf-GmPFtVo

[00:00:00] working overtime till 10:30 11:00 p.m.
[00:00:02] in another field is not the same as
[00:00:04] doing the same hours in medicine because
[00:00:06] like if you're on call for you know
[00:00:08] until 10:30 p.m. you're often like
[00:00:09] barely sitting you're constantly moving
[00:00:11] around your brain has essentially no
[00:00:13] rest so you're ruining your entire week
[00:00:14] and you're thinking well I got a couple
[00:00:15] hundred extra bucks for that and it's
[00:00:17] like okay that's that's cool and then
[00:00:18] you just think like do I really want to
[00:00:19] do that and I think when you first start
[00:00:21] you're like oh yeah like a little bit
[00:00:22] more money but at the end of the day
[00:00:24] like it's not really making much of a
[00:00:25] dent but then the impact that it has on
[00:00:27] your energy and your mental health and
[00:00:28] you know maybe you're not you haveen
[00:00:30] even recovered from your previous week
[00:00:31] let alone do you want to add to that
[00:00:32] debt and so I started thinking I just
[00:00:34] don't want to pick up these shifts
[00:00:36] pretty much ever


=== When you become a doctor for the wrong reasons ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b5lDpp9wbI

[00:00:00] I would rather be sick not even take a
[00:00:02] fake Sicky I would rather legitimately
[00:00:04] be sick to stay at home than go to work
[00:00:06] and I'm getting paid to go to work you
[00:00:08] know so I started thinking about like
[00:00:10] well this is essentially my life like
[00:00:11] this here is my life and yes when I'm at
[00:00:14] work I'm thinking oh it's not too bad
[00:00:16] like oh it's okay like oh this coffee is
[00:00:17] quite nice you know I made it to the end
[00:00:19] of the ward round and I get to do a few
[00:00:21] things during that day that I find kind
[00:00:22] of meaningful and like me personally
[00:00:24] there wasn't anything in medicine that I
[00:00:26] personally like loved there were a lot
[00:00:27] of little things that I thought oh it's
[00:00:28] pretty cool and I liked and there were
[00:00:30] little elements that I felt were quite
[00:00:32] fulfilling but as a whole I definitely
[00:00:34] wouldn't say that the job had anything
[00:00:36] in it that I felt like I really really L
[00:00:38] often I felt the sense of obligation to
[00:00:40] myself to try and love something to
[00:00:42] justify the fact that I was doing it


=== Day 3 of studying a text book in 3 days ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBccTThRPEI

[00:00:00] and on day three I'm going to go through
[00:00:01] the 800 Pages again but this time I'm
[00:00:03] focusing on just those details that I've
[00:00:05] missed will I have 100% retention and
[00:00:07] high level of Mastery across 3 days no
[00:00:10] if I was studying for an exam which I'm
[00:00:11] not would there be a problem potentially
[00:00:14] but if you're studying a 1,000 page
[00:00:16] textbook in 3 days for an exam where you
[00:00:18] actually have to do well that's another
[00:00:21] problem like you shouldn't be in that
[00:00:22] position but if I was setting an exam
[00:00:24] I'd probably get the best Mark I
[00:00:26] possibly could get given that I only
[00:00:28] studied for 3 days


=== This hack will improve your focus & efficiency ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGPrQVXew7w

[00:00:00] you want to schedule tasks and events
[00:00:02] during your day when you know you're
[00:00:03] going to be more focused and effective
[00:00:04] for that task I like to do more deep
[00:00:06] work that requires a lot of
[00:00:08] concentration in the mornings and I try
[00:00:09] to do more menial timec consuming but
[00:00:12] lower mental effort work during the
[00:00:14] evenings the only way that you can
[00:00:16] really figure this out though is to try
[00:00:18] it out yourself observe and experiment
[00:00:21] again


=== Overrated/Underrated: Waking up early ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLggA6S0o0M

[00:00:00] waking up early waking up early is super
[00:00:01] overrated so if you look at research
[00:00:03] around waking up early versus late you
[00:00:05] find that the effects are usually
[00:00:07] relatively short term it seems to be
[00:00:08] more the novelty of Changing Times where
[00:00:11] you have time available so early morning
[00:00:13] people if they start being nocturnal
[00:00:15] they get the same type of productivity
[00:00:16] Improvement as you would get from
[00:00:17] someone that normally wakes up late
[00:00:19] starting to wake up early but it then
[00:00:20] Fades so really the ideal way is to
[00:00:23] constantly fluctuate but who the hell's
[00:00:24] going to do that so basically just wake
[00:00:26] up whenever is a normal time for you to
[00:00:27] wake up and then not rely on waking up
[00:00:29] Ear to be the thing that changes your
[00:00:31] life


=== How memory works in your brain ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ua10Uc850

[00:00:00] the brain's ability to construct memory
[00:00:02] is something that we call encoding which
[00:00:04] depends a lot on the connections that
[00:00:07] you're able to make with new information
[00:00:09] when you build more connections you're
[00:00:10] able to retain it more and generally
[00:00:13] speaking when you've got more
[00:00:14] connections you also have more ways of
[00:00:16] using that knowledge for example like
[00:00:18] complex problem solving or more nuanced
[00:00:20] applications


=== Day 2 for studying a text book in 3 days ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRwG3D9aEdg

[00:00:00] on day two I'm going to go through the
[00:00:01] same 8800 Pages again and this time
[00:00:04] slightly different things are going to
[00:00:05] be more relevant for me different things
[00:00:07] are going to make more sense because I
[00:00:09] have more prior knowledge than I did the
[00:00:11] day before AKA today because I spent
[00:00:14] time to build a foundation so do you see
[00:00:16] as I learn more these anchor points are
[00:00:18] allowing the later learning to become
[00:00:20] easier so tomorrow I'll be going through
[00:00:22] another 800 pages but again maybe only
[00:00:25] 100 to 200 Pages worth of knowledge but
[00:00:27] I'm able to consume more because I have
[00:00:29] more reference points I have more anchor
[00:00:31] points there are more ways things feel
[00:00:33] relevant and there are more ways things
[00:00:35] feel interesting so from my brain's
[00:00:37] perspective it's easier to understand
[00:00:39] it's easier to process it's easier to
[00:00:41] make sense of and apply and ultimately
[00:00:43] easier to hold on to to retain


=== The power of analogies for retaining knowledge ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZSEZFDR6KE

[00:00:00] making analogies can be helpful because
[00:00:02] it boosts the number of connections that
[00:00:04] you can make with new information if you
[00:00:06] try it now you just take something that
[00:00:07] you've learned and you try to create an
[00:00:09] analogy out of it you'll notice that
[00:00:10] your retention and depth immediately
[00:00:13] start improving in fact even before
[00:00:15] you've even created the analogy just the
[00:00:17] process of thinking about trying to
[00:00:19] create an analogy will help with your
[00:00:21] retention and understanding but we
[00:00:23] cannot just create any old analogy and
[00:00:26] then just be done with it the True Value
[00:00:29] and Power of creating an analogy comes
[00:00:32] from trying to make it as simple and as
[00:00:34] Broad and accurate as possible


=== Overrated/Underrated: The second brain ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZqGHxtm6FM

[00:00:00] how about Thiago for's building a second
[00:00:02] brain program I don't know about their
[00:00:04] particular program but the concept of
[00:00:05] second brain is properly rated or even
[00:00:08] slightly underrated because second brain
[00:00:10] can be really useful for professionals
[00:00:11] especially or for you know like open
[00:00:13] book assessment type things I think
[00:00:14] people rely on second brain instead of
[00:00:17] having a first brain and that's where it
[00:00:18] becomes overrated you can't just paste
[00:00:20] it from your second brain into the exam
[00:00:22] if you don't have access to it so that
[00:00:24] becomes problematic that's the way a lot
[00:00:25] of people use edcas as well they almost
[00:00:26] use it as a second brain rather than
[00:00:28] augmenting their first brain


=== How do I study a text book in 3 days ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpi5oy6RYkQ

[00:00:00] I've got 900 pages of this textbook I
[00:00:02] still need to study in the next 3 days
[00:00:04] and I'm going to spend my time and
[00:00:06] effort on day one going through the
[00:00:08] entire 800 Pages Yes you heard me
[00:00:10] correctly I'm going to go through 800
[00:00:12] pages in a single day but the volume of
[00:00:14] information I go through is going to be
[00:00:16] the equivalent of maybe 75 Pages 100
[00:00:19] Pages it's still quite a lot but I've
[00:00:20] got 6 hours remember so I'm going to go
[00:00:22] through roughly let's say 100 Pages
[00:00:24] worth of actual knowledge but that's
[00:00:26] going to be the knowledge spread within
[00:00:27] this entire book that is the most Rel
[00:00:30] for me that makes the most sense it's
[00:00:31] the easiest for me to understand and
[00:00:33] wrap my head around that's going to
[00:00:34] create a lot of anchor points it's going
[00:00:36] to create a really strong schema a
[00:00:37] really strong foundation for me to start
[00:00:39] working from


=== The 10-minute memory method ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCqqkGUsNxo

[00:00:00] I have been around the block when it
[00:00:02] comes to learning and to be honest I was
[00:00:03] pretty useless in high school but since
[00:00:05] then I have studied medicine business
[00:00:08] education learning science and generally
[00:00:10] being able to perform consistently at a
[00:00:13] top level so I have learned some pretty
[00:00:15] useful tips and tricks along the way and
[00:00:17] being able to learn hyper efficiently
[00:00:19] now is probably one of my greatest
[00:00:21] strengths and it all started from
[00:00:23] learning how to think about information
[00:00:26] and learning in the Right Way Beyond
[00:00:28] repetition and memory policies and speed
[00:00:30] reading or whatever else is trending so
[00:00:32] what I want to share with you are some
[00:00:34] evidence-based methods that I have used
[00:00:36] for years to pretty much instantly boost
[00:00:39] my memory and that is not clickbait I
[00:00:41] legitimately use these methods like
[00:00:43] almost every day and I feel the results
[00:00:46] in seconds and if you use these methods
[00:00:48] you'll probably realize that your memory
[00:00:49] is better than you thought it was if
[00:00:51] you're new to this Channel and wondering
[00:00:52] who I am I'm Dr Jus s I'm a learning
[00:00:55] coach and head of learning at I can
[00:00:56] study I'm also a former medical doctor
[00:00:58] and I've helped thousands of people
[00:00:59] people learn to learn more efficiently
[00:01:01] it's actually my literal job by the way
[00:01:04] the YouTube thing is kind of more sort
[00:01:06] of on the side but for the last few
[00:01:08] years I've been sharing some of the
[00:01:09] things that I practiced and I've learned
[00:01:11] about on YouTube so there are actually a
[00:01:13] lot of ways that you can improve your
[00:01:14] memory but I'm going to focus on just
[00:01:15] two because I think they're kind of the
[00:01:17] two easiest and also they give you the
[00:01:19] most bang for buck and that they are
[00:01:20] pretty simple to use and they give you
[00:01:22] disproportionately good results before
[00:01:24] we jump in I would appreciate if you
[00:01:25] give this video a like the likes affect
[00:01:28] the algorithm which helps this video
[00:01:29] reach more people which motivates me to
[00:01:31] continue making more free content now
[00:01:33] quick disclaimer I'm not going to be
[00:01:35] talking about any methods that are
[00:01:38] involving repetition like flash cards
[00:01:40] even though repetition based learning
[00:01:42] can be effective and can help you it's
[00:01:44] not going to make as much of a
[00:01:46] difference as just not needing to repeat
[00:01:48] things as frequently in the first place
[00:01:50] and if we don't learn how to have a bit
[00:01:53] of quality of memory to begin with then
[00:01:55] it's very easy to get stuck on this
[00:01:57] hamster wheel of constantly needing to
[00:02:00] do repetition to keep up the first way
[00:02:02] which you're probably already familiar
[00:02:04] with is to create analogies but not in
[00:02:06] the way that you're probably used to a
[00:02:08] lot of people think that if you're a
[00:02:10] good learner you have a good memory and
[00:02:13] then if you're not a good learner then
[00:02:14] you have a bad memory and your memory is
[00:02:16] more like a leaky bucket but that is not
[00:02:18] really how your brain works memory is
[00:02:20] not really something that you have
[00:02:22] memory is really something that you
[00:02:24] construct rather than a warehouse to be
[00:02:26] filled it is more a building that you
[00:02:28] are constructing the quality of your
[00:02:31] memory is determined by the quality of
[00:02:34] the process that you used when you were
[00:02:36] thinking about the information in the
[00:02:38] first place it's like the residue of
[00:02:40] thought naturally if you don't build
[00:02:42] something very well then it doesn't last
[00:02:43] very long so if you have a bad memory it
[00:02:46] probably means that you're just
[00:02:47] constructing it poorly and the brain's
[00:02:49] ability to construct memory is something
[00:02:51] that we call encoding which depends a
[00:02:54] lot on the connections that you're able
[00:02:56] to make with new information when you
[00:02:58] build more connections you're able to
[00:03:00] retain it more and generally speaking
[00:03:02] when you've got more connections you
[00:03:04] also have more ways of using that
[00:03:06] knowledge for example like complex
[00:03:08] problem solving or more nuanced
[00:03:09] applications and I've talked about that
[00:03:10] in all of my previous videos and I
[00:03:13] usually talk about like entire
[00:03:14] strategies or ways that you can train
[00:03:16] your brain to to do that type of
[00:03:18] thinking a little bit better but this
[00:03:19] video is a little bit different because
[00:03:21] what I'm focusing on is a technique that
[00:03:23] you don't really need to even train to
[00:03:25] start using even though training is the
[00:03:27] best case scenario it does take time and
[00:03:30] there's things that we can do in the
[00:03:31] meantime while you train yourself so
[00:03:33] making analogies can be helpful because
[00:03:35] it boosts the number of connections that
[00:03:37] you can make with new information
[00:03:40] however there are some subtle nuances to
[00:03:43] applying this technique that make a big
[00:03:46] difference making an analogy is like
[00:03:47] building a bridge on one side you have
[00:03:50] new information that you've never
[00:03:52] encountered before and on the other side
[00:03:54] you have old familiar existing knowledge
[00:03:57] the analogy is what allows you to bridge
[00:03:59] between your existing knowledge to
[00:04:00] connect it with the new information and
[00:04:02] that just now was an analogy of an
[00:04:04] analogy and so when we create an analogy
[00:04:06] straight away we're adding a connection
[00:04:09] from existing knowledge to new
[00:04:10] information which makes it more relevant
[00:04:12] and that helps our memory it increases
[00:04:14] our retention increases the depth of our
[00:04:16] understanding if you try it now you just
[00:04:17] take something that you've learned and
[00:04:18] you try to create an analogy out of it
[00:04:20] you'll notice that your retention and
[00:04:22] depth immediately start improving in
[00:04:24] fact even before you've even created the
[00:04:26] analogy just the process of thinking
[00:04:28] about trying to create an analogy will
[00:04:31] help with your retention and
[00:04:32] understanding but we cannot just create
[00:04:35] any old analogy and then just be done
[00:04:37] with it the True Value and power of
[00:04:40] creating an analogy comes from trying to
[00:04:42] make it as simple and as Broad and
[00:04:45] accurate as possible let me give you
[00:04:48] some examples so previously I said that
[00:04:50] an analogy is like building a bridge
[00:04:52] between new information and old
[00:04:53] information and that's fine but this
[00:04:56] analogy doesn't really work when we
[00:04:58] start considering learning in instances
[00:05:01] where you're trying to learn very very
[00:05:03] specific technical dense information if
[00:05:06] you're trying to learn really technical
[00:05:08] information like the specific genetic
[00:05:11] defect that creates a mutation in some
[00:05:13] immune cell response or some very
[00:05:17] complicated specific reaction pathway
[00:05:19] and mechanism for some chemical reaction
[00:05:21] analogies are still helpful but it's not
[00:05:23] helpful because it's connecting directly
[00:05:25] to that particular fact which is very
[00:05:28] specific the way that analogies are
[00:05:30] helping is that it allows you to
[00:05:32] understand the surrounding Concepts a
[00:05:34] little bit more intuitively which then
[00:05:36] allows you to then make sense of that
[00:05:38] Heidi specific information a little bit
[00:05:40] more easier as well so to make the
[00:05:42] analogy more accurate we could say that
[00:05:44] making an analogy for learning is more
[00:05:45] like building a bridge from one known
[00:05:49] land to a new island and then building a
[00:05:53] camp on the shore it helps connect a new
[00:05:56] topic to what we already know as well as
[00:05:58] giving us a safe
[00:06:00] familiar home base from which we can
[00:06:02] explore the new island but now if we
[00:06:05] account for the fact that you don't
[00:06:06] always retain everything that you make
[00:06:08] an analogy for this updated analogy also
[00:06:11] starts to fall apart for example in
[00:06:13] learning we know that when new
[00:06:14] information has more connections to it
[00:06:16] and those connections are more
[00:06:17] meaningful we're more likely to hold on
[00:06:20] to that information our retention is
[00:06:21] better and our depth of understanding is
[00:06:22] better on the other hand if new
[00:06:24] information has fewer connections or
[00:06:26] those connections are very superficial
[00:06:28] then they're probably just going to fade
[00:06:30] very quickly anyway it may look like
[00:06:32] it's very connected but those
[00:06:33] connections weren't very significant and
[00:06:35] our brain is pretty good at pruning all
[00:06:37] of those off so we'd have to update our
[00:06:39] original analogy and we'd have to start
[00:06:41] considering things like the quality of
[00:06:43] the material that's being used to build
[00:06:45] the bridge and then the number of other
[00:06:48] known lands that are building bridges to
[00:06:50] this new island and now it's starting to
[00:06:52] get pretty complicated and at this point
[00:06:55] we may as well start thinking about a
[00:06:57] different analogy that actually
[00:06:58] encompasses all of these additional
[00:07:00] conditions for example I often talk
[00:07:02] about learning like solving a jigsaw
[00:07:04] puzzle making an analogy for learning is
[00:07:06] actually like taking a new piece and
[00:07:09] then checking where that piece fits in
[00:07:11] relation to the big picture that you
[00:07:13] know you're meant to form as we pick up
[00:07:15] each new piece we can then compare the
[00:07:17] pieces with each other to see how it can
[00:07:20] form this bigger image and whether the
[00:07:22] image we are actually forming with these
[00:07:25] pieces looks the same this actually
[00:07:27] reflects the reality of learning a lot
[00:07:29] more more closely and and you can see
[00:07:30] that from the literal process of trying
[00:07:32] to create an analogy for learning that
[00:07:34] I've been using as an example for this
[00:07:36] video we're not just saying here's a new
[00:07:38] island here's something that we know
[00:07:39] boom build a bridge and now it's
[00:07:41] connected in reality when we're
[00:07:43] exploring something new we don't even
[00:07:45] know what is on the other side we don't
[00:07:47] know what we know that is familiar to it
[00:07:51] because we don't know what is new we
[00:07:53] have to actually explore it first so as
[00:07:56] we gain each new piece of information we
[00:07:59] are constantly hypothesizing on the type
[00:08:02] of image and pattern that it forms we
[00:08:04] are constantly having to make a judgment
[00:08:06] about whether the picture we're forming
[00:08:09] actually makes sense or not and the
[00:08:10] really great thing about creating
[00:08:12] analogies in this particular way is that
[00:08:15] you don't have to stop learning until
[00:08:17] you craft the Perfect Analogy in fact
[00:08:19] it's not even possible to do that in the
[00:08:21] first place when we first start learning
[00:08:22] something and there's only like a few
[00:08:24] sentences to think about we might spend
[00:08:26] just 30 or 40 seconds to hypothesize a
[00:08:29] analogy that maybe could make sense and
[00:08:32] then as we continue to learn more we are
[00:08:35] constantly reflecting on the analogy
[00:08:37] that we're building seeing does it make
[00:08:38] sense do I need to update it do I need
[00:08:40] to change it and so that process that I
[00:08:42] just kind of walked you through before
[00:08:44] where we went through all these
[00:08:45] different you know analogy variations
[00:08:47] that took a few minutes that would
[00:08:48] probably be scattered across like a 20
[00:08:51] to 30 minute study session constantly
[00:08:52] just going back and forth and thinking
[00:08:54] about it and every time we go and try to
[00:08:57] update our analogy and think about
[00:08:59] whether it makes sense or not our
[00:09:00] learning is getting deeper our attention
[00:09:02] is getting stronger and our ability to
[00:09:04] use that information is becoming more
[00:09:05] nuanced now the reason I really like
[00:09:07] making analogies as a technique is
[00:09:09] because it is a pattern of thinking that
[00:09:12] most of us are actually familiar with If
[00:09:14] instead I said to you create a
[00:09:16] relational multi-level information
[00:09:19] schema using a importance-based chunking
[00:09:23] method of only the four most important
[00:09:25] chunks it takes a lot of training and
[00:09:27] practice to understand that and then to
[00:09:30] pull it off and although that may be a
[00:09:33] more effective and Powerful method of
[00:09:35] encoding and building memory it's not
[00:09:38] the easiest to use FYI if you're
[00:09:40] interested in learning all the advanced
[00:09:41] stuff then you can check out my full
[00:09:42] guided program at iid.com where you can
[00:09:44] learn all of that but when I say create
[00:09:46] an analogy we already know what that
[00:09:48] means we know how to think about that
[00:09:49] but cognitively it is actually a very
[00:09:51] complicated process when we're creating
[00:09:53] an analogy we have to take a new
[00:09:55] information analyze it evaluate it look
[00:09:58] for patterns and Trends in that and then
[00:10:00] try to find similar patterns and Trends
[00:10:02] and things that you already know of
[00:10:04] compare the two together hypothesize an
[00:10:07] analogy and then clarify and refine that
[00:10:10] to make it even more accurate and then
[00:10:12] simpler those are very complex higher
[00:10:14] order thinking patterns but we're a
[00:10:16] little bit more familiar with it which
[00:10:18] ultimately makes it easier to use so
[00:10:19] let's say we do this and we try to make
[00:10:20] our analogy as simple as possible as
[00:10:22] broad as possible and as accurate as
[00:10:24] possible where do we draw the line at
[00:10:26] what point do we stop trying to build
[00:10:27] that analogy for that one it's it's
[00:10:29] really up to you at some point it just
[00:10:30] becomes too hard to keep building that
[00:10:32] analogy and it's going to be impacted by
[00:10:34] your deep processing level probably by
[00:10:36] quite a lot if you want to learn a
[00:10:37] little bit more about deep processing
[00:10:39] then you can check out my video here my
[00:10:40] recommendation is that you just try your
[00:10:42] best to create the analogy and once you
[00:10:45] feel like you're hitting your limit then
[00:10:46] you can cut it off and then maybe look
[00:10:47] at starting a new analogy you don't have
[00:10:49] to create an analogy for every single
[00:10:51] thing that you learn but if you can make
[00:10:53] one or two big overarching analogies for
[00:10:56] the most important Concepts or group of
[00:10:59] Concepts or the overarching picture of
[00:11:01] how everything connects together in that
[00:11:03] entire topic that's going to have a
[00:11:05] massive effect on your ability to learn
[00:11:07] efficiently and hold on to the
[00:11:08] information what this does in effect is
[00:11:10] that it accelerates the ability for you
[00:11:13] to have the light bulb moment so that
[00:11:15] was the first one the second thing that
[00:11:17] we can do is to think to ourselves
[00:11:19] actively how can I make this easier
[00:11:22] learning as a s called desirable
[00:11:24] difficulty and it's difficult because
[00:11:26] that's the brain power you have to exert
[00:11:28] to get your brain to actually learn
[00:11:30] effectively and it's desirable because
[00:11:32] that brain power is directly allowing
[00:11:35] you to learn the information if you
[00:11:36] don't have desirable difficulty in
[00:11:38] learning it probably means you are
[00:11:39] learning passively which is like
[00:11:41] essentially a total waste of time
[00:11:42] because you can spend all day reading
[00:11:44] and studying but your brain's not
[00:11:46] actually doing the work it needs to
[00:11:48] encode the information so a week later
[00:11:50] you're going to realize that you
[00:11:51] remember nothing it's kind of like
[00:11:52] working out or going for a jog The
[00:11:54] Strain that you feel and the difficulty
[00:11:55] with breathing that's actually the whole
[00:11:58] point as it's not just something that we
[00:12:00] should accept but it's a sign that we
[00:12:02] are doing things in the right way now
[00:12:04] Studies have found that most people
[00:12:06] respond very poorly to that desirable
[00:12:09] difficulty they see it as a sign that
[00:12:10] they are learning in the wrong way so
[00:12:13] when I say to ask how can this be easier
[00:12:17] I'm not saying avoid that desirable
[00:12:20] difficulty it's not about spending less
[00:12:22] mental effort it's about being strategic
[00:12:24] with what we spend it on if I notice
[00:12:27] that this piece of information feels
[00:12:29] irrelevant and I have to repeat a lot of
[00:12:31] times I can feel like it's going to slip
[00:12:32] out of my mind any second now then I
[00:12:34] have to ask myself what would I have to
[00:12:38] know in order for this currently
[00:12:41] irrelevant piece of information to feel
[00:12:43] more relevant what do I need to know for
[00:12:47] my brain to find it easier to see where
[00:12:51] to put this new piece of information
[00:12:53] everyone knows that learning is easier
[00:12:54] when things are more relevant but
[00:12:56] relevance is not something that is
[00:12:58] assigned to to you at Birth like here's
[00:12:59] a list of all the things that you are
[00:13:01] going to find relevant until the day you
[00:13:03] die relevance is based on your
[00:13:05] experiences and your knowledge that you
[00:13:06] already have so if something feels
[00:13:08] irrelevant to you the right solution is
[00:13:11] to learn and gain the experiences or
[00:13:14] knowledge that would make it relevant
[00:13:17] and the reason is because your brain is
[00:13:18] extremely extremely good at removing
[00:13:21] information that it deems not relevant
[00:13:24] like you can never ever fight that if
[00:13:26] you're fighting a game where you're
[00:13:28] studying and what you're taking in feels
[00:13:30] irrelevant you will never be able to win
[00:13:32] and you're going to waste a lot of time
[00:13:34] and effort on trying to just cram it
[00:13:36] into your brain and there's a lot of
[00:13:38] repetition there so let me show you how
[00:13:40] it looks when you're leaning into your
[00:13:43] brain's own sense of relevance so I just
[00:13:44] got this Wikipedia article on the
[00:13:46] Ottoman Empire I just picked something
[00:13:47] that I know nothing about and here's
[00:13:49] what would happen when I'm studying this
[00:13:50] I might start by reading the first
[00:13:52] paragraph and I'm going to look for the
[00:13:54] things that feel irrelevant to me that I
[00:13:57] just don't know how to think about my
[00:13:58] brain obviously doesn't know why I'm
[00:14:00] learning this and for me like most of
[00:14:02] this is going to be irrelevant because I
[00:14:03] literally just picked like a random
[00:14:05] article on the front page of Wikipedia
[00:14:06] so the Ottoman Empire historically and
[00:14:08] colloquially known as the Turkish Empire
[00:14:09] was an Empire that controlled much of
[00:14:11] Southeast Europe West Asia and North
[00:14:13] Africa between the 14th and early 20th
[00:14:15] centuries the Empire also controlled a
[00:14:16] southeastern region of Central Europe
[00:14:18] from the 16th to the late 17th century
[00:14:20] look I don't know about you but I'm like
[00:14:22] bored already from reading that which
[00:14:24] means this is a great example so when I
[00:14:26] look at this even in that first C
[00:14:29] there is already stuff that I feel like
[00:14:31] why do I need to care like my brain
[00:14:33] clearly doesn't know what the relevance
[00:14:35] of this information is so again I say
[00:14:37] well how could I make this easier what
[00:14:38] would I need to know in order for this
[00:14:41] to feel more relevant the Ottoman Empire
[00:14:43] historically and Cally known as the
[00:14:44] Turkish Empire like even that statement
[00:14:47] I feel like if I knew stuff about the
[00:14:49] Turkish Empire to begin with then I
[00:14:52] might find this a little bit more
[00:14:55] interesting and so what I did is I just
[00:14:57] went and Googled
[00:14:59] what are some interesting facts about
[00:15:01] the Turkish Empire which eventually
[00:15:03] actually just led me to a page that was
[00:15:06] about the Ottoman Empire but I thought
[00:15:08] hey well okay well I'm on this page
[00:15:09] anyway let me learn some interesting
[00:15:11] facts and then there were a bunch of
[00:15:12] different facts here you can pause the
[00:15:13] video to scroll through this if you like
[00:15:15] but I personally didn't find it
[00:15:16] particularly interesting but for
[00:15:18] whatever reason I found this thing about
[00:15:20] the Janice series kind of interesting I
[00:15:22] don't know if it's because I've just
[00:15:23] played too many combat games but I just
[00:15:25] thought this was kind of cool so I read
[00:15:27] a very brief amount about this Ottoman
[00:15:30] Empire boasted a formidable military
[00:15:32] force blah blah blah Janis series Elite
[00:15:34] infantry Force composed of slave
[00:15:36] soldiers originally Christian boys taken
[00:15:39] captive from conquered territories like
[00:15:41] that's interesting they were renowned
[00:15:42] for their combat skills blah blah so I
[00:15:45] was like okay janisar sound kind of
[00:15:47] interesting like that's literally all I
[00:15:48] read very very quick skim so then I
[00:15:51] searched in Wikipedia about Janis series
[00:15:52] and I found this article about Janis
[00:15:54] series and again I spent like 25 seconds
[00:15:56] reading this Elite Infantry unit formed
[00:15:59] the ottoman Sultans household troops the
[00:16:01] first modern standing army in Europe
[00:16:04] established under Sultan Oran during the
[00:16:05] viser ship of Aladdin and uh at that
[00:16:08] time I thought is this what Aladdin the
[00:16:11] Disney character is named after so I
[00:16:13] looked him up and I couldn't find
[00:16:14] anything I did a quick Google search I
[00:16:15] didn't find anything that took like 30
[00:16:17] seconds and then I didn't know what a
[00:16:18] vazir was so I searched for vizir and I
[00:16:20] found that it's basically the leader and
[00:16:22] that wasn't very interesting to me and
[00:16:24] then I thought about this particular
[00:16:26] thing which said that they formed the
[00:16:28] first modern standing army in Europe and
[00:16:30] see I in the back of my mind I thought
[00:16:34] that the Roman army created by Alexander
[00:16:36] the Great was the first like standing
[00:16:39] army in Europe so I looked that up I was
[00:16:41] like Janis versus Roman army first Army
[00:16:43] what I found just from Reading literally
[00:16:45] the excerpts on here was that Jan is the
[00:16:48] first and only standing Army Corps in
[00:16:50] history after the Roman Empire so I went
[00:16:53] back to the Wikipedia article and I
[00:16:54] noticed that it said modern standing
[00:16:57] army and I looked at the images and I
[00:16:59] saw that they have you know bows and
[00:17:00] arrows and you scroll down a little bit
[00:17:02] and this guy's got a gun so I said ah
[00:17:05] okay so this is the first standing army
[00:17:08] that is modern and that gave me a little
[00:17:10] bit more information and now I've got a
[00:17:12] better understanding and I'm just
[00:17:14] inherently more interested about the
[00:17:16] Ottoman Empire because of that like I've
[00:17:17] just formed more knowledge about that
[00:17:19] when someone says to me Ottoman Empire
[00:17:22] I'm not just like what is that why do I
[00:17:24] need to care I can think Janis series
[00:17:27] like first modern standing army they had
[00:17:30] the bows and arrows and then they had
[00:17:31] the guns and I'm thinking they were this
[00:17:33] Elite Force so now when I read they
[00:17:36] controlled much of Southeast Europe West
[00:17:38] Asia North Africa between the 14th and
[00:17:40] 20th centuries the second paragraph here
[00:17:41] where it says after 1354 the Ottomans
[00:17:43] crossed into Europe and with the
[00:17:44] conquest of the Balkans the ottomate Bic
[00:17:47] was transformed into a transcontinental
[00:17:49] Empire and now when I read this it's
[00:17:51] like it makes more sense now that they
[00:17:53] controlled so much stuff because they
[00:17:55] had an Elite Force they had the first
[00:17:57] Army and the question that I had was
[00:17:59] like okay well what would I need to know
[00:18:02] to make this stuff feel more relevant
[00:18:05] and I just decided that if I knew the
[00:18:07] significance of the bulans I would
[00:18:09] probably find this a little bit more
[00:18:10] relevant like I'd be like oh the bulans
[00:18:13] like no wonder once they conquer the
[00:18:14] bans like of course they can become a
[00:18:16] transcontinental Empire so I just
[00:18:19] clicked on the link and then I got taken
[00:18:20] to the page about the bans honestly like
[00:18:22] wasn't very helpful and again I'm skim
[00:18:24] reading this I'm sure if I read this
[00:18:25] whole page I would have figured it out
[00:18:26] but I just spent like 15 seconds to skim
[00:18:29] the page and be like do I get an
[00:18:30] understanding for it not really I
[00:18:33] basically just figured out where it is
[00:18:34] on a map so I gave up on this page and I
[00:18:37] just searched why were the bokan
[00:18:39] significant for the Ottoman Empire and
[00:18:42] literally just in this like these two
[00:18:45] things I got the answer it just said the
[00:18:46] importance of the buan peninsul lane is
[00:18:48] geographic location situated at the
[00:18:50] crossroads of three major Empires and
[00:18:52] with access to several important
[00:18:53] waterways as bulans were strategically
[00:18:55] vital so like now I get it like it's a
[00:18:57] cross roads it controls a lot of the
[00:19:00] waterways like I can understand that now
[00:19:02] so now I know a little bit more about
[00:19:04] the Balkans and maybe if one day I learn
[00:19:06] about like Russian or austr Hungarian
[00:19:08] history the bans might come up again and
[00:19:10] I'm like oh yeah I know about the bans
[00:19:12] and so now that's more relevant for me
[00:19:13] so when I read this and I read that they
[00:19:15] conquered the bulans I'm like yeah
[00:19:17] they've unlocked like the gateway to the
[00:19:19] waterways like they're on the road now
[00:19:21] and with their Elite janary Army they're
[00:19:24] going to go on to become a
[00:19:25] transcontinental Empire so I now feel a
[00:19:28] lot more confident about the Ottoman
[00:19:29] Empire and I'm more interested in it do
[00:19:32] I know anything about it not really am I
[00:19:34] a history buff now not really but I feel
[00:19:38] like I'm more invested and I'm more
[00:19:40] interested so when I did that
[00:19:42] exploration it took literally like 2 and
[00:19:45] a half minutes of exploration like I was
[00:19:47] reading it and then I was Googling stuff
[00:19:49] and just very quickly skim reading some
[00:19:51] pages just looking for things here and
[00:19:53] there doing a few Google searches it
[00:19:54] didn't take long to do that exploring
[00:19:57] and 2 and a half minutes may seem like a
[00:19:59] long time to get through like
[00:20:00] essentially one paragraph but all of
[00:20:03] that work is forming a great foundation
[00:20:05] for all of my future learning going
[00:20:07] forward and then as I continue to learn
[00:20:08] more and more there are more things that
[00:20:10] add to my Foundation of relevance and
[00:20:12] there are less things that I'm going to
[00:20:14] need to go and explore because I've
[00:20:16] already know more stuff there's more
[00:20:18] things in my Foundation I'm not learning
[00:20:20] a bunch of really specialized technical
[00:20:23] you know detailed information I'm just
[00:20:25] building some relevant anchor points
[00:20:28] that I can then leverage for all my
[00:20:30] future learning and it might kind of
[00:20:32] seem like a very ADHD way of learning
[00:20:35] like just constantly going everywhere
[00:20:36] but leaning into your brain's internal
[00:20:39] sense of what is and is not relevant is
[00:20:41] a crucial skill for learning it's going
[00:20:43] to make learning so much not only easier
[00:20:47] but more enjoyable now if you do find
[00:20:49] that when you do this you like go way
[00:20:51] off track and just dive down like a
[00:20:53] rabbit hole for 15 20 30 minutes then
[00:20:56] very quick tip that I can give you is
[00:20:58] just set a timer 2 minutes at most for
[00:21:01] each little exploratory Adventure once
[00:21:03] the 2 minutes are done come back to your
[00:21:05] main text and just keep moving on you'll
[00:21:07] find that by taking these one or 2
[00:21:08] minute detours when you're learning
[00:21:10] every 5 or 10 minutes you can invest a
[00:21:13] small amount of time but it pays itself
[00:21:15] back with efficiency gains you're going
[00:21:18] to improve your focus it's going to be
[00:21:20] more engaging you're going to be more
[00:21:21] curious about it and you'll see a
[00:21:23] probably instantaneous increase in your
[00:21:26] retention the caveat is that you can't
[00:21:27] really do this with someone is talking
[00:21:28] to you like in a lecture or a class this
[00:21:30] particular thing is limited to
[00:21:31] self-study there are other things that
[00:21:33] you can do during class to make it you
[00:21:35] know less overwhelming but we're not
[00:21:37] going to cover those in this video I do
[00:21:39] have other videos talking about that in
[00:21:40] fact in general of course that's not all
[00:21:42] there is to learning learning is a very
[00:21:44] complicated thing if you're interested
[00:21:46] in learning a little bit more about all
[00:21:47] the other aspects of learning that you
[00:21:49] could work on then just stick around to
[00:21:50] the end I've got a playlist that I think
[00:21:52] is a good place for you to start with so
[00:21:54] those are two pretty simple ways that
[00:21:55] you can immediately improve your memory
[00:21:58] and something that I've been using for
[00:21:59] years if you find it too hard just do
[00:22:01] your best because even if you suck at it
[00:22:04] right now just doing it is going to give
[00:22:06] you some benefits and it may not be as
[00:22:08] good as it will be one day when you've
[00:22:11] practiced it a little bit more but it's
[00:22:13] still going to be better than not doing
[00:22:15] it so give it a go let me know how you
[00:22:16] find it in the comments and check out
[00:22:18] the playlist at the end of the video for
[00:22:20] my curated collection on how to become a
[00:22:22] more efficient learner or if you want an
[00:22:24] even easier and smoother way of becoming
[00:22:26] a Super learner then I've got a fully
[00:22:28] guided program at ien study.com it is a
[00:22:31] decade of my experience working with
[00:22:33] Learners to become more efficient to
[00:22:35] still down into a step-by-step program
[00:22:38] with Q&A and feedback and interactive
[00:22:40] challenges you can find a link to that
[00:22:41] in the description as well anyway thank
[00:22:42] you all so much for watching hope you
[00:22:44] enjoyed it and I'll see you next

=== Asians often struggle to leave the "doctor" trap ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck6bPi6Ph6w

[00:00:00] we are really limited especially in
[00:00:01] medicine because it's a one track way of
[00:00:03] thinking and I think especially Asian
[00:00:05] immigrants because there's a culture of
[00:00:07] kind of just being on the track or just
[00:00:09] Asians in general you can be a lot more
[00:00:11] creative with how you can make a
[00:00:13] difference like healthcare is so complex
[00:00:15] in so many things there's always
[00:00:17] something there and if there isn't you
[00:00:18] can look outside of healthcare as well
[00:00:20] you know cuz the skills you learn as a
[00:00:21] doctor are frankly extremely
[00:00:23] transferable is it it's very trans your
[00:00:25] domain specific knowledge may not
[00:00:27] directly be but the Frameworks used for
[00:00:29] thinking the concept oasian reasoning
[00:00:31] that you learn and diagnostic reasoning
[00:00:32] critical thinking skills being able to
[00:00:33] find patterns and correlate that with
[00:00:35] problem solving being like systematic
[00:00:37] having high work ethic having tolerance
[00:00:39] for high work capacity being
[00:00:41] hyperproductive self-regulation these
[00:00:42] are things that are extremely rare for
[00:00:45] employees to find and let me tell you as
[00:00:47] someone that has done a lot of
[00:00:48] interviews for trying to hire people the
[00:00:50] skills uh and the knowledge Gap that
[00:00:52] someone has is unless you're going for
[00:00:54] like a high high position is nowhere
[00:00:56] near as important as the attributes that
[00:00:57] you're bringing to it


=== The BIGGEST reason why you can't focus ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBeU0_ar3a4

[00:00:00] short form videos and social media are
[00:00:01] training our ability to focus to become
[00:00:04] shorter and shorter and shorter and a
[00:00:05] big part of staying focused especially
[00:00:07] over a long period of time is how much
[00:00:09] effort your brain needs to exert to keep
[00:00:12] your brain on task now unfortunately in
[00:00:15] this distraction free world it's
[00:00:18] probably not enough if you just have a
[00:00:21] great attention span and nothing else
[00:00:23] but it does make everything easier


=== Overrated/Underrated: Open book exams ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJI38EXaboo

[00:00:00] open book exams open book exams I'm
[00:00:02] going to say like for goodness of
[00:00:03] education is underrated massively
[00:00:05] underrated because it's more realistic
[00:00:07] to how you actually need to access
[00:00:09] information and it means that it places
[00:00:10] pressure on higher order learning rather
[00:00:13] than just memorizing stuff because you
[00:00:15] know that you'll just have to look that
[00:00:16] up the problem is people don't know how
[00:00:17] to study in that way


=== Why non-linear note-taking is so effective ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsm3HlhgWzo

[00:00:00] a lot of people say that I'll write my
[00:00:01] notes first and then I'll do all of this
[00:00:03] thinking and connecting and everything
[00:00:04] later but if all of the meaningful
[00:00:07] learning is being done later then you're
[00:00:09] probably going to run out of time and
[00:00:11] it's also just unnecessary extra work
[00:00:13] for yourself one of the other really
[00:00:15] awesome things about nonlinear note
[00:00:17] taking is that you can express a lot
[00:00:20] with just the arrangement and the arrows
[00:00:22] and the spacing on a page like you know
[00:00:24] those times where you're trying to
[00:00:25] explain something to someone and you're
[00:00:27] explaining it and then you're just like
[00:00:29] ah forget let me just show you instead
[00:00:31] it's kind of like the same thing with
[00:00:33] note taking it's usually better to show
[00:00:35] rather than explain with like an extra
[00:00:38] couple hundred words


=== This technique completely changed my learning ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr3dTtDx2oE

[00:00:00] this is a set of notes that I did for
[00:00:01] part of my masters of education it's
[00:00:03] literally hundreds of pages worth of
[00:00:06] textbook and journal articles and it was
[00:00:08] enough for me to get 100% in my paper in
[00:00:10] fact I was the first person to ever get
[00:00:12] 100% in that paper so as soon as I start
[00:00:15] to think non linearly a lot of things
[00:00:17] change about how I process the
[00:00:19] information instead of focusing on just
[00:00:21] getting the information down I'm now
[00:00:23] focusing on what does it mean how does
[00:00:26] it connect how does it relate to what
[00:00:28] I've already got where where do I place
[00:00:30] it how important is it this is called
[00:00:34] higher order learning and it directly
[00:00:36] translates into better retention and
[00:00:39] deeper understanding


=== How To UPGRADE iPad Note Taking (With Science) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntaO3-n-isc

[00:00:00] I am a tree's best friend because for
[00:00:02] the last 12 years I've been taking notes
[00:00:04] almost exclusively on my tablet there's
[00:00:06] nothing special about that there's lots
[00:00:08] of people that take notes on their
[00:00:10] tablet but the way that I write notes
[00:00:12] has allowed me to achieve the top
[00:00:14] ranking Mark in my cohort while spending
[00:00:16] a fraction of the time studying compared
[00:00:18] to everyone else in this video I'm going
[00:00:20] to go through how to use an iPad to
[00:00:21] write notes in the most cognitively
[00:00:24] effective way possible based on real
[00:00:26] evidence-based learning science and the
[00:00:28] way that a lot of people write notes
[00:00:30] using an iPad that actually cripples the
[00:00:32] iPad's ability to help you if you are
[00:00:35] new to this channel welcome I'm Dr
[00:00:36] Justin Sun I'm a learning coach and the
[00:00:38] head of learning at ien study for the
[00:00:40] last decade I've helped thousands of
[00:00:41] Learners from around the world learn
[00:00:43] more efficiently during that time I have
[00:00:45] spoken and lectured at universities and
[00:00:47] for corporates all around the world and
[00:00:50] note taking is consistently something
[00:00:54] that is almost never properly taught and
[00:00:57] learning to do it right can make a huge
[00:00:59] difference before we jump into it I'd
[00:01:01] appreciate if you give this video a like
[00:01:03] every like helps to push this video out
[00:01:05] to more people so that I can keep making
[00:01:07] more content for free for starters let's
[00:01:09] look at some really absolutely atrocious
[00:01:13] note taking without using an iPad and
[00:01:15] I'll explain exactly what's wrong with
[00:01:16] it by recognizing what's bad then you
[00:01:19] can see how an iPad could potentially
[00:01:21] help you as well as how you could also
[00:01:24] just make the exact same mistakes on an
[00:01:27] iPad so here's an example of some notes
[00:01:29] that I think I just absolute
[00:01:31] garbage the person writing these notes
[00:01:34] obviously had no idea what they were
[00:01:37] doing they probably spent all their time
[00:01:40] studying and had no
[00:01:42] life I mean very very wordy look at
[00:01:48] that this person was I can guarantee an
[00:01:52] absolute loser how do I know this
[00:01:55] because these are my notes from 10 years
[00:01:57] ago and I can tell you that that is
[00:01:59] completely true this is back in the time
[00:02:01] when I was trying to enter into medical
[00:02:03] school and I was just like a clueless
[00:02:05] amoeba about learning I knew absolutely
[00:02:07] nothing uh and I miraculously ended up
[00:02:09] getting into medical school so what is
[00:02:11] actually wrong with these types of notes
[00:02:13] so first of all as you can see it is
[00:02:16] very linear I've talked about this a lot
[00:02:19] of my other videos but linear note
[00:02:20] taking just does not work it takes a lot
[00:02:22] of time you write a lot and it's just
[00:02:25] not very good for memory and
[00:02:26] understanding I've got some pictures and
[00:02:28] I've got some drawings here and there
[00:02:30] but overall it's very isolated
[00:02:32] everything is just you know again fairly
[00:02:34] linear and the reason is that true
[00:02:37] knowledge is not linear true expertise
[00:02:40] is not linear for example back when I
[00:02:41] was a doctor not that I was really
[00:02:44] actually an expert but I would be able
[00:02:46] to use my knowledge in lots of different
[00:02:48] ways for example if someone came in with
[00:02:50] a headache I knew how to think about
[00:02:52] that I knew what questions to ask what
[00:02:54] information I needed what pieces were
[00:02:56] missing and I knew the importance of
[00:02:59] that new piece of information if they
[00:03:00] said they had a headache but they also
[00:03:02] had you know dizziness I knew how to
[00:03:04] relate those things together and form a
[00:03:07] conclusion however when an expert has to
[00:03:10] teach something that knowledge has to
[00:03:12] become linear because there is no other
[00:03:15] way to teach that knowledge you can't
[00:03:17] read multiple sentences at the same time
[00:03:20] you can't hear multiple lines being
[00:03:22] spoken at the same time the human brain
[00:03:25] needs to have sensory information one at
[00:03:27] a time so linearity is a necessary evil
[00:03:31] of all teaching and learning even if I
[00:03:33] showed you a map of a topic that looks
[00:03:36] very nonlinear if you looked at it you
[00:03:38] wouldn't actually know where to start
[00:03:40] you still need to have someone point out
[00:03:42] you know where things go you know it
[00:03:43] would be too hard to follow but the
[00:03:45] important thing is that even though
[00:03:46] teaching and learning has to be linear
[00:03:49] you as a learner have to reconstruct
[00:03:52] that knowledge into the nonlinear
[00:03:56] network of expertise rather than just
[00:03:59] trying to commit the imperfect linear
[00:04:02] version and with linear note taking it
[00:04:05] is very very hard to represent a network
[00:04:09] and relationships as a quick example
[00:04:12] here is a nonlinear set of notes for
[00:04:15] some of the basic principles of learning
[00:04:16] science and then here is the exact same
[00:04:19] amount of data and relationships
[00:04:22] actually not even all of the
[00:04:24] relationships expressed through just
[00:04:26] words you can see that one is a clean
[00:04:29] and organized nice structure and then
[00:04:31] the other one is like trying to decipher
[00:04:32] the matrix by looking at that green wall
[00:04:35] of code on the monitor you can see how
[00:04:37] much more memorable the nonlinear
[00:04:38] version is especially for me since I'm
[00:04:41] the one that had to think about how to
[00:04:44] actually represent it so it makes more
[00:04:47] sense for me the Creator than for you
[00:04:49] who is just seeing the final product and
[00:04:51] that example is just working with a few
[00:04:53] Concepts and not even going that in
[00:04:55] depth as another example this is a set
[00:04:57] of notes that I did for part of my
[00:04:58] masters of education it's literally
[00:05:01] hundreds of pages worth of textbook and
[00:05:04] journal articles and it was enough for
[00:05:06] me to get 100% in my paper in fact I was
[00:05:08] the first person to ever get 100% in
[00:05:10] that paper and it might seem
[00:05:11] unbelievable but there is actually a lot
[00:05:13] of very intricate Nuance packed into the
[00:05:16] arrangement of those notes so as soon as
[00:05:18] I start to think nonlinearly a lot of
[00:05:21] things change about how I process the
[00:05:22] information instead of focusing on just
[00:05:24] getting the information down I'm now
[00:05:27] focusing on what does it mean how does
[00:05:30] it connect how does it relate to what
[00:05:32] I've already got where do I place it how
[00:05:35] important is it this is called higher
[00:05:38] order learning and it directly
[00:05:40] translates into better retention and
[00:05:43] deeper understanding just as another
[00:05:45] example here is this exact page or two
[00:05:48] pages of notes from 10 years ago that
[00:05:51] I'm redoing nonlinearly so that you can
[00:05:53] see the difference the main processes
[00:05:55] I'm using during this are to constantly
[00:05:57] look for relationships const constantly
[00:06:00] create groups based on those
[00:06:02] relationships and then constantly try to
[00:06:04] create relationships between the groups
[00:06:07] and at all times I'm thinking about how
[00:06:09] each thing relates to the big picture
[00:06:12] and how I could express all of this as
[00:06:13] simply as possible interestingly while I
[00:06:15] was doing this I found that actually my
[00:06:18] linear notes were so superficial that I
[00:06:22] had to end up just Googling things
[00:06:24] because it wasn't really allowing me to
[00:06:26] figure things out and that just goes to
[00:06:28] show how shallow my learning was even
[00:06:30] though I thought I was being incredibly
[00:06:32] detailed really I was just writing a lot
[00:06:34] of words to try to represent how it all
[00:06:38] fits together while also at the same
[00:06:40] time wasting a lot of time just writing
[00:06:42] things down without even properly
[00:06:45] fitting it all together in the end so
[00:06:46] it's kind of a lose lose situation I had
[00:06:48] to Google a lot of things to figure out
[00:06:51] how it all fits together you can see as
[00:06:53] I do this things are generally getting
[00:06:55] missier and missier and there's more
[00:06:57] relationships form me you can see I'm
[00:06:59] constant zooming in and out between
[00:07:00] different things see how it all fits
[00:07:02] together and then after that I clean it
[00:07:03] up to make it simpler the good thing
[00:07:05] about doing it this way is that we can
[00:07:07] see all the different relationships that
[00:07:09] need to be expressed and then I can go
[00:07:11] through and clean it up instead of
[00:07:12] trying to figure out everything mentally
[00:07:13] which is going to be overloading and
[00:07:15] this is the right way to use note taking
[00:07:17] it helps our brain think about the
[00:07:18] connections it helps it simplify the
[00:07:20] information down it does take some more
[00:07:22] thinking and practice but it is well
[00:07:24] worth the investment because trust me
[00:07:26] after doing this the level of confidence
[00:07:28] I felt with this page of information is
[00:07:31] way higher than when I first made this
[00:07:34] honestly I'm kind of amazed that I even
[00:07:36] managed to get an A+ with the level of
[00:07:39] detail that I had on these linear notes
[00:07:42] like it was so superficial I also felt a
[00:07:45] lot more curious about it and I can tell
[00:07:47] that the information is just stuck a lot
[00:07:49] more strongly In My Memory whereas
[00:07:50] before it used to feel like the
[00:07:51] information is slipping away almost as
[00:07:53] soon as I'd finished writing the notes
[00:07:55] but that is not all another thing that
[00:07:56] you can see is that I've massively cut
[00:07:58] down on how wordy it is research
[00:08:00] actually says that notes that have
[00:08:02] higher word counts are associated with
[00:08:04] worse performance and grades this is not
[00:08:07] because words are evil it's because
[00:08:10] having more words usually means you were
[00:08:12] thinking and processing the information
[00:08:14] less which means less learning and a lot
[00:08:16] of people say that I'll write my notes
[00:08:18] first and then I'll do all of this
[00:08:20] thinking and connecting and everything
[00:08:21] later but if all of the meaningful
[00:08:23] learning is being done later then you're
[00:08:26] probably going to run out of time and
[00:08:27] it's also just unnecessary extra work
[00:08:30] for yourself in addition one of the
[00:08:31] other really awesome things about
[00:08:33] nonlinear note taking is that you can
[00:08:36] express a lot with just the arrangement
[00:08:38] and the arrows and the spacing on a page
[00:08:41] like you know those times where you're
[00:08:42] trying to explain something to someone
[00:08:44] and you're explaining it and then you're
[00:08:45] just like ah forget it let me just show
[00:08:47] you instead it's kind of like the same
[00:08:49] thing with note taking it's usually
[00:08:51] better to show rather than explain with
[00:08:55] like an extra couple hundred words for
[00:08:57] example if you look at the screen you
[00:08:59] can see that in the beginning I had this
[00:09:02] like big loopy Arrow going like this
[00:09:05] this one here that big loopy arrow and
[00:09:07] initially I was thinking well where am I
[00:09:09] meant to put that how do I express it
[00:09:11] and so I had to make a decision to turn
[00:09:13] that Arrow into this one right here you
[00:09:16] can see that it's a lot cleaner now I
[00:09:18] had to think about where to place that
[00:09:21] and that's the same for each of these
[00:09:23] arrows I had to think where do I want to
[00:09:25] put all of these elements and where do I
[00:09:28] want to put all of these arrows to be
[00:09:29] able to express that relationship in a
[00:09:31] way that I think makes sense and is
[00:09:33] quite clean like for example I broke up
[00:09:35] this part into two this actually used to
[00:09:37] originally be up here like this a single
[00:09:40] flow but I thought that it would make
[00:09:42] more sense to split it up into two and I
[00:09:44] actually still agree with that and
[00:09:45] obviously in the linear notes it looked
[00:09:47] nothing like this it just looked like
[00:09:50] this which really doesn't Express
[00:09:53] anything and you can see that this
[00:09:54] involves a lot more thinking and
[00:09:56] processing of the information than even
[00:09:58] par paraphrasing or summarizing but that
[00:10:01] is not all of the problems because uh
[00:10:04] there's one more final issue which is
[00:10:06] that when you write linear notes on
[00:10:08] physical paper you're limited by the
[00:10:10] size of the actual paper so this is a
[00:10:13] good example where all the stuff on this
[00:10:15] page and on this page are related
[00:10:18] they're in the same topic there are
[00:10:19] really important relationships between
[00:10:21] this and with the stuff on the other
[00:10:23] Pages too but trying to express all that
[00:10:25] on paper is very limiting even when
[00:10:28] people are doing nonlinear notes on
[00:10:30] paper a lot of the time I'll see
[00:10:32] students writing these nonlinear notes
[00:10:34] but because you're using paper the scope
[00:10:37] and type of connections that they're
[00:10:39] forming are just limited by how much
[00:10:41] they could fit on that page so their
[00:10:43] learning is really dictated by how much
[00:10:45] they can fit on an A4 piece of paper
[00:10:48] rather than a authentic genuine
[00:10:50] representation of the ideas if this
[00:10:52] happens then we are essentially
[00:10:55] artificially cutting off and killing
[00:10:58] important connections relationships that
[00:11:00] could help us develop a deeper
[00:11:01] understanding that's why an iPad is so
[00:11:04] useful because you can have a app on
[00:11:06] there with Infinite Canvas and your page
[00:11:10] never ends there are no
[00:11:12] edges ever FYI I use an app called
[00:11:15] Concepts and a lot of the students on
[00:11:18] our program use Concepts as well however
[00:11:21] Apple has also recently released free
[00:11:23] form which comes bundled with every iPad
[00:11:25] and that works pretty much just as well
[00:11:28] okay let's keep the roast fest going
[00:11:30] let's have a look at some of the other
[00:11:31] notes that I have written and explain
[00:11:34] also why they are garbage so these are
[00:11:37] some of the notes in my course guide and
[00:11:39] you can see I'm doing a lot of like
[00:11:42] annotating a lot of highlighting yeah I
[00:11:44] mean like I've got like a whole other
[00:11:46] set of notes just like written on my
[00:11:48] course
[00:11:50] guide and you know I used to do this on
[00:11:52] lecture slides as well this is also
[00:11:54] pretty bad again because I'm not really
[00:11:56] doing any thinking I'm not really
[00:11:58] processing the information at all I'm
[00:12:00] just dumping it on the page if I'm in a
[00:12:04] lecture that is just going way too fast
[00:12:06] and I'm going overwhelmed and I know I'm
[00:12:08] just not able to keep up and process as
[00:12:10] I go then it's sometimes fine I know
[00:12:15] that when I wrote These this was not
[00:12:16] even during a lecture like this was in
[00:12:18] my self study there was no time pressure
[00:12:20] really like I didn't have to do this but
[00:12:23] you know the ones that I did on my
[00:12:24] lecture slides usually I was struggling
[00:12:26] to keep up during the lecture so I was
[00:12:28] just documenting it down and that can be
[00:12:31] acceptable but if afterwards the way
[00:12:33] you're consolidating that is to just
[00:12:35] turn all of those into linear notes
[00:12:37] again then we're just running into the
[00:12:39] exact same problems that I already
[00:12:40] explained ideally to avoid that
[00:12:42] situation we should have done some
[00:12:44] pre-study first and created a skeleton
[00:12:48] overall big picture frame of the topic
[00:12:50] so that when we're in the lecture we can
[00:12:51] actually fill that in with more detail
[00:12:53] and then afterwards in our self study we
[00:12:55] can add more detail and clean that up a
[00:12:57] little bit more add more detail clean it
[00:12:59] up add more clean it up so on and so
[00:13:00] forth this is why pre-study and priming
[00:13:03] is one of the most important parts of
[00:13:05] learning system because it can massively
[00:13:08] reduce the amount of overwhelm that you
[00:13:09] feel and if you want to learn more about
[00:13:11] that then check out the video here so I
[00:13:13] think based on that we can see why using
[00:13:15] an iPad can be so effective however
[00:13:18] there are some ways that people will use
[00:13:20] an iPad that makes it basically the same
[00:13:23] as just using paper and it frustrates me
[00:13:26] a lot to see this because this stuff is
[00:13:29] not cheap if you bought an iPad you
[00:13:32] should use it to its full capacity and
[00:13:35] make Steve Jobs proud or something so
[00:13:38] let me go through the examples of how
[00:13:40] people use an iPad in still the wrong
[00:13:42] ways but before we jump in I'd like to
[00:13:44] thank our sponsor me if you didn't
[00:13:47] already know everything that I've talked
[00:13:49] about in this video and actually
[00:13:50] everything I talk about in basically
[00:13:52] every other video that I've ever made is
[00:13:54] already in our guided stepbystep program
[00:13:57] at iin study.com I'm not gatekeeping the
[00:14:00] secrets to efficiency here I'm still
[00:14:02] going to be producing content for free
[00:14:04] but this program is simply just the
[00:14:06] fastest and easiest and most guided way
[00:14:09] for you to improve your skills because I
[00:14:11] don't have to make videos playing the
[00:14:13] YouTube algorithm game I can just put my
[00:14:15] educator hat on and teach you the skills
[00:14:17] the priority is to help you learn not to
[00:14:20] get views which is just the unfortunate
[00:14:22] reality of YouTube it also allows you to
[00:14:24] do the very critical thing of asking
[00:14:26] questions and then getting feedback on
[00:14:28] your work I have poured countless hours
[00:14:31] into putting everything that I know that
[00:14:33] I've learned over the last decade of
[00:14:34] becoming a hyper efficient learner
[00:14:36] myself and more importantly training
[00:14:39] other people to replicate that kind of
[00:14:41] success if you are really serious about
[00:14:43] improving your learning and you want the
[00:14:44] fastest most efficient way to do that
[00:14:47] then I'd strongly recommend checking out
[00:14:48] our program at icen study.com you'll see
[00:14:50] a link in the description we've also got
[00:14:52] tons of reviews feel free to read them
[00:14:54] if you like but anyway back to the video
[00:14:56] so a major problem of a lot of the
[00:14:58] learning apps that are available is that
[00:15:01] they are made by software developers not
[00:15:04] learning experts what they're doing is
[00:15:06] they're basically replicating the same
[00:15:09] note taking patterns and behaviors and
[00:15:11] Norms that people use with paper and
[00:15:13] then just converting that to the iPad
[00:15:15] and I have had a lot of discussions with
[00:15:18] some of these huge mega app developers
[00:15:21] and they are not willing to change their
[00:15:24] app to support learning science because
[00:15:28] it's just not a good business move it
[00:15:30] takes a lot to try to educate someone to
[00:15:33] change their norms and habits on note
[00:15:36] taking just to get them to use your app
[00:15:38] and that's just not going to be a good
[00:15:41] sales strategy so I completely
[00:15:43] understand why they are that reluctant
[00:15:45] but as a learner that just means that
[00:15:48] you have to understand that using an app
[00:15:50] that is marketed for Learning and using
[00:15:53] it as designed does not necessarily mean
[00:15:56] that you are actually going to be
[00:15:57] learning efficiently so anyway here are
[00:15:59] some examples of some iPad note taking
[00:16:01] that I think can be improved so see if
[00:16:04] you can spot what the issue is you can
[00:16:05] pause the video if you like try to
[00:16:07] figure it out yourself first one is this
[00:16:08] style of note taking we've got a picture
[00:16:11] copied in we've got some notes on the
[00:16:12] side sometimes you've got lots of
[00:16:14] annotating it looks beautiful but I do
[00:16:16] have serious doubts about how efficient
[00:16:17] it is what is the problem here pause if
[00:16:20] you want to think about it here's some
[00:16:21] other examples of basically the same
[00:16:24] thing yep the problem is exactly the
[00:16:27] same as everything I just explained
[00:16:29] before about annotating and and linear
[00:16:31] note taking there isn't a whole lot of
[00:16:33] deep processing it's really just simple
[00:16:35] paraphrasing and summarizing there's no
[00:16:37] nit works it's very isolated the copying
[00:16:40] in images looks nice the pictures but
[00:16:43] again copy paste is literally the lowest
[00:16:47] form of processing that you can do yes
[00:16:49] it's easier than trying to draw it or
[00:16:51] represent the most important parts of it
[00:16:53] for yourself but it doesn't actually
[00:16:55] make it very memorable so yes it's easy
[00:16:56] but it's also not that useful okay here
[00:16:58] has a better one uh but what is the
[00:17:00] problem here yes it's the limited page
[00:17:04] size so as a result the notes are still
[00:17:06] actually pretty linear there are some
[00:17:09] networks on this but the networks are
[00:17:10] really small and really isolated so
[00:17:13] again it's not like how real expertise
[00:17:15] should be built and structured all right
[00:17:17] final one what is the problem
[00:17:21] here this is a bit trickier it isn't
[00:17:23] very linear and the person isn't limited
[00:17:26] by Page size but the person hasn't
[00:17:28] process the information a lot because
[00:17:30] you can see that it's all sort of just
[00:17:32] coming off from the central branch which
[00:17:34] means that the only thing that they
[00:17:35] decided on was that everything is
[00:17:37] related to this one group and everything
[00:17:40] just branches out from that they haven't
[00:17:42] really thought about how to simplify it
[00:17:43] they haven't thought about how it could
[00:17:44] be subgroup they haven't thought about
[00:17:46] any other ways of grouping it you know
[00:17:48] they haven't thought about how each of
[00:17:50] the branches relate to each other for
[00:17:53] those of you that are on our program at
[00:17:54] I can study you'll notice that this is
[00:17:56] the famous wheel and spokes problem so
[00:17:59] once you can start writing notes
[00:18:01] nonlinearly and doing the right kind of
[00:18:03] thinking it just completely transforms
[00:18:06] your note taking experience one of the
[00:18:07] other major advantages is that it shows
[00:18:11] you visually where your knowledge gaps
[00:18:13] and weaknesses are what I mean is that
[00:18:15] because each step of writing the notes
[00:18:17] actually requires you to think about it
[00:18:19] and process it and make a conscious
[00:18:20] decision about how you want to express
[00:18:23] it if you struggle with that then you
[00:18:26] know that that is an area of weakness
[00:18:28] and there's a knowledge Gap normally to
[00:18:30] find these gaps with normal note taking
[00:18:32] you might have to write your notes and
[00:18:33] spend hours and hours and then weeks
[00:18:35] later when you do a practice test and
[00:18:37] you test yourself and thinking with that
[00:18:39] same pathway you realize you struggle to
[00:18:41] answer the question or you get it wrong
[00:18:43] and that's how you discover the Gap by
[00:18:45] doing this we can save literally weeks
[00:18:47] worth of time and identify the gaps
[00:18:50] immediately as you are putting them down
[00:18:53] and as a side effect we're also becoming
[00:18:54] more curious because we're finding the
[00:18:57] Gap and then we're filling the Gap and
[00:18:59] that's actually a very enjoyable
[00:19:01] engaging experience as each Gap fills
[00:19:04] our knowledge is actually becoming
[00:19:06] fundamentally stronger and more
[00:19:07] connected and so our expertise is
[00:19:09] growing and then as we learn more it
[00:19:11] gets easier and easier and simpler to
[00:19:14] understand so even though it technically
[00:19:15] takes longer to write your notes down
[00:19:19] like literally because you actually have
[00:19:20] to think about it as you write you're
[00:19:22] saving time massively overall because a
[00:19:26] you're actually having to write left l b
[00:19:29] you're actually forgetting less C you're
[00:19:32] understanding it more deeply in the
[00:19:33] first place so you don't have to do as
[00:19:35] many repetitions to try to get to that
[00:19:37] depth which is better for your
[00:19:39] confidence and anxiety D we're actually
[00:19:42] finding knowledge gaps potentially weeks
[00:19:44] earlier and E because it's helping us
[00:19:46] develop these knowledge networks it
[00:19:48] means that future content is faster and
[00:19:50] easier to learn because we have existing
[00:19:53] networks to build off and so by now you
[00:19:55] might be thinking damn learning is not
[00:19:58] as simple as I thought it was and the
[00:20:00] answer is well yeah you're right it
[00:20:04] takes time it is a legit skill but it is
[00:20:07] time that is worth investing in it pays
[00:20:10] you off lifelong what I always say is
[00:20:12] that time is going to pass anyway and
[00:20:15] months from now you're either going to
[00:20:16] have the skill or you won't and if you
[00:20:18] want to make the process of learning the
[00:20:19] skill easier then I'd recommend checking
[00:20:21] out our
[00:20:22] sponsor if you want to keep going down
[00:20:24] the rabbit hole of what efficient
[00:20:26] learning looks like then make sure to

=== Why linear note-taking is a necessary evil ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SN0Gs5M19c

[00:00:00] linear notetaking just does not work it
[00:00:02] takes a lot of time you write a lot and
[00:00:05] it's just not very good for memory and
[00:00:07] understanding and the reason is that
[00:00:08] true knowledge is not linear with linear
[00:00:12] note taking it is very very hard to
[00:00:16] represent a network and relationships
[00:00:19] however when an expert has to teach
[00:00:21] something that knowledge has to become
[00:00:24] linear because there is no other way to
[00:00:26] teach that knowledge but the important
[00:00:28] thing is that even though teaching
[00:00:30] learning has to be linear you as a
[00:00:32] learner have to reconstruct that
[00:00:35] knowledge into the nonlinear network of
[00:00:39] expertise rather than just trying to
[00:00:42] commit the imperfect linear version


=== Take control of your learning. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwAFku4UBvM

[00:00:00] when you open up a textbook a year n
[00:00:02] biology textbook or again whatever
[00:00:03] subject you're studying information
[00:00:05] makes more or less sense depending on
[00:00:08] whether we already have the foundational
[00:00:10] knowledge to process it and even in a
[00:00:12] single page in a single chapter of a
[00:00:14] textbook even within the category of
[00:00:16] year n biology there are still some
[00:00:19] pieces of information that are more
[00:00:21] advanced and then there are some pieces
[00:00:22] of information that are less Advanced
[00:00:24] but this author of The Textbook even
[00:00:26] your teacher they don't know everything
[00:00:28] that you know they don't know the
[00:00:30] intricate nature of how your brain works
[00:00:31] and even small differences can have
[00:00:33] significant effects so it's up to us as
[00:00:35] a learner to take responsibility and we
[00:00:37] take responsibility by reordering the
[00:00:39] way in which we study we are going to
[00:00:41] change the order in which we consume
[00:00:43] information and this is the one thing
[00:00:46] that I think if you started to take
[00:00:47] control of almost regardless of every
[00:00:49] other study technique that you're using
[00:00:51] you would find benefit


=== Is gaming overrated or underrated? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7K6e0LKtog

[00:00:00] gaming
[00:00:01] gaming
[00:00:03] I mean gaming is so hyped at the moment
[00:00:05] right like it's such a popular thing
[00:00:07] like I think gaming is properly rated
[00:00:11] it's fun I like gaming
[00:00:14] um you know if you're addicted that's
[00:00:15] not good but so is being addicted to
[00:00:17] anything I think it gets a bad rip
[00:00:21] um
[00:00:21] but I don't think that bad rep is
[00:00:23] necessarily deserved actually so I'm
[00:00:26] gonna say that it's super hype and it
[00:00:28] has a bad rip properly rated


=== Why are TikTok study tips harmful? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8fQo-3tXvk

[00:00:00] your teacher announces the highest and
[00:00:02] lowest grades on the last exam somehow
[00:00:04] you got the highest here's what you did
[00:00:06] so back in college I tried this weird
[00:00:08] technique called blurting I pulled out
[00:00:10] my notes the night before a huge biology
[00:00:13] exam and reviewed everything for 30
[00:00:15] minutes then I put my notes away took
[00:00:18] out a separate sheet of paper and wrote
[00:00:19] down everything that I could remember
[00:00:21] once done I used a different colored pen
[00:00:24] to write down everything I forgot
[00:00:25] repeated this process and used other
[00:00:27] tricks follow along
[00:00:30] the problem that I have is like it's
[00:00:32] really really simplified the message
[00:00:34] that studying and studying well is a
[00:00:37] simple thing to do is harmful when you
[00:00:39] hear a message saying like this is how
[00:00:41] you get the top Mark like this is what
[00:00:43] you did what that means is that if you
[00:00:45] do this technique and you still do not
[00:00:48] do well for the people that don't do
[00:00:50] well how they feel is even worse they
[00:00:53] will then start believing that they are
[00:00:56] the problem


=== How can you study ahead of the class? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEwzx3F7UJU

[00:00:00] studying ahead of class yeah definitely
[00:00:02] underrated but you don't have to like be
[00:00:05] studying everything ahead of class I
[00:00:07] think the issue is that most people
[00:00:08] don't know how to study ahead of class
[00:00:10] in a way that's effective for them that
[00:00:13] is good priming when people study ahead
[00:00:15] of class they still study at lower
[00:00:16] orders ahead of class and that is
[00:00:19] honestly like a little bit pointless
[00:00:21] like there is still a benefit but that
[00:00:24] amount of time could have been used for
[00:00:25] something that's so much more productive
[00:00:26] and people aren't used to working with
[00:00:29] purely higher order structures before
[00:00:30] filling in lower order detail but if you
[00:00:33] were able to do that then that method of
[00:00:35] Presidio priming is very helpful


=== Most students do not know their potential with learning. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGmKC2luMY

[00:00:00] was doing these deep consultations with
[00:00:01] students where I'd sit with them for an
[00:00:03] hour a couple hours and would go through
[00:00:04] every single thing that they're doing in
[00:00:06] terms of their learning process and then
[00:00:07] all the struggles that they're facing
[00:00:08] and then I would look through it and I'd
[00:00:09] say okay well here's the issue this is
[00:00:11] the reason why your entire life you've
[00:00:12] had these negative experiences like your
[00:00:14] base intelligence is actually good
[00:00:15] enough it's just being throttled because
[00:00:16] your Technique is garbage and at the
[00:00:18] time I sort of I saw it from a very
[00:00:20] mechanical tactical point of view like
[00:00:22] here are the techniques that are not
[00:00:23] working you just replace them and you're
[00:00:24] going to get better results good you've
[00:00:25] hit your outcome but they started crying
[00:00:27] and they started breaking down and
[00:00:28] initially I was very confused I was like
[00:00:29] oh did I say something wrong you
[00:00:31] know
[00:00:32] empathetic enough or whatever you know
[00:00:34] what was going on


=== Are brain dumps useful? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNDLSN8ULJo

[00:00:00] brain dots brain dumps are underrated
[00:00:03] because most people don't know them I'm
[00:00:05] pretty sure it's not a commonly known
[00:00:06] technique still fairly underutilized
[00:00:09] brain dumps are are good they're
[00:00:11] effective you need to be able to do
[00:00:12] different orders of learning for brain
[00:00:14] dumps don't just do the lower order ones
[00:00:15] low water brain dams are good for low or
[00:00:17] order retrieval practice but you you
[00:00:20] need to make sure that it's not the only
[00:00:21] method of retrieval practice like make
[00:00:22] sure to hit the higher rotors because
[00:00:23] you're going to get tested at the higher
[00:00:24] orders anyway


=== Learning Expert plays Overrated Underrated with Study Techniques ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9wsjsm0KBc

[00:00:00] hey everyone it's Dr Justin sung here
[00:00:01] I'm a former medical doctor and now
[00:00:03] full-time running coaching consultant
[00:00:04] and welcome to another episode of
[00:00:06] overrated underrated where we're going
[00:00:08] to be going through lots of different
[00:00:09] ideas and I'm going to be explaining my
[00:00:11] take on them as briefly as possible
[00:00:13] [Music]
[00:00:18] brain dumps are underrated because most
[00:00:21] people don't know them I'm pretty sure
[00:00:24] it's not a commonly known technique it's
[00:00:26] one of the more common ones I think but
[00:00:27] it's still fairly underutilized yeah
[00:00:30] brain dumps are good they're effective
[00:00:32] you need to be able to do different
[00:00:33] orders of learning for brain dumps don't
[00:00:35] just do the lower order ones like low
[00:00:37] order brain dams are good for lower
[00:00:38] order retrieval practice but you you
[00:00:41] need to make sure that it's not the only
[00:00:42] method of retrieval practice like make
[00:00:43] sure to hit the higher rotors because
[00:00:44] you're going to get tested at the higher
[00:00:46] orders anyway self-care self-care is so
[00:00:49] misunderstood and for that reason I'd
[00:00:52] say it's very underrated and and I say
[00:00:54] this as someone who like probably
[00:00:56] doesn't do enough self-care myself and
[00:00:59] I'm also internally saying I'm
[00:01:01] underrating it myself but you know you
[00:01:05] can't pull out an empty Cup right but
[00:01:07] most people is not like empty cup it's
[00:01:09] like the cup is broken and the hand is
[00:01:11] cut and then like the person is scars
[00:01:13] from ever holding a cup ever again like
[00:01:15] people will push themselves to the point
[00:01:16] not of tiredness not of exhaustion not a
[00:01:19] fatigue not at the point that they
[00:01:20] should rest but way beyond that point
[00:01:22] and they'll cycle through that point
[00:01:24] again and again and again through
[00:01:25] burnout to get to the point where now
[00:01:27] they're just like completely depleted
[00:01:29] especially in Asian countries where
[00:01:30] there's a lot of pressure to just have
[00:01:31] that like success of whatever that means
[00:01:34] so self-care is underrated really
[00:01:37] underrated
[00:01:38] hell yeah
[00:01:40] hell no in terms of the decision-making
[00:01:41] uh practice I'm presuming this is
[00:01:44] definitely underrated yeah yeah there
[00:01:46] are so many decisions that you can make
[00:01:48] that are so much simpler when you've
[00:01:49] realized that this decision doesn't
[00:01:51] require me to think too much because the
[00:01:54] consequence of failure versus the
[00:01:55] potential benefit is not significant
[00:01:58] enough for this question for this
[00:02:00] decision to be that meaningful the idea
[00:02:02] is that if it's not a hell yeah or how
[00:02:03] no decision then it doesn't really
[00:02:04] matter just make the decision and go
[00:02:06] with it it's not worth just like mulling
[00:02:08] over it too much and oh this is a really
[00:02:10] really complicated field I don't want to
[00:02:11] go into it too deep because to keep it
[00:02:12] brief but overall look it up underrated
[00:02:16] studying ahead of class yeah definitely
[00:02:19] underrated but you don't have to like be
[00:02:21] studying everything ahead of class I
[00:02:23] think the issue is that most people
[00:02:25] don't know how to study ahead of class
[00:02:27] in a way that's effective for them that
[00:02:30] is good priming when people study ahead
[00:02:31] of class they still study at lower
[00:02:33] orders ahead of class and that is
[00:02:36] honestly like a little bit pointless
[00:02:38] like there is still a benefit but that
[00:02:40] amount of time could have been used for
[00:02:41] something that's so much more productive
[00:02:43] and people aren't used to working with
[00:02:45] purely higher order structures before
[00:02:47] filling in lower order detail but if you
[00:02:49] were able to do that then that method of
[00:02:52] Presidio priming is very helpful and
[00:02:53] also all the ways that I teach about
[00:02:54] pre-studio priming any of my other
[00:02:56] videos
[00:02:57] are teaching the more effective way FYI
[00:02:59] virtual meetings
[00:03:03] people hate virtual meetings
[00:03:07] I think they're underrated because
[00:03:09] people hate them
[00:03:10] I don't love having virtual meetings but
[00:03:13] honestly like be being able to have a
[00:03:15] virtual meeting saves so much times like
[00:03:17] you know like physical meaning always
[00:03:18] takes more time and yes you're losing
[00:03:20] out on these other benefits yes I
[00:03:22] understand that and if you're only doing
[00:03:23] virtual meetings I know it's like kind
[00:03:25] of
[00:03:26] you know it kind of affects you but like
[00:03:29] it's it's still like a good thing like
[00:03:31] you know you're able to work remotely
[00:03:32] you're able to you know interact with
[00:03:34] all these other people and not have to
[00:03:35] like imagine if virtual meetings didn't
[00:03:37] exist
[00:03:38] like what would your life look like you
[00:03:39] know would you be able to even do the
[00:03:40] work that you do could you interact with
[00:03:42] the people that you interact with for
[00:03:43] that reason I'd say it's underrated even
[00:03:44] though people hate them it's like it's
[00:03:46] necessary evil
[00:03:48] New Zealand New Zealand is
[00:03:51] um
[00:03:52] hmm you know what
[00:03:56] you know what I I like living in New
[00:03:59] Zealand you know I live in New Zealand
[00:04:00] not because I have to but because I I
[00:04:02] want to I think it's a beautiful country
[00:04:05] I think in a lot of ways though I think
[00:04:07] it is overrated I think it's always that
[00:04:08] grass is greener on the other side type
[00:04:10] of thing and I say this knowing that the
[00:04:12] entire world sees New Zealand as almost
[00:04:13] like this Utopia I think anyway I think
[00:04:16] that's the impression that a lot of
[00:04:17] people have is like this like like a
[00:04:19] beautiful amazing place where like
[00:04:21] everything is really great and the
[00:04:22] healthcare is free and that's good the
[00:04:25] fact that Healthcare is free is good
[00:04:27] um like I'd much rather live in New
[00:04:29] Zealand than in the US for example where
[00:04:30] like I don't know if I get hit by a car
[00:04:32] I'll probably just die
[00:04:34] um but uh there's a lot of stuff that
[00:04:37] goes on in terms of New Zealand's like
[00:04:38] policy like Politics as well as
[00:04:42] um like the nature of the policies and
[00:04:44] sort of internalize and
[00:04:46] institutionalized racism
[00:04:48] um the climate change policies and level
[00:04:51] of proactiveness it's like this clean
[00:04:52] green image is like hmm do we really
[00:04:55] deserve that really or are we just
[00:04:57] writing off of it because the country
[00:04:58] naturally happens to be beautiful and
[00:05:00] we've got such a small population that
[00:05:01] these problems don't seem too massive
[00:05:03] yeah
[00:05:04] so a little overrated I think
[00:05:07] but still great
[00:05:09] manifestation
[00:05:11] I feel like I'm going to get hated on by
[00:05:13] like every single
[00:05:15] um I don't know like Tick Tock Instagram
[00:05:19] um like I don't even know what you call
[00:05:21] them they're just influencers for the
[00:05:22] sake of influencing
[00:05:24] um but I think it's like super overrated
[00:05:27] I really think it's very overrated I I
[00:05:30] think I don't I don't see the benefit of
[00:05:33] like all this manifestation stuff that
[00:05:35] is better than just doing like proper
[00:05:37] goal setting and planning you know like
[00:05:40] you get all the benefits you know it
[00:05:42] allows you to like focus in and
[00:05:43] centralize in and visualize where you
[00:05:45] want to go and think about it critically
[00:05:47] and then and make sure that everything
[00:05:48] is aligned to it but at least in that
[00:05:50] when you do proper goal setting and
[00:05:52] planning for it you're actually aligning
[00:05:55] your actions and behavior for it as well
[00:05:56] whereas manifestation can be Broad and
[00:05:59] some people are like literally thinking
[00:06:00] they can manifest anything by just like
[00:06:02] speaking it into the universe
[00:06:04] well let's do this you speak into the
[00:06:07] universe I'll do things we'll meet up in
[00:06:09] 10 years and see where we got okay let's
[00:06:11] just empirically test it
[00:06:16] Feynman technique I think it's
[00:06:17] pronounced but uh a fireman technique is
[00:06:21] underrated the fireman method is very
[00:06:23] good it's a great introductory way of
[00:06:25] learning about how you can actually
[00:06:27] start breaking into some levels of
[00:06:28] higher order relational thinking in a
[00:06:30] very simple easy to understand set of
[00:06:32] instructions
[00:06:33] again and this is kind of the the case
[00:06:35] with any type of self-regulated learning
[00:06:37] technique is that there's always nuances
[00:06:39] and there's always different ways that
[00:06:40] it can go like you can try to do the
[00:06:42] technique but you can interpret it wrong
[00:06:43] or you might not be able to do the
[00:06:45] processing required to get the benefit
[00:06:46] from it and then you wouldn't find it
[00:06:47] very effective and so from an individual
[00:06:50] level there's lots of other things to
[00:06:51] consider but generally if you're just
[00:06:53] shotgunning an approach if I was talking
[00:06:55] to like a a 13 year old or a 14 year old
[00:06:58] that's just getting into study
[00:07:00] strategies for the very first time
[00:07:01] finding technique would be definitely
[00:07:03] maybe top 10 on the list of things that
[00:07:05] I'll get them to start working with
[00:07:09] yeah okay well look I think most people
[00:07:11] if you're watching this video you
[00:07:13] potentially subscribe to me uh and if
[00:07:16] you subscribe to me you probably already
[00:07:18] know what my views are on Space
[00:07:19] repetition let me be super clear
[00:07:22] space repetition is overrated
[00:07:25] space repetition is necessary you can't
[00:07:27] avoid it but you shouldn't abuse it you
[00:07:30] need to know how to use it correctly and
[00:07:31] you need to know how to use it for the
[00:07:33] right types of knowledge you cannot
[00:07:35] space repetition your way you cannot
[00:07:38] wrote spaced repetition your way to
[00:07:40] success right like just think about how
[00:07:44] easy it would be to succeed if that's
[00:07:46] all you needed to do especially now with
[00:07:48] AI low order learning is becoming less
[00:07:50] and less valuable anyway data
[00:07:52] availability and just knowing things is
[00:07:54] going to be less and less important
[00:07:55] space repetition if you're not using it
[00:07:58] use it if you're not using it use it if
[00:08:02] you are using it you're probably using
[00:08:03] it enough already you don't have to do
[00:08:05] more and more so
[00:08:08] having some lower order space repetition
[00:08:10] active recall just retrieval practice
[00:08:13] coverage is good once you've covered it
[00:08:15] you're done you don't have to just keep
[00:08:17] covering it more work on the other
[00:08:19] things that are going to increase your
[00:08:20] initial encoding or your ability to have
[00:08:22] interleaved retrieval or higher orders
[00:08:24] of retrieval those are the things that
[00:08:25] are going to get you more bang for buck
[00:08:28] roof assignments uh yeah they're
[00:08:30] overrated for sure because most people
[00:08:32] in your group are not pulling their
[00:08:33] weight and and number two most people
[00:08:35] that are giving you the assignments
[00:08:36] don't really know if their time is even
[00:08:38] going to help you in the first place uh
[00:08:40] and then number three they're often very
[00:08:42] annoying logistically and just to get
[00:08:44] your head around to try to complete them
[00:08:46] there are some exceptions obviously but
[00:08:48] just as a blanket statement and I'm
[00:08:50] saying this like I've looked through
[00:08:52] lots of different curriculums and I've
[00:08:54] looked through different ways that
[00:08:55] Educators and different institutions at
[00:08:57] both secondary and tertiary education
[00:09:00] tend to think about assignments well I
[00:09:03] don't think it's very well thought out
[00:09:04] in a lot of ways so I'm going to say in
[00:09:06] general group assignments are kind of
[00:09:08] overrated they can be really tokenistic
[00:09:10] as well gaming
[00:09:13] gaming
[00:09:15] I mean gaming is so hyped at the moment
[00:09:17] right like it's such a popular thing
[00:09:19] like
[00:09:20] um I think gaming is properly rated
[00:09:24] it's fun I like gaming
[00:09:26] um you know if you're addicted that's
[00:09:28] not good but so is being addicted to
[00:09:30] anything I think it gets a bad rip
[00:09:33] um but I don't think that bad rep is
[00:09:36] necessarily deserved actually so I'm
[00:09:39] gonna say that it's super hype and it
[00:09:41] has a bad rip property rated
[00:09:44] study groups
[00:09:46] study groups are generally underrated I
[00:09:50] think people tend to avoid study groups
[00:09:51] in some situations because they haven't
[00:09:53] had good experiences with study groups
[00:09:54] before and as a result they don't feel
[00:09:57] like they
[00:09:58] will get benefit from it so they avoid
[00:10:01] it but I think if you know how to use
[00:10:03] study groups in the right way and you
[00:10:06] know how to sort of facilitate it with
[00:10:08] each other then I think study groups can
[00:10:09] be really beneficial actually
[00:10:11] so yeah underrated
[00:10:13] so that's it for this episode of
[00:10:14] overrated underrated if there's anything
[00:10:16] that I mentioned that you want me to
[00:10:17] dive into in more detail please leave a
[00:10:19] comment down below let me know what it
[00:10:21] is that you want me to dive into and
[00:10:22] also specify the question about what
[00:10:26] aspect of it you want me to dive into in
[00:10:28] the very very first overrated underrated
[00:10:29] video that we did for this I just said
[00:10:32] leave a comment below on what you want
[00:10:33] me to expand on people just said like
[00:10:34] the word expand on it and I was like
[00:10:36] what about it so that that was my fault
[00:10:38] this time be a little bit more specific
[00:10:40] but anyway thank you for watching if you
[00:10:41] like this stuff leave a like leave a
[00:10:43] comment make sure to subscribe and I'll
[00:10:44] catch you in the next one
[00:10:51] thank you

=== The Surprising Connection between Learning Skills and Self Worth ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ_ShfX-uGU

[00:00:00] beliefs you form about yourself who you
[00:00:02] are what you're capable of your
[00:00:03] potential what you can or cannot achieve
[00:00:05] and how to some extent your sense of
[00:00:06] self-worth as well a lot of that is
[00:00:08] actually attached to your perspective of
[00:00:10] how well you can learn your experiences
[00:00:11] through school how well you've done in
[00:00:13] exams how well you have performed how
[00:00:14] you're struggling compared to your
[00:00:16] friends when you're trying to learn
[00:00:16] something your ability to work with new
[00:00:18] information you've studied this thing
[00:00:19] you're trying to learn it you know all
[00:00:20] of those things feed into your sense of
[00:00:22] like sort of self-belief


=== How to make the most out of uni resources? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YBjx3iTKkY

[00:00:00] the way that I've seen most people use
[00:00:02] lecturers it's kind of like a waste of
[00:00:04] time because the questions that are
[00:00:06] being asked the lecturers are the ones
[00:00:07] that are very very basic surface level
[00:00:09] you really should be aiming to have
[00:00:11] self-regulated learning skills to the
[00:00:13] point where you don't need help with
[00:00:14] those simple level questions the way
[00:00:17] that I like to use questions is to test
[00:00:20] hypotheses or check things that I have
[00:00:22] synthesized together that is almost
[00:00:25] impossible to really figure it out for
[00:00:27] myself try to develop the skills to
[00:00:29] figure out all the basic stuff by
[00:00:31] yourself use expertise for where
[00:00:33] expertise is needed


=== The harsh truth about learning research ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpBPgGw0izU

[00:00:00] there is this existing normative belief
[00:00:02] around what learning is and how learning
[00:00:04] should be that is really sort of odd
[00:00:06] because it's actually not very logical
[00:00:07] to think about learning as occurring
[00:00:09] that way yet it is the way that everyone
[00:00:11] thinks about intuitively it's illogical
[00:00:13] yet the normative belief people have a
[00:00:15] lot of times what people don't realize
[00:00:16] is that the researchers they're not
[00:00:18] doing research to help you they do
[00:00:20] research to figure out why the brain
[00:00:23] works the way it does or what what
[00:00:25] happens and then it's just an offshoot
[00:00:27] of that kind of small subset of that
[00:00:29] which is like oh this is actually
[00:00:30] practical or what other practical
[00:00:32] implications of that and I think in
[00:00:33] recent years researchers have especially
[00:00:35] in learning Sciences area have done more
[00:00:38] of that more Outreach more like hey wait
[00:00:40] a second why are our textbooks designed
[00:00:41] like this why are teachers doing this
[00:00:43] why are students doing that but that is
[00:00:45] not the primary purpose that most
[00:00:46] research goes on you know that's not why
[00:00:49] people are writing papers that's not how
[00:00:50] people further their careers really


=== What to do if medicine doesn't align with you? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sh0fwPt2nc

[00:00:00] they know that doctors are resistant to
[00:00:02] leaving medicine and a lot of that you
[00:00:04] know for some of those people it's
[00:00:05] because they do feel like they align
[00:00:06] with medicine and we're just totally
[00:00:07] fine you know I think a lot of people
[00:00:08] misunderstand my messages like you
[00:00:10] should quit medicine but it's not right
[00:00:11] it's like meaning yeah yeah if it's not
[00:00:14] for you then you know by all means you
[00:00:16] know you have the option don't like
[00:00:17] don't kill yourself literally you know
[00:00:20] um there's there's other options and it
[00:00:21] takes a bit of work it's not as hard as
[00:00:22] hating your life for years right
[00:00:24] nothing's harder than that


=== The trick to remembering everything you study ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7obXUgx_hOM

[00:00:00] the reason why a lot of the time you'll
[00:00:02] be studying and studying and studying
[00:00:03] and then a week later you've forgotten
[00:00:05] half or more of what you've learned
[00:00:07] because when you learned it it wasn't
[00:00:09] relevant and so the trick to effective
[00:00:13] learning basically all the principles of
[00:00:15] efficient learning are about getting
[00:00:17] your brain to not prune and get rid of
[00:00:21] information that it thinks is not worth
[00:00:23] keeping and the way we do that is to in
[00:00:25] a way trick the brain into thinking that
[00:00:28] it's worth keeping and the way we do
[00:00:29] that is through creating connections and
[00:00:32] relationships


=== The TRUTH about Natural Therapies ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDPSc7Aa11E

[00:00:00] so here's something that you need to
[00:00:01] know about supplements natural therapies
[00:00:03] all of this sort of stuff way back in
[00:00:05] the day there were all these you know
[00:00:06] plants and herbs and stuff they were
[00:00:07] just ground up mixed with some pepper
[00:00:09] you know cook it over your fireplace and
[00:00:11] you drink that and you feel better we
[00:00:12] studied that right we put our science
[00:00:14] head-on we looked at that we distilled
[00:00:17] it and then we turned it into a
[00:00:19] medication so Western medication is
[00:00:22] essentially the distilled refined
[00:00:24] versions of the stuff that worked but it
[00:00:27] all started from you know like natural
[00:00:29] stuff but because science is constantly
[00:00:31] extracting the things that work from the
[00:00:33] natural stuff over time in the modern
[00:00:36] day the stuff that is considered more
[00:00:38] Natural Therapy naturopathic stuff they
[00:00:41] tend to be stuff that is more mild less
[00:00:43] consistent potentially more dangerous or
[00:00:45] in some cases legitimately it just does
[00:00:47] not work it's just completely placebo


=== Here’s the CORRECT way to do cramming ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQHo2hsQu6A

[00:00:00] cramming is effective in a lot of ways
[00:00:03] it puts our brain instead of urgency and
[00:00:05] it makes us work through the material
[00:00:06] faster and because we're covering more
[00:00:08] topics in a single session it means that
[00:00:10] we're able to find Connections in
[00:00:11] relationships between those Concepts
[00:00:13] that we might have otherwise missed if
[00:00:14] they were presented to us week by week
[00:00:16] in isolated silos
[00:00:19] however cramming is often done poorly
[00:00:22] because we do it all the way at the very
[00:00:23] end when the assignment or the exam is
[00:00:25] due if we simply just do the exact same
[00:00:27] process but we do it at the beginning it
[00:00:30] means that now we've got more free time
[00:00:32] more flexibility and we can either enjoy
[00:00:35] life and do other things


=== Zettelkasten won't work unless you do this... ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6uLcSprPic

[00:00:00] the problem that I have was little
[00:00:01] castle is actually not a problem I have
[00:00:03] with Zito casting as a system the
[00:00:04] problem that I have is that zero casting
[00:00:06] is only effective when your ability to
[00:00:08] process and prioritize the relationships
[00:00:11] is done correctly it's very dependent on
[00:00:13] your deep processing ability so if
[00:00:15] you're someone that has only used to
[00:00:16] lower order learning in low order
[00:00:17] thinking and they're creating low
[00:00:19] quality relationships and connections
[00:00:21] then the network that they create using
[00:00:23] the zerocast system method will also be
[00:00:25] low quality and so they will be very
[00:00:27] limited in the benefit that they get
[00:00:29] from it therefore I think the first step
[00:00:31] regardless of what method you're using
[00:00:33] is to get good at the cognitive skill of
[00:00:35] Higher Learning the main benefit only
[00:00:37] comes once you have a good deprocessing
[00:00:39] ability yourself first


=== How I Ranked 1st at Monash University: 4-step Framework ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z7frfjiEcM

[00:00:00] I recently graduated at the top of my
[00:00:01] class with my master of education
[00:00:03] program at Monash University which is
[00:00:05] one of the top ranked universities in
[00:00:06] the world and in this video I'm going to
[00:00:08] be sharing with you four kind of
[00:00:10] uncommon things that I did that allowed
[00:00:12] me to place first and at the end of this
[00:00:15] video I'm also going to be sharing with
[00:00:16] you one thing that I didn't do that I
[00:00:19] see a lot of people doing that would
[00:00:21] have made all four of those things
[00:00:23] basically useless so stay tuned to find
[00:00:26] out by the way if you are wondering
[00:00:28] where I am this is not a Swanky new
[00:00:31] office I wish I had a Swank in the
[00:00:33] office it looked like this but actually
[00:00:34] this is just the Airbnb that we're
[00:00:35] staying at I'm in LA right now final day
[00:00:37] of my US tour meeting up with a bunch of
[00:00:40] students it's been a good time heading
[00:00:41] to Singapore next but I'm ready to go
[00:00:43] back home okay so before we start a
[00:00:46] little bit of context the program I did
[00:00:47] was the master of education and general
[00:00:49] educational studies and going into it I
[00:00:51] set myself a goal I wanted to be able to
[00:00:54] complete the program and get very good
[00:00:56] results while spending significantly
[00:00:58] less time than normal and other people
[00:01:00] would spend on studying because
[00:01:03] you know I've got a channel I've got a
[00:01:06] reputation I guess to try to prove I
[00:01:07] wanted to show my methods in action and
[00:01:09] actually I already created videos on
[00:01:11] some of those methods which you can
[00:01:12] check out those videos do tell you how I
[00:01:15] studied for it and it's an accurate
[00:01:16] depiction of the way that I studied all
[00:01:19] my material by the end of the year I won
[00:01:20] the dean's award for academic Excellence
[00:01:22] which is given the top graduating
[00:01:23] student of the cohort my work was taken
[00:01:26] as the Exemplar for high distinction
[00:01:28] which is the highest possible grade for
[00:01:30] half of my papers I was the first
[00:01:32] student to ever receive a hundred
[00:01:34] percent in one of those papers and for
[00:01:36] one of my assignments the lecturer said
[00:01:39] that it was a waste to use it as an
[00:01:41] assignment so they actually created an
[00:01:42] entire new method of assessment that
[00:01:45] will allow me to get the grade by just
[00:01:47] getting it published somewhere instead
[00:01:49] before I graduated I was invited back to
[00:01:52] be a lecturer and I did all of this
[00:01:55] online through remote learning in fact
[00:01:57] the first time I visited the actual
[00:01:58] campus was to run a workshop for the
[00:02:01] upcoming Masters and PhD students I now
[00:02:03] now continue to guest lecture at Monash
[00:02:06] University teaching learning skills
[00:02:07] working with Masters and PhD students in
[00:02:09] education and Monash university has
[00:02:12] recently agreed to be our more research
[00:02:14] partner for I can study which is my
[00:02:16] company that teaches all of these skills
[00:02:18] to measure these methods and publish on
[00:02:22] their success and I did all of this in
[00:02:24] about 15 of the recommended time or how
[00:02:27] long other people were studying in fact
[00:02:29] if you look at just the amount of time I
[00:02:31] spent studying and taking away all the
[00:02:33] time on just literally writing essays
[00:02:35] and assignments I probably only spent
[00:02:37] about 40 hours across the entire year of
[00:02:41] proper reading and studying and without
[00:02:43] these four ways I would not have been
[00:02:46] able to do that now a disclaimer these
[00:02:49] four things they will work for basically
[00:02:51] any subject that you want to use this
[00:02:54] for basically any curriculum any
[00:02:56] structure however they do require you to
[00:02:59] have certain number of skills in place
[00:03:01] now obviously I had these skills but if
[00:03:03] you struggle struggle with these steps
[00:03:05] then you can train yourself to reach
[00:03:07] them start with a simpler version tone
[00:03:09] them down but aim to reach this
[00:03:11] eventually and I promise you you're all
[00:03:14] capable of reaching this level with a
[00:03:16] little bit of practice over time I can
[00:03:18] say that with confidence because
[00:03:18] training these skills is actually what I
[00:03:21] do for a living so let's get started
[00:03:23] with number one now the first thing is
[00:03:25] to aim high and this seems like obvious
[00:03:28] advice but you really have nothing to
[00:03:31] lose from aiming higher than you think
[00:03:33] you're capable of achieving on top of
[00:03:35] actually setting Higher Goals and
[00:03:37] pushing yourself to try a little bit
[00:03:39] harder it also makes you think
[00:03:40] fundamentally differently there used to
[00:03:42] be these really popular bracelets and I
[00:03:43] don't know if they're still popular
[00:03:44] anymore but it used to say
[00:03:46] wwjd and it stood for what would Jesus
[00:03:49] do it was really really popular because
[00:03:51] it was a way for people to think like ah
[00:03:53] what would the characteristics and
[00:03:56] attributes of in this case Jesus
[00:03:58] B in my situation and I think this is a
[00:04:02] really good reframing technique because
[00:04:03] it's very difficult for us to think
[00:04:05] about what we should do from our
[00:04:08] perspective and it can be easier to
[00:04:09] think what would someone else do that
[00:04:12] was able to achieve this so when we aim
[00:04:14] high we can think about what type of
[00:04:17] behaviors actions characteristics
[00:04:19] someone that could achieve at that level
[00:04:21] would do and then we can try to copy
[00:04:24] them and thinking about it in this way
[00:04:25] can help us study smarter rather than
[00:04:27] just harder it makes us evaluate our own
[00:04:30] bad habits and catch ourselves on things
[00:04:33] that we might doing purely because we
[00:04:35] have been used to doing them and we've
[00:04:37] been doing them for years and years even
[00:04:39] though in the back of our mind we really
[00:04:41] know it's not going to be helpful for us
[00:04:43] because we know that a truly Elite
[00:04:45] student probably isn't doing that it's
[00:04:48] going to make us look for Alternatives
[00:04:50] and you know they always say shoot for
[00:04:52] the moon and fall on the Stars if you
[00:04:55] aim high worst case scenario you just
[00:04:58] won't hit that at goal but you're
[00:05:00] probably going to do better than you
[00:05:01] would have anyway by the way I've never
[00:05:03] really understood that saying because
[00:05:04] the Moon is significantly closer than
[00:05:06] all the stars that we see in the sky
[00:05:07] septu is a simple one it is to cram yes
[00:05:11] cram but cram early I made sure at the
[00:05:14] beginning of every semester to put aside
[00:05:16] two weeks where I was going to go
[00:05:18] through all the content for all the
[00:05:20] papers as much as I could now I didn't
[00:05:22] have all the resources available I
[00:05:24] didn't have all the lecture materials
[00:05:26] they weren't released in advance I had
[00:05:28] lecture objectives to work with I knew
[00:05:31] the textbook that they were going to use
[00:05:32] and I knew the general gist of what was
[00:05:34] going to be covered so I let myself use
[00:05:36] that as a guiding Stone to get as much
[00:05:38] pre-study done as possible and cramming
[00:05:41] is effective in a lot of ways it puts
[00:05:44] our brain instead of urgency and it
[00:05:45] makes us work through the material
[00:05:46] faster and because we're covering more
[00:05:48] topics in a single session it means that
[00:05:50] we're able to find connections and
[00:05:52] relationships between those Concepts
[00:05:53] that we might have otherwise missed if
[00:05:55] they were presented to us week by week
[00:05:57] in isolated silos
[00:06:00] however cramming is often done poorly
[00:06:03] because we do it all the way at the very
[00:06:04] end when the assignment or the exam is
[00:06:06] due and that puts unnecessary stress and
[00:06:08] pressure on us if we simply just do the
[00:06:10] exact same process but we do it at the
[00:06:12] beginning it means that now we've got
[00:06:14] more free time more flexibility and we
[00:06:17] can either enjoy life and do other
[00:06:19] things for me I was still working
[00:06:21] full-time you know this has happened
[00:06:23] over the last year and a half basically
[00:06:25] so all the stuff that I've been doing
[00:06:26] that you've been seeing on my YouTube I
[00:06:28] was doing all of that concurrently while
[00:06:30] studying for my master of education so
[00:06:32] for me it was really really important to
[00:06:34] save as much time as possible I know
[00:06:37] that some of you watching you've got
[00:06:38] young family you've got kids you've got
[00:06:40] a mortgage to pay you've got a job that
[00:06:42] you're working full-time while also
[00:06:43] trying to study full-time and the trick
[00:06:46] is going to be about making sure you can
[00:06:48] clean out and save some of those days by
[00:06:51] doing your cramming as early as possible
[00:06:53] when you're working ahead doing that
[00:06:55] early cramming you have to do it the
[00:06:57] right way
[00:06:58] let me explain there's a few things that
[00:07:00] we need to think about here so this line
[00:07:02] is a timeline of learning here all right
[00:07:05] time then different types of information
[00:07:07] are more useful for our brain depending
[00:07:11] on what stage of learning we're at so in
[00:07:14] the earlier stages our brain is craving
[00:07:16] more structure it doesn't do well with
[00:07:19] lots of fine details it doesn't do well
[00:07:22] with all those facts and figures and
[00:07:23] statistics and definitions what it wants
[00:07:25] to know is how to think about the topic
[00:07:28] compared to the later stages where then
[00:07:31] it's going to be a lot better to take in
[00:07:33] all of those details because those
[00:07:35] details now become more relevant and
[00:07:38] this is just all about Connections and
[00:07:40] this is what research on human cognitive
[00:07:42] architecture tells us at the beginning
[00:07:43] our brain has a prior set of knowledge
[00:07:47] and connections and networks which allow
[00:07:49] it to make sense of information now if a
[00:07:52] new piece of information comes in and we
[00:07:54] cannot see how they might be connected
[00:07:56] to what we already know then it becomes
[00:07:59] very difficult to make it relevant which
[00:08:02] means that our brain doesn't see what
[00:08:03] the point is of holding on to it which
[00:08:06] is why we would very quickly forget it
[00:08:09] and this is the reason why a lot of the
[00:08:11] time you'll be studying and studying and
[00:08:13] studying and then a week later you've
[00:08:14] forgotten half or more of what you've
[00:08:16] learned because when you learned it it
[00:08:19] wasn't relevant and so the trick to
[00:08:22] effective learning basically all the
[00:08:24] principles of efficient learning are are
[00:08:26] about getting your brain to not prune
[00:08:29] and get rid of information that it
[00:08:32] thinks is not worth keeping and the way
[00:08:34] we do that is to in a way trick the
[00:08:36] brain into thinking that it's worth
[00:08:38] keeping and the way we do that is
[00:08:40] through creating connections and
[00:08:42] relationships so at the very very
[00:08:44] beginning when you're first learning
[00:08:45] about a subject what we want to do is we
[00:08:47] want to find those key pieces of
[00:08:49] information throughout the entire text
[00:08:51] of what we're learning that we know are
[00:08:53] slightly more relevant and familiar
[00:08:56] compared to the knowledge that we all
[00:08:58] already have and this allows us to
[00:09:01] create what I often call Anchor points
[00:09:03] of relevance that means that when we get
[00:09:05] new information coming in after that we
[00:09:08] now know how it's connected because
[00:09:09] we've got more points to connect it with
[00:09:11] and then as we continue to learn more we
[00:09:14] can connect it to more and more points
[00:09:16] so in a way what we're saying is that
[00:09:18] the easiest way to learn something new
[00:09:20] is to have prior knowledge on it already
[00:09:22] you can't always apply knowledge and
[00:09:24] everything so what we do is that we
[00:09:25] build prior knowledge which I know
[00:09:28] sounds impossible and I guess
[00:09:30] technically if you really get into
[00:09:32] definitions it is impossible but
[00:09:34] hopefully you get the gist it's about
[00:09:35] taking the level you're at now and then
[00:09:37] learning just enough to take you to the
[00:09:39] next level which allows the next level
[00:09:41] to be more relevant and the next level
[00:09:42] to be more relevant so that eventually
[00:09:44] you can cover all of the content down to
[00:09:46] the finest detail but each step feels
[00:09:49] relevant because you're building on the
[00:09:51] knowledge of the previous step and it
[00:09:52] often means that you have to go out of
[00:09:54] order skipping huge amounts of material
[00:09:56] as you go on your first passes through
[00:09:58] the material real there is a time to
[00:10:01] learn everything and knowing when is the
[00:10:03] right time is something that makes a
[00:10:06] enormous difference if you spend all of
[00:10:08] your time at the early stages committing
[00:10:09] to details and definitions and trying to
[00:10:11] memorize everything then there's no
[00:10:12] point because a few weeks later you're
[00:10:14] gonna have forgotten it anyway you're
[00:10:16] still not going to know how to think
[00:10:17] about it you're still not going to know
[00:10:18] how it's all related together because
[00:10:20] you haven't been able to consolidate it
[00:10:22] a lot of people say that you should go
[00:10:23] and memorize things first and then
[00:10:25] consolidate it afterwards but that
[00:10:27] doesn't actually make sense you cannot
[00:10:29] learn it first and consolidate it
[00:10:30] afterwards at least not efficiently
[00:10:31] Because by the time you come to
[00:10:33] consolidating it you've already
[00:10:35] forgotten a lot of it that's how good
[00:10:37] and efficient your brain is at for
[00:10:39] getting information that's why the most
[00:10:41] efficient way is to make sure that we're
[00:10:43] consolidating it at the time we are
[00:10:45] learning it in fact some fascinating
[00:10:47] Neuroscience research has shown that the
[00:10:49] quality of your memory later in the
[00:10:51] future can be predicted at least
[00:10:54] partially by the type of activity your
[00:10:56] brain underwent at the first time at
[00:10:58] learned it which means is that how we
[00:10:59] think about information now when we
[00:11:01] first consume it dictates how well we're
[00:11:04] going to know that information later
[00:11:06] which is also kind of logical if you
[00:11:09] think about it so ignore those details
[00:11:10] at the beginning when I was going
[00:11:12] through and if you watch my other videos
[00:11:14] when I'm actually studying it you'll see
[00:11:15] that I'm putting this in practice I'm
[00:11:16] getting a big picture understanding and
[00:11:18] then each iteration I'm just building
[00:11:20] the complexity and depth and detail of
[00:11:23] that information if I run out of time
[00:11:24] that's fine because I've gotten the most
[00:11:26] important stuff done first if I really
[00:11:29] need to cram in those details I can do
[00:11:31] that a week or two before the exam just
[00:11:33] Chuck it into that short-term memory
[00:11:34] cram the details in and even if I forget
[00:11:36] it a couple weeks later it's all good
[00:11:38] because I wouldn't even need it a couple
[00:11:39] weeks later so it's about being
[00:11:41] strategic with what information you
[00:11:43] learn at what stage of your learning
[00:11:46] process and this is crucial for
[00:11:48] Effective learning if you don't follow
[00:11:50] these principles I don't think it's
[00:11:52] realistic to do well at least at a
[00:11:55] higher level especially you know for
[00:11:57] those of you that are in University or
[00:11:58] those of you that are in high school
[00:11:59] that are struggling with this this is
[00:12:01] going to flip your world upside down so
[00:12:04] how do we actually do this well you can
[00:12:06] look at my other video to see some of
[00:12:07] the techniques that I use in terms of
[00:12:09] non-linear mapping and how I arrange
[00:12:10] those Concepts it's quite a bit to go
[00:12:12] through that video is going to do it
[00:12:13] more Justice than I can right now
[00:12:15] literally because I have to check out of
[00:12:16] this Airbnb in like 20 minutes I need to
[00:12:19] wrap this video up and by the way here's
[00:12:21] a very interesting thing is that we
[00:12:22] actually intuitively already know that
[00:12:24] there is a time and place to learn
[00:12:26] different types of information so for
[00:12:28] example if you were learning biology for
[00:12:30] the very very first time in your life
[00:12:32] you wouldn't say that the most efficient
[00:12:33] way to learn that is to go and read
[00:12:35] through 2000 PhD thesis to try to figure
[00:12:40] out you know basic Elementary biology
[00:12:44] it'd just be way Overkill and just go
[00:12:46] over your head you know for example if
[00:12:48] you want to learn about learning science
[00:12:49] the most efficient way to learn about
[00:12:51] learning science is not to spend years
[00:12:54] of your life going through primary
[00:12:56] research on learning science to create
[00:12:58] data system the most efficient way to
[00:13:00] learn it would actually be to join let's
[00:13:03] say a program created by someone that
[00:13:05] did spend all that time to do that and
[00:13:07] did all the trial and error for you and
[00:13:08] then packaged it in a very very nice
[00:13:10] consumable way for someone like yourself
[00:13:15] so we know that some information is
[00:13:17] going to go over our heads if it's too
[00:13:18] advanced but the trick is realizing that
[00:13:21] that happens at a micro level to even in
[00:13:23] a single lecture even in a single
[00:13:25] chapter even in a single paragraph some
[00:13:28] information is simply not suited for our
[00:13:30] brain at that time and it's better to
[00:13:33] pick the path of most relevant you will
[00:13:37] be able to cover all the information
[00:13:39] you're not going to miss anything it
[00:13:40] just means that you're going to go
[00:13:41] through it multiple times picking up
[00:13:43] different things as you go and now the
[00:13:46] fourth point and this is actually more
[00:13:47] of a pro tip but it is to be very
[00:13:48] resourceful and strategic with the way
[00:13:51] that you use your resources and the
[00:13:53] biggest resource that you have often in
[00:13:54] University setting is the staff the
[00:13:57] lecturers now the way that I've seen
[00:13:58] most people use lecturers is it's kind
[00:14:01] of like a waste of time because the
[00:14:03] questions that are being asked the
[00:14:04] lecturers are the ones that are very
[00:14:06] very basic surface level they're just
[00:14:08] saying I don't understand this can you
[00:14:09] explain it to me you know what is the
[00:14:11] meaning of this particular thing you
[00:14:12] said this in the lecture what does that
[00:14:13] mean you really should be aiming have
[00:14:15] self-regulated learning skills to the
[00:14:17] point where you don't need help with
[00:14:19] those simple level questions these are
[00:14:21] the types of problems that you need to
[00:14:22] have the skill to be able to figure out
[00:14:24] yourself like you shouldn't really have
[00:14:25] to ask someone else for low level
[00:14:28] information like that you can either
[00:14:29] look it up yourself and learn the skills
[00:14:32] of looking things up or learn the
[00:14:35] process of self-explanation and
[00:14:37] generation now this is obviously for a
[00:14:40] more mature set of Learners like if you
[00:14:42] are listening to this right now and
[00:14:44] you're like 11 12 years old yeah asking
[00:14:47] your teachers about things is going to
[00:14:48] be really important part of your
[00:14:49] learning strategy but even then we
[00:14:52] should be aiming to get to a point where
[00:14:54] we don't really need to be asking for
[00:14:56] very simple information it's a war skill
[00:15:00] that's going to transfer through for the
[00:15:02] rest of your life the way that I like to
[00:15:03] use questions is to test hypotheses or
[00:15:07] check things that I have synthesized
[00:15:09] together that is almost impossible to
[00:15:12] really figure it out for myself so for
[00:15:14] example people for one of my papers we
[00:15:16] were introduced to like 13 different
[00:15:18] models for adopting new Innovations and
[00:15:22] new Innovative educational Frameworks
[00:15:24] and Technologies and all 13 Frameworks
[00:15:26] we were meant to kind of learn them and
[00:15:28] see some of the trends and the
[00:15:29] similarities and as I was going through
[00:15:31] them I wanted to synthesize a
[00:15:33] comprehensive framework that looked at
[00:15:34] all the different angles that the other
[00:15:36] Frameworks did so I went through and
[00:15:38] found the trends and similarities and
[00:15:40] compared and contrasted and I spent
[00:15:42] about you know pretty solid hour and a
[00:15:44] half just going through back and forth
[00:15:46] with these models to create my version
[00:15:48] of a model that I thought abided by all
[00:15:51] the considerations of the other models
[00:15:53] padded up for the weaknesses of some of
[00:15:55] the models and enhance some of the
[00:15:56] strengths of the other models and at the
[00:15:58] end of that I had this singular kind of
[00:16:00] Fairly comprehensive multi-faceted model
[00:16:02] that made sense for me it's really
[00:16:04] important that it's for me because I'm
[00:16:06] the one that put in the cognitive effort
[00:16:08] to make it make sense and therefore
[00:16:09] that's why it's going to be beneficial
[00:16:11] for learning if someone else were to
[00:16:13] just simply look at it they're not going
[00:16:14] to get you know that Enlightenment that
[00:16:16] I did because they didn't put in the
[00:16:18] work to try and understand it they're
[00:16:20] not receiving the learning because they
[00:16:21] didn't do the thinking either the
[00:16:23] thinking therefore I'm getting the
[00:16:24] learning out of it now for me to check
[00:16:26] if that model is accurate would probably
[00:16:29] take I mean that's probably honestly
[00:16:31] like a whole phd's worth of work to do
[00:16:34] that like that information is probably
[00:16:36] does not even exist anywhere because I
[00:16:37] synthesized it it's sort of new and
[00:16:39] that's what I use the lecture time for I
[00:16:41] got a meeting with the lecturer and I
[00:16:43] said hey I've been looking through all
[00:16:44] this stuff I created a model that I
[00:16:45] think for me makes a lot of sense can I
[00:16:47] run you through it and can you let me
[00:16:48] know if I'm missing something if there
[00:16:50] are any red flags if I completely
[00:16:51] misunderstood some perspectives of it I
[00:16:53] ran through the thing and they said it
[00:16:54] looks really good and in fact they
[00:16:56] invited me back to present it to the
[00:16:57] rest of the class to show as an example
[00:16:59] for other people what they should be
[00:17:00] doing when they're going through the
[00:17:02] readings so that's an example where
[00:17:04] someone with years and years of
[00:17:06] experience can look at it and say yup
[00:17:08] that makes sense in a 15-20 minute
[00:17:10] conversation whereas it would have taken
[00:17:12] me 15 to 20 months of my own and work to
[00:17:15] try to verify it now that's a strategic
[00:17:17] use of lecturer expertise time and this
[00:17:21] is the same case for when you're working
[00:17:22] with supervisors or mentors in the
[00:17:24] workplace as well try to develop the
[00:17:25] skills to figure out all the basic stuff
[00:17:27] by yourself use expertise for where
[00:17:30] expertise is needed and at least of all
[00:17:33] it's going to give your markers and
[00:17:37] supervisors a favorable impression
[00:17:39] because those types of questions are the
[00:17:41] ones that show them that you are really
[00:17:43] a high level thinker which brings us to
[00:17:46] the final point which is the one thing I
[00:17:49] didn't do that I see a lot of students
[00:17:52] doing all of the time where if I had
[00:17:55] done that all four of the things that
[00:17:57] I've just told you about would have been
[00:17:59] made redundant it wouldn't have had any
[00:18:01] real impact and that is that I did not
[00:18:04] compromise on the non-negotiables what
[00:18:08] does that mean that sounds really
[00:18:09] confusing and actually the statement is
[00:18:11] confusing let me explain at the
[00:18:12] beginning of the paper I was out of a
[00:18:15] WhatsApp group with all the other
[00:18:16] students and I very quickly realized
[00:18:18] that some of the students were really
[00:18:19] struggling with the workload they were
[00:18:21] studying a lot of hours and they were
[00:18:22] not really getting a lot of reward out
[00:18:24] of it they were struggling to understand
[00:18:25] the concepts the assignments were really
[00:18:27] stressing them out their point I
[00:18:28] essentially already finished the entire
[00:18:29] semester's worth of material and the
[00:18:32] students asked me for advice on what
[00:18:34] they should do and I told them some of
[00:18:36] the things that I've just told you right
[00:18:37] now for example you know make sure to
[00:18:39] cram early try to study ahead finish
[00:18:41] through the semester and one of the
[00:18:42] things that was very common for them to
[00:18:46] fire back with was but we don't know
[00:18:48] what's going to be covered the lectures
[00:18:50] haven't been released yet we don't have
[00:18:52] enough all we have to work with is this
[00:18:54] textbook we don't know what parts are
[00:18:55] going to be relevant all we have is that
[00:18:57] we know what the assignments are going
[00:18:59] to be about and we have a very general
[00:19:01] lecture outline but we don't know what
[00:19:03] the material is there's no slides for it
[00:19:05] yet I can't do it I can't study that way
[00:19:07] Justin but the thing is I did and that's
[00:19:10] the difference is I know that in order
[00:19:13] for me to make things work and order for
[00:19:15] me to work full-time or Beyond full-time
[00:19:17] hours while studying for my master of
[00:19:19] education which is a full-time program
[00:19:21] and to do well and to do it and only 15
[00:19:24] of the time I need to achieve my goal I
[00:19:26] needed to do that I needed to cram
[00:19:29] everything in early so for me I wanted
[00:19:31] to find the solution so I used what I
[00:19:34] could I made do what the resources I had
[00:19:36] available I used Google and Wikipedia
[00:19:39] and the textbooks and the recommended
[00:19:40] readings and whatever it is and I tried
[00:19:43] to figure it out I made an educated
[00:19:45] guess on what I think is likely to be
[00:19:47] covered even though the lecture slides
[00:19:49] aren't there I said well look I'm
[00:19:51] probably going to get at least 70
[00:19:52] percent close and the 30 I'm missing I
[00:19:56] can pick that up during the lectures but
[00:19:57] at least I've got that Head Start it's
[00:19:59] better than nothing and so I had that
[00:20:01] kind of solutions mentality I wasn't
[00:20:03] looking for reasons why I couldn't
[00:20:06] follow these rules I was looking for the
[00:20:09] path that allowed me to follow the rules
[00:20:10] because I knew that they were
[00:20:12] non-negotiables I had to do that if I
[00:20:15] was going to succeed at this task and
[00:20:18] very very very often when I'm working
[00:20:22] with students and they come to me with
[00:20:23] their concerns about things and I asked
[00:20:25] them about what they're doing with their
[00:20:27] methods and the techniques and a lot of
[00:20:28] time I've already taught them techniques
[00:20:29] and I've already taught them the methods
[00:20:31] but they say I can't do it because of
[00:20:33] this reason my commute is too long I'm
[00:20:36] spending too much you know I'm not able
[00:20:37] to focus at home I fall asleep in the
[00:20:40] library I'm you know procrastinate too
[00:20:42] much but whatever other excuse there is
[00:20:44] they're looking for a reason why they
[00:20:47] cannot do it and so I ask the question
[00:20:49] are you really wanting help why are you
[00:20:52] just wanting validation for why it's
[00:20:55] hard for you
[00:21:01] and the light just turned off I need to
[00:21:03] check out my Airbnb in like five minutes
[00:21:06] I haven't packed yet
[00:21:08] that's pretty good segue I'll leave you
[00:21:10] with that thought I'll catch you next
[00:21:11] time

=== What would someone smarter than you do? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewzgaWBF_E

[00:00:00] there used to be these really popular
[00:00:01] bracelets they used to say
[00:00:03] wwjd and it stood for what would Jesus
[00:00:06] do it was a way for people to think like
[00:00:08] oh what would the characteristics and
[00:00:11] attributes of in this case Jesus
[00:00:13] B in my situation and I think this is a
[00:00:16] really good reframing technique because
[00:00:18] it's very difficult for us to think
[00:00:20] about what we should do from our
[00:00:23] perspective and it can be easier to
[00:00:24] think what would someone else do that
[00:00:27] was able to achieve this we can think
[00:00:29] about what type of behaviors actions
[00:00:32] characteristics someone that could
[00:00:34] achieve at that level would do and then
[00:00:36] we can try to copy them and thinking
[00:00:38] about it in this way can help us study
[00:00:40] smarter rather than just harder


=== How to know if you're sleep deprived? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZiVlHNPmEA

[00:00:00] if you are chronically sleep deprived
[00:00:01] it's possible that you actually do not
[00:00:04] know what it's like to be well rested I
[00:00:06] legitimately didn't realize what being
[00:00:09] well rested felt like until I quit
[00:00:11] medicine and did like educational
[00:00:13] entrepreneurship full-time the feeling
[00:00:14] of just wanting to never wake up and the
[00:00:17] feeling like you need to take a nap
[00:00:18] every single day that's not actually
[00:00:20] normal it's not really healthy you're
[00:00:22] probably at some level sleep deprived
[00:00:24] the danger of chronic sleep deprivation
[00:00:26] is that you don't really know the impact
[00:00:28] that it's having on you until you
[00:00:30] compare it directly with being well
[00:00:31] rested I didn't know how inefficient I
[00:00:33] was being until I was well rested so
[00:00:35] have you fixed that sleep hygiene do
[00:00:37] everything you can to optimize your
[00:00:39] sleep hygiene for like three weeks and
[00:00:41] you'll see results


=== The Right Way to do a Dopamine Detox ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTSW93wYq7I

[00:00:00] dopamine detox is not about removing
[00:00:02] dopamine from your system it's not about
[00:00:04] doing things you hate it's about
[00:00:06] connecting with that slower more natural
[00:00:08] pace of dopamine release that you'd find
[00:00:10] in a
[00:00:12] non-artificially dopamine-heading world
[00:00:15] that we live in today there's a lot of
[00:00:16] different ways that you can do it just
[00:00:17] turning off your phone so that you're
[00:00:19] not going to be inclined to pick it up
[00:00:21] again putting it somewhere like sliding
[00:00:23] it under your bed or really just
[00:00:25] removing it out of sight and then
[00:00:26] putting yourself physically in an
[00:00:28] environment that is free from all of
[00:00:30] those dopamine hit type of things and
[00:00:32] then connect with something away from
[00:00:35] those artificial dopamine hits that you
[00:00:37] enjoy


=== What is intelligence? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_1gtD3IPwk

[00:00:00] what even is intelligence I am good at
[00:00:03] learning it's my thing this is what I do
[00:00:05] it's my job like I dedicate my life to
[00:00:06] it right so this is not a humble brag
[00:00:08] like I've dedicated my life to it I'm
[00:00:10] allowed to be good at this one thing
[00:00:12] however it doesn't mean that I am an
[00:00:14] expert at literally everything most of
[00:00:16] the time when I'm in a room I'm not the
[00:00:18] best at anything other than just
[00:00:19] teaching learning skills so intelligence
[00:00:22] is really kind of this false label I
[00:00:24] mean like what does it really mean
[00:00:25] because people are not looking for
[00:00:27] intelligence what people want are the
[00:00:30] outcome they want the result


=== Study music is Overrated: Learning Expert Explains WHY ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VAwuzuyu3A

[00:00:00] hey everyone it's Dr Justin sung here
[00:00:01] I'm a former medical doctor and now
[00:00:03] full-time learning coach and consultant
[00:00:05] and this is another episode of overrated
[00:00:07] underrated where we're going to be
[00:00:08] taking a lot of different ideas and I'm
[00:00:09] going to be giving my take on them as
[00:00:11] briefly as possible so let's go
[00:00:17] okay reading nonfiction overrated or
[00:00:20] underrated reading nonfiction overall
[00:00:22] I'm gonna say is properly rated because
[00:00:26] it's useful but also it's not useful if
[00:00:30] you just like buy a non-fiction book you
[00:00:31] read it and then you assume that that
[00:00:33] knowledge is now yours you can use it
[00:00:34] you have integrated you've applied the
[00:00:35] skill like learning and then consuming
[00:00:37] knowledge actually not the same thing
[00:00:40] some people just buy books and consume
[00:00:42] it and then they're like oh yeah that's
[00:00:43] part of my life now but actually you
[00:00:45] look at the bookshelf it's like well how
[00:00:46] much of that are you actually applying
[00:00:47] in your life so in that case it could be
[00:00:49] overrated but a lot of people do not
[00:00:51] read very much so therefore that will be
[00:00:52] underrated so therefore we land in the
[00:00:54] middle at properly rated
[00:00:56] listen to music while studying I think
[00:00:58] is overrated for sure so the whole idea
[00:01:00] behind listening to music especially
[00:01:01] classical music is actually done through
[00:01:04] correlative studies like there used to
[00:01:05] be these studies that were done on like
[00:01:06] high achieving students and what they
[00:01:07] listen to and then they listen to more
[00:01:09] classical music I think specifically
[00:01:10] there's the more Beethoven or Mozart or
[00:01:12] something but that there's so much
[00:01:14] confounding in those studies that those
[00:01:15] Studies have now since essentially been
[00:01:16] discredited when you look at this purely
[00:01:18] the research around like list like the
[00:01:20] sensation of taking in something orally
[00:01:22] while you're listening there doesn't
[00:01:24] seem to be any benefit of actually
[00:01:25] listening to anything or rhythmic or
[00:01:27] even like binaural beats and things
[00:01:30] there's not really strong evidence for
[00:01:31] it for me personally and for what I
[00:01:33] recommend to my students I generally
[00:01:35] just recommend having White Noise if
[00:01:37] there's anything that requires deep
[00:01:38] cognitive Focus
[00:01:39] I haven't been convinced that listening
[00:01:41] to music is beneficial for that for
[00:01:44] doing things that don't require so much
[00:01:45] cognitive Focus then yes uh definitely
[00:01:47] something that's a little bit more
[00:01:48] creative something a little bit more
[00:01:49] relaxed something where you're just kind
[00:01:50] of like going along in your workflow
[00:01:52] that's fine I listen to Lo-Fi like crazy
[00:01:54] my Spotify my Spotify wrap up for the
[00:01:56] years always a slow by Lo-Fi Lo-Fi Lo-Fi
[00:01:58] okay so I listen to a lot but I don't
[00:02:01] when I need a really focus and
[00:02:02] concentrate
[00:02:05] chat chatgpt is extremely like The Buzz
[00:02:10] and it's still it's probably still
[00:02:12] slightly underrated
[00:02:14] um most people don't realize but right
[00:02:16] now I'm sort of months into working on a
[00:02:18] artificial intelligence email project
[00:02:20] um with some with some big names and
[00:02:22] I've been in this space and I've been
[00:02:24] learning about it and then
[00:02:24] coincidentally chat GPT got released
[00:02:27] like in the middle of me working through
[00:02:28] that so when I was looking through it I
[00:02:30] was looking through a lens of just an
[00:02:31] educator but also someone that had been
[00:02:33] kind of immersed in the AI email space
[00:02:35] for a little bit by that point and I
[00:02:38] think the way that chat GPT will be
[00:02:40] utilized and can be utilized are still
[00:02:42] being very very like you know most
[00:02:45] people are not using it to the extent
[00:02:47] that it could be used they're not
[00:02:48] getting the efficiency they could get
[00:02:49] most people probably don't have the base
[00:02:52] learning technique at a higher order to
[00:02:54] be able to use chappy T in the right way
[00:02:56] because there are certain inquiry
[00:02:58] approaches that could be really
[00:02:59] effective if used in the right way
[00:03:01] however most people don't have a system
[00:03:02] that would allow them to use that in the
[00:03:04] first place because it's too lower order
[00:03:06] based so for that reason it's going to
[00:03:07] be underrated
[00:03:09] Coach House
[00:03:11] [Music]
[00:03:13] I want to say Coach House overrated
[00:03:15] um and look this is going to be
[00:03:16] completely just purely anecdotal like
[00:03:18] this is not coming from me having like
[00:03:20] years of experience working with
[00:03:21] students and things like this is just
[00:03:23] like me thinking about it myself I
[00:03:25] believe I am able to have good focus and
[00:03:28] productivity and you know manage myself
[00:03:31] and things like that I do not need to
[00:03:33] take cold showers and just purely
[00:03:35] anecdotally
[00:03:37] some of the people around me that are
[00:03:38] into taking cold showers are not
[00:03:40] particularly very productive or focused
[00:03:42] so it makes me think maybe it's like the
[00:03:45] easy thing that you can set your mind to
[00:03:47] to do that kind of like you know can
[00:03:49] help trigger and springboard things for
[00:03:51] you but I feel like there are probably
[00:03:54] more high-yield things that you could
[00:03:55] work on that are maybe less obvious to
[00:03:59] understand as shower in cold water
[00:04:02] um so for that reason I'm gonna say it's
[00:04:04] a little overrated I think I think it's
[00:04:07] hyped a little bit more than it maybe
[00:04:09] needs to be
[00:04:11] Khan Academy
[00:04:14] Khan Academy is probably
[00:04:17] underrated Khan Academy does a lot in
[00:04:19] the equity for Education space so I
[00:04:21] think most people don't know this but
[00:04:23] um for you know I've been in the
[00:04:25] education industry for 10 years now and
[00:04:28] my first seven years were in the
[00:04:29] non-profit sector in fact I didn't even
[00:04:31] pay myself for the first four or five
[00:04:32] years four and a half years so I am very
[00:04:36] very like keenly aware of the issues of
[00:04:38] like equity in in education and Khan
[00:04:40] Academy was one of the first players on
[00:04:42] the scene that actually did that at a
[00:04:43] global scale like Khan Academy is like
[00:04:45] an OG in the in the edtech and education
[00:04:47] online learning space no one was doing
[00:04:49] it like Khan before Khan Academy well at
[00:04:52] least no one was doing it well so I
[00:04:54] think for the impact the Khan Academy
[00:04:55] made the road that it paved the equity
[00:04:58] for Education that it's done and a lot
[00:04:59] of the non-profit work that Khan Academy
[00:05:00] continues to do I'm going to say it's
[00:05:02] it's underrated I don't think it gets a
[00:05:03] prop set it deserves
[00:05:05] foreign
[00:05:07] extremely overrated unless you are doing
[00:05:10] a career that literally requires that
[00:05:13] degree so for example like medicine law
[00:05:15] accounting like uh you know Financial
[00:05:18] Services type thing like these these
[00:05:20] career Pathways that the entry point to
[00:05:22] it is having the degree outside of those
[00:05:24] I would say that University is I think
[00:05:26] it's very very overrated I know that
[00:05:28] there are some degrees that the
[00:05:29] workplace is changing faster than the
[00:05:31] curriculum is changing so it's like I
[00:05:33] mean the Gap is going to be widening and
[00:05:35] widening and widening so I remember you
[00:05:37] know one of the previous marketing
[00:05:38] interns that I hired on they eventually
[00:05:40] became my marketing manager they they
[00:05:42] did a marketing degree and they said
[00:05:43] that none of the stuff they learned in
[00:05:45] uni they were able to actually use at
[00:05:48] their work and everything they learned
[00:05:49] about marketing was just purely on the
[00:05:50] job and I looked at the curriculum and I
[00:05:53] could agree the stuff was so outdated so
[00:05:56] for example it was a marketing degree at
[00:05:57] the time this is like six seven years
[00:05:58] ago now at the time there was nothing
[00:06:00] about social media can you imagine doing
[00:06:02] a marketing degree with nothing about
[00:06:03] social media anyway overall I think
[00:06:06] universities are never going to be able
[00:06:07] to catch out fast enough and so for some
[00:06:09] some Industries I don't think it's
[00:06:12] necessary and I think a lot of employers
[00:06:14] are wising up to that to the point where
[00:06:16] you do not need to have the degree to
[00:06:18] have certain jobs when five ten years
[00:06:21] ago you used to so if you're looking at
[00:06:23] going into University because you want
[00:06:24] to go down a career pathway I'd
[00:06:25] recommend go and look at what the
[00:06:28] employment space is like see right now
[00:06:30] today do you actually need that degree
[00:06:32] or can you do a udemy course can you do
[00:06:35] a course there like can you do something
[00:06:36] else without without having the
[00:06:37] university part
[00:06:38] [Music]
[00:06:40] oh School teachers well School teachers
[00:06:43] are you know like an entire group like a
[00:06:46] massive group of people as they're not
[00:06:48] homogeneous I think I think that they're
[00:06:50] they are underrated because of the fact
[00:06:53] that most people will never really
[00:06:54] interface with education very deeply and
[00:06:56] so they don't really know what it's like
[00:06:57] behind the scenes and so they you know
[00:06:59] they they don't really understand the
[00:07:01] plight of a school teacher already and
[00:07:02] and what they have to kind of deal with
[00:07:03] you know but having said that if you've
[00:07:05] had a bad teacher is that bad teacher
[00:07:08] like underrated well I mean like no not
[00:07:10] not really I suppose but I think the
[00:07:12] issue is that it's very easy to become a
[00:07:14] bad teacher because the system is set up
[00:07:16] where being a good teacher is actually
[00:07:17] very hard it takes a lot of energy and a
[00:07:20] lot of effort so that's why they are
[00:07:22] they're rare
[00:07:24] um and so School teachers as a general
[00:07:26] category I'll say that it's they're
[00:07:28] underrated
[00:07:31] inquiry-based learning is
[00:07:35] in the present sense the way that is
[00:07:37] being used now and the way that it's
[00:07:39] being implemented in the real world by
[00:07:41] the vast majority of Institutions
[00:07:43] inquiry-based learning is heavily
[00:07:45] overrated because inquiry-based learning
[00:07:48] is first of all does not have great
[00:07:50] evidence for it when you when you look
[00:07:51] at the implementation there are a lot of
[00:07:52] variables that factor into it
[00:07:56] inquiry-based learning is actually one
[00:07:57] school of thought that this was in
[00:07:59] construct constructivist schools of
[00:08:01] education and learning whereas the
[00:08:04] opposite is called cognitivist and I
[00:08:06] think the best blend is the marriage of
[00:08:08] the two like inquiry-based learning
[00:08:10] misses a lot of the things that are very
[00:08:12] valuable in the cognitive of space and
[00:08:13] therefore you have these schools and
[00:08:15] people that are using inquiry-based
[00:08:17] learning and they're not getting any
[00:08:18] effect from it and then they're
[00:08:19] wondering why and it's because the
[00:08:21] missing ingredient might be something in
[00:08:22] the cognitive space and that's something
[00:08:24] that I'm very passionate about actually
[00:08:25] bringing the two together because I
[00:08:27] think they complement each other but
[00:08:28] that hasn't happened right now yet in
[00:08:30] the main space when I consult schools or
[00:08:32] organizations no one is really bringing
[00:08:33] them together and for that reason I'd
[00:08:35] say just inquiry based learning by
[00:08:36] itself the way it's implemented now very
[00:08:38] overrated
[00:08:40] regular exercise is very very underrated
[00:08:42] and it's underrated for more reason than
[00:08:44] people would think so the obvious
[00:08:45] reasons is like it keeps you healthy
[00:08:47] some less known reasons might be that it
[00:08:49] helps you to focus improves your
[00:08:50] efficiency and actually improves the
[00:08:51] studies that's shown that aerobic
[00:08:53] exercise increases your cognitive
[00:08:54] performance as well but the other thing
[00:08:56] is that there's something called
[00:08:57] adaptive thermogenesis which means that
[00:08:59] even for purely thinking about exercise
[00:09:01] as a tool to like lose weight or get fit
[00:09:04] some people will just say like well diet
[00:09:06] is the most important thing and diet is
[00:09:07] important but actually adaptive
[00:09:09] thermogenesis tells us that it's a
[00:09:10] losing game only thinking about diet
[00:09:12] because your body gets more efficient
[00:09:14] with less calories so it means that your
[00:09:17] metabolic rate will start going down and
[00:09:18] down and down so if you are on a diet
[00:09:20] you will you will get short-term benefit
[00:09:22] but then eventually your body will adapt
[00:09:24] to having low calories and so it won't
[00:09:25] be burning anymore because it's not
[00:09:26] spending as many calories to do the same
[00:09:28] type of cellular activities and so then
[00:09:30] over time you have to then eat less and
[00:09:32] less and less and less and less and so
[00:09:33] then you end up eating like very like
[00:09:35] very very little and then you don't even
[00:09:36] have any energy and now your quality of
[00:09:38] life is affected even more than it was
[00:09:39] before so for that reason as well I
[00:09:42] think regular exercise is underrated
[00:09:43] people learning
[00:09:45] YouTube for learning is this is probably
[00:09:48] this is probably an interesting view
[00:09:49] because I am like an educator on YouTube
[00:09:51] but I actually think YouTube for
[00:09:53] learning is actually overrated because
[00:09:55] it's actually very hard to teach
[00:09:58] something complex through YouTube I'm
[00:10:01] not talking about Concepts you can you
[00:10:03] can create a playlist of Concepts but
[00:10:05] it's very hard to teach skills on
[00:10:08] YouTube because a lot of skill
[00:10:10] development requires like pattern
[00:10:12] identification finding mistakes getting
[00:10:14] feedback like doing stuff offline with
[00:10:17] what you learned online and from a
[00:10:19] education at scale perspective that's
[00:10:23] really really hard to facilitate like
[00:10:24] it's hard to know whether people have
[00:10:26] got the right understanding and to track
[00:10:27] it and to encourage them to do various
[00:10:29] activities and get feedback on that
[00:10:30] through a platform like YouTube I think
[00:10:33] for declarative knowledge only where
[00:10:34] it's just purely about just learning
[00:10:36] some Concepts YouTube is good but I'm
[00:10:38] still saying I'm overrated because of
[00:10:39] the fact that everyone knows you can
[00:10:41] learn everything on YouTube like no
[00:10:42] one's out there not knowing that you can
[00:10:43] learn things on YouTube so people will
[00:10:45] know it but I think people overestimate
[00:10:48] how much you can learn there are certain
[00:10:51] skills that to learn on YouTube maybe
[00:10:54] only two to three percent of the
[00:10:56] population would actually really be able
[00:10:58] to learn it to to that level and that's
[00:11:00] the reason why if you want to learn you
[00:11:02] know Muay Thai or Jiu Jitsu or you want
[00:11:04] to learn to be a great violinist or a
[00:11:07] Pianist or something you're not just
[00:11:09] going on YouTube like the people that
[00:11:10] are able to do that and become a very
[00:11:12] good that thing are very very very few
[00:11:16] compared to the number of people that
[00:11:17] are doing it and often if you are
[00:11:19] someone that is like an instructor of
[00:11:20] these things you'll know that there are
[00:11:21] a lot of people that start learning on
[00:11:23] YouTube and they come to you and the
[00:11:24] technique is terrible and actually they
[00:11:25] now need to like unlearn a lot of those
[00:11:27] mistakes and relearn things so that can
[00:11:30] be quite problematic
[00:11:31] social media is super overrated I mean
[00:11:33] do I need to explain that it's just like
[00:11:35] it's really just bad for your brain you
[00:11:37] know honestly unless you're following me
[00:11:39] in that case that's underrated so that's
[00:11:40] it for this episode of overrated
[00:11:41] underrated if there's anything that I
[00:11:43] mentioned that you want me to dive into
[00:11:44] in more detail please leave a comment
[00:11:46] down below let me know what it is that
[00:11:48] you want me to dive into and also
[00:11:49] specify the question about what aspect
[00:11:53] of it you want me to dive into in the
[00:11:54] very very first overrated underrated
[00:11:56] video that we did for this I just said
[00:11:58] leave a comment below on what you want
[00:11:59] me to expand on people just said like
[00:12:01] the word expand on it and I was like
[00:12:03] what about it so that that was my fault
[00:12:05] this time be a little bit more specific
[00:12:07] but anyway thank you for watching if you
[00:12:08] like this stuff leave a like leave a

=== The Truth About Studying at Cafes ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ns6giD2QUw

[00:00:00] the main thing is not the fact that it's
[00:00:01] a cafe the main thing is that you came
[00:00:03] to a new environment that has tied to a
[00:00:07] certain intention it's not like saying
[00:00:08] if you are at a cafe there's something
[00:00:10] about the cafe environment that just
[00:00:12] magically makes you focus in going to a
[00:00:14] new location that specifically puts you
[00:00:16] in an environment where the reason you
[00:00:18] came to that environment was for another
[00:00:20] intention and where you're free from
[00:00:22] potential distractors for me and for a
[00:00:24] lot of other people when you go to a
[00:00:26] cafe there's nothing else to do because
[00:00:27] you can only eat so much food and drink
[00:00:28] so much coffee so if you're there with
[00:00:30] your stuff you set up and you're in an
[00:00:32] environment maybe you've got your
[00:00:33] headphones on there's less distractions
[00:00:35] and you're in an environment that's
[00:00:36] primed for your intention the very Act
[00:00:39] of literally moving around going
[00:00:41] somewhere else and just changing things
[00:00:42] up is enough to give you a mental break
[00:00:44] reset recalibrate and then refocus


=== I was called a liar. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKmdGe8Kr0g

[00:00:00] yes I've been able to perform very
[00:00:02] highly when I entered into Medical
[00:00:03] School my grades were like essentially
[00:00:04] perfect however for those of you that
[00:00:06] are familiar with my story I had to
[00:00:07] study a lot I studied all the time I was
[00:00:11] studying constantly and if you think
[00:00:13] about it if I was truly so smart I
[00:00:17] wouldn't have needed to do all of that
[00:00:20] to perform well the fact that I had to
[00:00:24] study so much like a lot of people will
[00:00:26] leave comments underneath some of the
[00:00:27] videos that I upload saying like that's
[00:00:28] stupid like you don't need to study that
[00:00:30] much to enter into medical school you
[00:00:31] don't need to like and you're right you
[00:00:33] don't need to study that much the only
[00:00:35] reason I had to was because I wasn't
[00:00:37] just naturally smart enough to do it
[00:00:40] like I had to make up for that was just
[00:00:42] working more and more and more and more
[00:00:43] and I was actually like the lucky one
[00:00:46] like I could at least overcompensate and
[00:00:48] get that result


=== The harsh reality for most students ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V1ucCW90nE

[00:00:00] if you are using the techniques that
[00:00:03] other people are already using like
[00:00:05] you're doing your flash cards you're
[00:00:06] studying the hours and you're writing
[00:00:07] your notes and you are still not
[00:00:09] achieving at a certain level that you
[00:00:10] want to be achieving what does that mean
[00:00:12] like the only logical conclusion there
[00:00:14] if you think that's the best possible
[00:00:16] method is that you're just too dumb so
[00:00:19] you could either believe that or you
[00:00:21] could believe the alternative which is
[00:00:23] that maybe the methods aren't as good as
[00:00:26] you think they are maybe the people that
[00:00:28] are successful with those methods are
[00:00:30] able to be successful not because of
[00:00:32] those methods but they're able to be
[00:00:34] successful despite those methods


=== You're not dumb, your methods are ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjhPKfL90Y

[00:00:00] it's not like I'm a stupid person and
[00:00:02] therefore I can't achieve it's like I am
[00:00:04] capable of achieving I just don't have
[00:00:05] the right tool I'm just not familiar
[00:00:07] with the right process I think that's a
[00:00:10] much better way of thinking about the
[00:00:11] situation rather than assuming that the
[00:00:14] most common methods that everyone uses
[00:00:16] are the best which the research that
[00:00:18] itself says is not the case rather than
[00:00:20] thinking that that's the case and then
[00:00:22] and then you're just too dumb I think
[00:00:24] it's better to think that hey maybe it's
[00:00:25] just my methods just like how I'm now
[00:00:27] good at doing IQ tests not because I'm
[00:00:30] naturally so smart but because I just
[00:00:32] got really good at that test if you get
[00:00:34] good at thinking about math you become
[00:00:37] good at math it's kind of really a way
[00:00:39] of like fake it till you make it


=== What's more important than learning skills? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guev0Vl06BM

[00:00:00] the learning skills are often less
[00:00:02] relevant and less important than the
[00:00:04] learning enablers these are the things
[00:00:06] like the mindset and the perspectives
[00:00:08] the time management the task management
[00:00:09] the prioritization the growth mindset
[00:00:11] because without those someone that
[00:00:13] doesn't have good learning skills would
[00:00:15] never be able to develop better learning
[00:00:17] skills

[00:00:00] hard work beats talent I don't believe
[00:00:02] in Talent I'm here because I worked hard
[00:00:04] my whole life hard work
[00:00:06] Talent
[00:00:07] [Music]
[00:00:09] okay but
[00:00:10] what if what if
[00:00:12] it doesn't what if hard work does not
[00:00:15] beat talent in this video I'm going to
[00:00:18] be telling you four reasons why hard
[00:00:20] work in reality very rarely beats Talent
[00:00:24] at least in the way that most people
[00:00:26] think about that statement and then at
[00:00:28] the end of this video I'm going to give
[00:00:29] you two ways that you can find the
[00:00:31] missing ingredient that does allow hard
[00:00:34] work to beat Talent the missing
[00:00:36] ingredient that if you were to miss
[00:00:38] would mean that your hard work will
[00:00:40] probably be very likely to not beat
[00:00:44] talent for those of you that are new I'm
[00:00:46] Dr Justin sung I'm a former medical
[00:00:48] doctor and full-time learning coach and
[00:00:50] for the last decade I have worked with
[00:00:52] thousands of Learners around the world
[00:00:54] to teach them to learn more efficiently
[00:00:56] so here's the thing about hard work and
[00:00:57] talent when I was 18 trying to enter
[00:00:59] into medical school I studied a lot I
[00:01:01] tell the story all the time I was
[00:01:03] studying 15 20 hours a day very very
[00:01:05] very little sleep yes it is very
[00:01:08] unhealthy uh no it is not a good way to
[00:01:11] live I was not having a good time my
[00:01:12] efficiency was terrible but at the time
[00:01:14] 18 year old me I really didn't know
[00:01:16] anything about efficient study methods
[00:01:17] at all I had you know like writing lots
[00:01:20] and lots and lots and lots of notes just
[00:01:21] a lot of time reading through textbooks
[00:01:23] and writing notes and doing my flash
[00:01:24] cards so when I was entering to medical
[00:01:26] school I managed to get good grades good
[00:01:28] enough grades to get into medical school
[00:01:29] but I also had friends that were
[00:01:31] studying like half the amount of time
[00:01:32] while studying and they were getting in
[00:01:34] some cases even better grades so you
[00:01:36] could say that they were more talented
[00:01:37] than I was but my hard work allowed me
[00:01:39] to overcome that having said that I also
[00:01:41] had a lot of other people around me that
[00:01:43] were studying more than these friends
[00:01:45] and they weren't able to overcome it so
[00:01:48] what's the difference fast forward a few
[00:01:49] years well several years I'm doing my
[00:01:51] master of education I made some videos
[00:01:52] about that as well and I spent about 15
[00:01:55] of the amount of time studying for my
[00:01:57] master of education compared to the
[00:01:58] other people in my cohort I was doing a
[00:02:00] full-time master of education and
[00:02:02] actually putting in less hours than the
[00:02:04] part-time requirement significantly less
[00:02:06] time and at the end I graduated top of
[00:02:07] my cohort I got the dean's award for
[00:02:09] academic Excellence I was a top
[00:02:10] graduating student my grades were
[00:02:11] essentially perfect which is while I was
[00:02:12] invited back to Monash to actually
[00:02:14] lecture people on the skills that I use
[00:02:16] and I continue to do that today but one
[00:02:18] of my peers in the master of education
[00:02:20] group I know that she quit her job to do
[00:02:23] this full-time she was studying 60 hours
[00:02:26] a week for this Masters and she was
[00:02:28] still struggling and she did not manage
[00:02:30] to get really even close to the grades
[00:02:32] that I got so in her instance if she had
[00:02:34] just studied even more instead of 60
[00:02:36] hours maybe if she did a hundred hours
[00:02:38] would she have caught up or beaten me
[00:02:40] probably not because even as it is she
[00:02:44] was putting in like 10 times the amount
[00:02:46] of hard work compared to me and so
[00:02:48] clearly the formula for success is not
[00:02:50] simply hard work times Talent there's a
[00:02:53] missing ingredient here in fact eight
[00:02:55] years ago when I first started getting
[00:02:57] into the education space I set up my
[00:02:58] first company it was a non-profit social
[00:03:00] Enterprise and the whole premise was can
[00:03:03] we teach younger students in high school
[00:03:05] especially from underprivileged
[00:03:06] backgrounds some of the skills on how to
[00:03:08] use their effort more effectively and
[00:03:11] the reason I said that company up was
[00:03:13] because I started noticing so many
[00:03:15] students from these lower socioeconomic
[00:03:17] positions that went to these less
[00:03:18] academic schools coming into uni and
[00:03:21] they were really really struggling and
[00:03:23] it was certainly not because of a lack
[00:03:24] of effort that they weren't doing very
[00:03:26] well it actually felt from my
[00:03:28] perspective that their hard work seemed
[00:03:30] to be futile and the thing is that I now
[00:03:33] know that this is true hard work can be
[00:03:37] futile you can work hard and still do
[00:03:40] poorly and what that causes is a lot of
[00:03:42] stress and a lot of anxiety and a lot of
[00:03:44] pressure and over time it makes people
[00:03:45] believe that they are simply incapable
[00:03:48] or not smart enough or not good enough
[00:03:50] and that is just not true we like to say
[00:03:53] that hard work beats talent because it
[00:03:56] is a message of hope I get that but it
[00:03:59] is oversimplified or at least people see
[00:04:01] it in a way that is oversimplified
[00:04:03] especially young people putting in a lot
[00:04:06] of work they think the answer if they're
[00:04:08] not doing well is to Simply work harder
[00:04:11] and this is especially true in a lot of
[00:04:13] Asian countries it's just part of the
[00:04:15] culture so let me tell you the problems
[00:04:17] with that approach reason number one is
[00:04:19] that hard work has diminishing returns
[00:04:22] when you put in a little bit of work if
[00:04:24] you start from having nowhere to doing a
[00:04:27] decent amount of work you're getting
[00:04:28] really good returns however if you go
[00:04:30] from having high amounts of work to even
[00:04:33] more work you're gonna get less bang for
[00:04:36] your buck every extra hour you're
[00:04:37] putting in is giving you less results
[00:04:39] and at a certain point it actually
[00:04:42] starts being worse more hours actually
[00:04:44] makes you perform worse so for example
[00:04:47] if you were to study 180 hours a week is
[00:04:51] that even possible let me just think
[00:04:52] about this
[00:04:53] if you were to study 140 hours a week
[00:04:57] then you would be so so sleep deprived
[00:05:00] that your cognitive ability is probably
[00:05:02] in like 10 20 of what it would be at its
[00:05:05] peak and so really at that point you may
[00:05:07] as well have only studied like 10 hours
[00:05:09] a week and you'd probably do just the
[00:05:11] same now here's the thing in the low
[00:05:13] levels of competition especially like
[00:05:15] Junior High School it's enough just to
[00:05:18] have some hard work because most people
[00:05:19] around you are just not working hard so
[00:05:21] if you're the person that's putting in
[00:05:23] seven or eight out of ten effort well
[00:05:25] everyone around you is putting in two or
[00:05:26] three out of ten effort then you're
[00:05:28] probably gonna do better than them but
[00:05:30] this is not the case usually later in
[00:05:32] life a lot of people feel this in their
[00:05:34] seniors of high school going to College
[00:05:36] University with things a little bit more
[00:05:37] challenging certainly in you know the
[00:05:39] professional world just putting in more
[00:05:41] time and more effort is not really
[00:05:43] enough to change things enough and part
[00:05:45] of this is because usually for things
[00:05:48] that are difficult and competitive
[00:05:49] people with Talent are not doing two or
[00:05:51] three out of ten effort they are also
[00:05:53] putting in five or six out of ten effort
[00:05:55] so if the difference in Talent between
[00:05:58] you and this other person is too much
[00:05:59] you just cannot compensate for it there
[00:06:01] is not enough time to give and the other
[00:06:04] side is that the person with Talent has
[00:06:06] stuff left in reserve if they notice
[00:06:09] that they're starting to fall behind
[00:06:10] they can go from a 5 out of 10 to a 7
[00:06:12] out of 10 and then beat the competition
[00:06:14] again they have stuff left in the tank
[00:06:16] whereas if you are at 9 out of 10 just
[00:06:18] to keep up that's not going to be
[00:06:20] sustainable and so far if this is making
[00:06:21] sense to you then I would appreciate if
[00:06:23] you leave a like because it helps this
[00:06:25] video reach more people reason number
[00:06:26] two is that effort is fuel hard work is
[00:06:29] important but it's more of a
[00:06:31] prerequisite for example if a machine
[00:06:34] doesn't perform very well and it
[00:06:35] produces low quality products with half
[00:06:38] a tank of gas does it get better just
[00:06:41] because you add more fuel to it so for
[00:06:43] something like studying and learning
[00:06:45] spending more time and effort on using
[00:06:47] methods that aren't Well Suited and
[00:06:49] optimized can actually make things worse
[00:06:51] the classic example that I often give is
[00:06:53] Flash card over Alliance we know that
[00:06:56] flashcards are an excellent tool for its
[00:06:58] purpose you can root memorize lower
[00:07:01] order facts and details especially in
[00:07:04] the short term but beyond that
[00:07:05] relational thinking conceptual thinking
[00:07:07] complex problem solving deeper
[00:07:09] application or having better long-term
[00:07:10] memory we know that this is not a good
[00:07:12] tool but lots of students over rely on
[00:07:14] this and actually in some cases that's
[00:07:16] the only technique that they have in
[00:07:18] their Arsenal and this means that we can
[00:07:19] easily become overwhelmed because the
[00:07:21] brain's ability to just prune out
[00:07:23] unnecessary of relevant information
[00:07:25] which is what the brain thinks about
[00:07:27] stuff that you're just repeatedly
[00:07:28] cramming in through flashcards your
[00:07:30] brain's ability to do that is much much
[00:07:32] more efficient and faster than your
[00:07:35] ability to just do and repeat more of
[00:07:37] the same flashcards you're never gonna
[00:07:39] win against your brain in fact research
[00:07:41] on forgetting curves shows that
[00:07:43] irrelevant information can be pruned
[00:07:44] from the brain within seconds to minutes
[00:07:47] at most which is why it can feel like
[00:07:49] you're constantly fighting against your
[00:07:51] memory because you actually are but then
[00:07:53] Justin isn't that better than nothing
[00:07:54] well yes it's better than nothing but
[00:07:56] it's not better than the alternative see
[00:07:59] if we commit all of this time to using
[00:08:01] that strategy and we're taking time away
[00:08:03] from using other strategies that might
[00:08:05] be more beneficial for different
[00:08:06] purposes and so you can easily see how
[00:08:08] just thinking harder work is the
[00:08:10] solution can be problematic we can use a
[00:08:13] method that's not giving us good results
[00:08:14] and therefore we think the reason is
[00:08:16] because we're not using that enough so
[00:08:18] we just put more time and more effort
[00:08:20] into it and so here's a rule of thumb
[00:08:21] that I follow for myself and for any
[00:08:23] students that I work with if the amount
[00:08:25] of effort you're putting in is
[00:08:26] reasonable for example if you're in high
[00:08:27] school I'd say 10 to 20 hours a week of
[00:08:29] studying is pretty reasonable and you're
[00:08:31] not getting consistent or predictable or
[00:08:34] desirable results then your methods can
[00:08:37] probably be optimized in fact for most
[00:08:39] things in life you should be able to get
[00:08:40] pretty predictable and consistent
[00:08:42] results with only a decent amount of
[00:08:45] effort if you have the right method and
[00:08:48] then once you know that this entire
[00:08:49] system works and as well tuned then you
[00:08:51] can start pumping more fuel into it more
[00:08:53] time time and more energy and this is
[00:08:55] actually kind of intuitive we probably
[00:08:57] already know this a famous example is
[00:08:59] the late great Kobe Bryant you know one
[00:09:01] of the greatest NBA basketball players
[00:09:04] of all time I guess some people would
[00:09:05] debate that I'm not really a basketball
[00:09:06] guy but that's what I hear but the thing
[00:09:08] about Kobe is that he was always always
[00:09:11] practicing he was like famous to be a
[00:09:13] hard worker in fact there's actually the
[00:09:14] story that I saw like a clip of before
[00:09:16] where another NBA player decided to come
[00:09:19] in early to training and then he got
[00:09:21] there at like 4 or 5 a.m and he found
[00:09:23] that Kobe was already there practicing
[00:09:25] and then he you know trained all day and
[00:09:27] then when it was time to go home Kobe
[00:09:29] was still there training and then when
[00:09:31] he asked him why did you train so late
[00:09:34] that night Kobe is said to have replied
[00:09:37] because I want you to know that I will
[00:09:39] always work harder than you so after the
[00:09:41] news I'm like hey cob like why why were
[00:09:44] you in the gym for so long he's like
[00:09:46] because I saw you come in
[00:09:49] and I I don't want you to know that it
[00:09:51] doesn't matter how hard you work that
[00:09:53] I'm willing to work harder than you and
[00:09:56] let's just take a moment to appreciate
[00:09:57] that that is a badass statement and Kobe
[00:10:00] is a beast of a man however what's also
[00:10:03] implicit there is that Kobe one of the
[00:10:06] best basketball players in the world
[00:10:08] using one of the best facilities in the
[00:10:11] world being coached by a world-class you
[00:10:14] know coaching team is probably
[00:10:16] practicing using methods that are pretty
[00:10:19] good which is why Talent aside just
[00:10:22] because you practice as much as he did
[00:10:24] it doesn't mean that you're gonna be an
[00:10:26] NBA player which brings me to reason
[00:10:28] number three which is that hard work is
[00:10:30] also about the type of work that you do
[00:10:33] and the way that I like to explain this
[00:10:34] is using the term asset when we work
[00:10:37] hard we want to build an asset in
[00:10:40] financial terms you can consider an
[00:10:41] asset as something that allows you to
[00:10:43] improve the amount of cash that you can
[00:10:45] earn without needing to do more work so
[00:10:48] for example example if you buy a very
[00:10:51] rare and precious Jewel like a diamond
[00:10:53] and that diamond increases in value when
[00:10:55] you sell it you've made a profit that
[00:10:57] diamond has by just the value of it
[00:11:00] existing made money for you so it's an
[00:11:03] asset so we should also think about
[00:11:04] spending time to invest in our own
[00:11:07] personal skill assets imagine two
[00:11:10] Lumberjacks that are trying to cut down
[00:11:12] some trees one may spend all of their
[00:11:14] time and effort on just cutting down the
[00:11:16] trees while another may spend half of
[00:11:18] their time and effort on sharpening
[00:11:20] their ax over time the person with a
[00:11:22] sharper X is going to be more efficient
[00:11:24] and they're going to win if these two
[00:11:25] Lumberjacks are competing but both
[00:11:27] Lumberjacks worked very hard in fact
[00:11:30] some might even say that the one that
[00:11:32] spent all of their time just swinging
[00:11:34] their blunt acts around was working
[00:11:36] harder which is why we often say work
[00:11:38] smarter not harder I believe it actually
[00:11:41] should be work smarter and then once
[00:11:44] you've figured out how to work smarter
[00:11:45] then feel free if you want to to work
[00:11:48] hard as well well and then you become
[00:11:50] Unstoppable and so even though hard work
[00:11:51] can beat talent and even though the
[00:11:53] statement hard work beats Talent can
[00:11:55] give people hope in reality it can
[00:11:57] actually do the opposite it can rob
[00:11:59] people of Hope if you only see hard work
[00:12:01] and talent as a two parts of the
[00:12:03] equation to success whatever success
[00:12:05] means to you because really the equation
[00:12:07] should be success equals hard work times
[00:12:09] Talent times your processes in fact you
[00:12:12] could even say that Talent is simply
[00:12:15] just the natural ability for someone to
[00:12:18] intuitively use more optimal processes
[00:12:21] think about that
[00:12:23] and so here are two things that you can
[00:12:25] do to help turn your effort more
[00:12:27] consistently into results and give
[00:12:29] yourself the chance for your hard work
[00:12:31] to beat Talent first one is to pull back
[00:12:33] if you're already at a hundred percent
[00:12:36] capacity you do not have the time to
[00:12:38] invest to learn how to work smarter to
[00:12:41] sharpen your ex you need time to sharpen
[00:12:43] your racks and what that means is that
[00:12:45] sometimes you actually have to accept
[00:12:47] the short-term loss you have to accept
[00:12:50] that maybe right now in the short term
[00:12:52] you may not perform as well as you want
[00:12:55] to and I know that can be really really
[00:12:56] difficult for some people but if you
[00:12:58] don't spend the time to improve your
[00:13:01] skills and learn how to work smarter
[00:13:04] then you're going to be stuck in the
[00:13:05] spiral forever there's going to be no
[00:13:07] hope for you because you're never
[00:13:09] improving the future version of you is
[00:13:11] always stuck with the same problems with
[00:13:13] the current version of your hairs plus
[00:13:15] the new problems the future version of
[00:13:17] you has inherited if right now you feel
[00:13:19] like you're not able to stay on top of
[00:13:20] things and that means that you are
[00:13:22] giving the future version of you the
[00:13:24] things that you weren't able to deal
[00:13:25] with today to deal with later the future
[00:13:27] version of you has all those same things
[00:13:29] to deal with plus the stuff that you
[00:13:31] weren't able to deal with before but if
[00:13:33] your ability to deal with it is not
[00:13:35] improving that backlog just build and
[00:13:38] builds and builds and that's why we can
[00:13:40] get overwhelmed and so this is what
[00:13:41] short-term pain long-term gain really
[00:13:44] means it doesn't mean just put your head
[00:13:46] down and work hard right now so that you
[00:13:48] can get a good result later it means
[00:13:50] accept defeat now lose the game so that
[00:13:54] you can win the championship which
[00:13:55] brings us to number two which is to know
[00:13:58] more things a lot of people will say
[00:14:00] that I don't know how to work smarter so
[00:14:02] I can't I don't know what to do but it
[00:14:04] doesn't stop you from taking the next
[00:14:06] step which is to learn what to do to
[00:14:08] gain more information about that if the
[00:14:10] reason that you can't work smarter is
[00:14:12] you don't know how your next step is to
[00:14:15] know how so maybe you're not taking time
[00:14:18] to sharpen your ex maybe that time is
[00:14:21] spent on learning how to shop an ax
[00:14:23] which would lead to you being able to
[00:14:26] sharpen your ex taking action is rarely
[00:14:28] about changing your action immediately
[00:14:31] most of the time especially for things
[00:14:32] that are difficult or complicated taking
[00:14:34] action means making the decision to
[00:14:37] learn what action you should take so if
[00:14:40] you want to learn how to improve your
[00:14:44] learning or studying efficiency and work
[00:14:46] smarter in that way then you might be
[00:14:48] interested in checking out my video on
[00:14:49] encoding or if you want to see me apply
[00:14:51] some of these techniques in real life
[00:14:53] for example like I did with my master's
[00:14:55] program I actually documented that and
[00:14:56] you can check out that video here as
[00:14:58] well as always if you found this useful
[00:15:00] leave a thumbs up share it with your
[00:15:01] friends I appreciate your support thanks
[00:15:03] for watching and I'll see you next time

=== You need to start loving your mistakes ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0pomVqvqUE

[00:00:00] the primary outcome of Peak Performance
[00:00:02] is the ability to engage in and thrive
[00:00:04] in and work with your mistakes at a very
[00:00:06] fast frequency rather than the outcome
[00:00:08] it's the understanding that we all have
[00:00:10] as professionals that the outcome is a
[00:00:12] symptom of the process if we all know
[00:00:14] that but it's there's a sense of
[00:00:16] insecurity especially from a business's
[00:00:17] point of view to say okay so therefore
[00:00:19] we're actually going to use that as the
[00:00:21] primary metric for Success because you
[00:00:23] need the outcomes at the end of the day
[00:00:24] so you need to have in a way that belief
[00:00:26] that yes if we just triple down and
[00:00:28] process you know mistake finding
[00:00:30] Behavior the outcome will become better
[00:00:32] over time and it creates a really great
[00:00:34] culture as well


=== This is the easiest way to stand out ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOlh4mpxi0A

[00:00:00] it is not hard to stand out especially
[00:00:03] if you are a student try to be involved
[00:00:05] in some kind of project of some sort it
[00:00:09] doesn't really even matter what it is as
[00:00:11] long as it's not crazy whatever you
[00:00:13] really want to do you don't have to even
[00:00:15] be good at it the idea here is that you
[00:00:17] want to demonstrate that you are the
[00:00:19] type of person that is willing to engage
[00:00:22] a little bit more than the bare minimum
[00:00:24] for something that you are interested in
[00:00:26] and obviously there's going to be great
[00:00:28] you know skill development from from
[00:00:29] doing stuff like that as well


=== Learning Expert Reacts to Top Medical Student Advice ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsIoSapOj6g

[00:00:00] the best revision method for lazy
[00:00:01] students crosswords I like this just
[00:00:04] because it seems fun I want to do one I
[00:00:07] hate when people say the best way to do
[00:00:09] something uh don't tell me this is the
[00:00:12] ah hey guys it's Dr Justin here again
[00:00:15] and this is part three of me reacting to
[00:00:17] tick tock study advice if you're new to
[00:00:19] this channel I am a learning coach
[00:00:21] learning researcher certified teacher
[00:00:23] and the head of learning that I can
[00:00:24] study and a former medical doctor over
[00:00:26] the last decade I have helped tens of
[00:00:28] thousands of Learners across the world
[00:00:29] learn more efficiently so here's my take
[00:00:31] on this advice and this part three I
[00:00:34] think has probably the most high value
[00:00:36] like generally good advice compared to
[00:00:40] the the first two parts so hope you
[00:00:42] enjoy here's the study method that I use
[00:00:44] in medical school to learn everything
[00:00:46] this four-step method will help you
[00:00:48] master any material no matter what
[00:00:49] subject you're learning or what level
[00:00:51] you're at step one I watched the lecture
[00:00:53] on 1.5 to 2x speed and take notes my
[00:00:56] goal of the first pass is simply to
[00:00:57] understand the material rather than
[00:00:59] memorize every single fact the lecture
[00:01:01] is needed just try to get a basic
[00:01:03] overview of okay here's a hack that I'm
[00:01:05] gonna use I'm gonna tell you about that
[00:01:07] just takes that to another level what
[00:01:09] they've said so far that actually sounds
[00:01:10] good right like the focus is being on
[00:01:12] The Superficial General broad base
[00:01:14] here's two more things that you can add
[00:01:16] if you've got multiple lectures that are
[00:01:17] talking about essentially the same
[00:01:18] concept and the same topic do all of
[00:01:20] them at once if you can because you'll
[00:01:22] find more relationships between them
[00:01:24] than if you were to just do a single
[00:01:25] lecture sometimes there's something that
[00:01:27] you look at and you're like it takes you
[00:01:28] 15 minutes to just get your head around
[00:01:29] that but then actually three lectures
[00:01:31] later if you had known that information
[00:01:33] it would have made this so much easier
[00:01:34] to understand
[00:01:35] learning like broadly and superficially
[00:01:38] at the beginning is always better than
[00:01:40] going narrow and deep anyway the the tip
[00:01:42] here download the lecture if you can put
[00:01:45] it into an AI to transcribe it into
[00:01:47] words and then just read it it's faster
[00:01:50] than doing 1.5 or double speed just try
[00:01:52] to get a basic overview of the
[00:01:54] information use the free Google Chrome
[00:01:56] extension video screen controller to
[00:01:58] watch electrics faster step two I review
[00:02:00] the PowerPoint lecture and the notes
[00:02:01] that I took and I used them to make
[00:02:03] flashcards on a free apps
[00:02:07] because team yourself the material is
[00:02:09] one of the best ways to learn rather
[00:02:10] than saying what is the mitochondria I
[00:02:13] say what specific function of the
[00:02:15] mitochondria is conducive to life okay
[00:02:17] so all right like there was a Redemption
[00:02:19] here I was like oh we just immediately
[00:02:21] dropped into isolated lower what a
[00:02:23] non-integrated you know space retrieval
[00:02:25] methods but actually the spin that he
[00:02:28] took on it is much much better and this
[00:02:30] is a way that most people aren't really
[00:02:32] using flashcards so what what he's done
[00:02:34] is that he's created integration he's
[00:02:36] created connection and relationships
[00:02:37] between the information so it's not just
[00:02:39] isolated Factory call it requires more
[00:02:41] what we call elaboration and that's
[00:02:43] going to be a lot better for your
[00:02:44] learning than just a simple simple
[00:02:46] isolated one so well done um whatever
[00:02:49] your name was something Nosh right knee
[00:02:51] I think I said that name wrong
[00:02:55] um but the other thing is that you
[00:02:57] should you should um sort of refresh
[00:02:59] your flashcard questions every now and
[00:03:01] again if you're going to use this
[00:03:02] technique and again I still think that
[00:03:04] going straight to flashcards is probably
[00:03:07] premature because you're gonna have so
[00:03:09] many and like you're gonna spend all
[00:03:10] your all of your time doing that but if
[00:03:12] you are really gonna do that then make
[00:03:14] sure you've refreshed the refresh the
[00:03:15] questions the issue is that you can get
[00:03:17] into like a a pattern of queued recall
[00:03:20] only and what that means is that you can
[00:03:22] have a certain question you memorize the
[00:03:24] answer to that single question and
[00:03:26] you're no longer actually testing on the
[00:03:28] relationships anymore so like a great
[00:03:30] way that you know if this has happened
[00:03:31] is that you read a question like this
[00:03:33] and at the first point you read that
[00:03:35] question you might think about it and be
[00:03:37] like hmm I wonder what it is and try to
[00:03:38] answer it and the second time you're
[00:03:39] like wait what were the relationships
[00:03:41] that I thought of there and then you
[00:03:42] answer it again but maybe like the
[00:03:43] fourth time that you answer it you're
[00:03:45] just reading this what specific function
[00:03:46] of the Mito and then you already
[00:03:48] remember what it is and you can answer
[00:03:50] it straight away and what that indicates
[00:03:51] is that it's now a pattern recognition
[00:03:53] thing you're no longer thinking about or
[00:03:55] testing yourself on the relationships so
[00:03:57] rather than doing the same thing it's
[00:03:58] better to change the question so modify
[00:04:01] that question now or add a new flash
[00:04:02] card and get rid of this one and swap it
[00:04:04] out so instead of what specific function
[00:04:06] of the mitochondria is conducive to life
[00:04:07] you could say if the mitochondria did
[00:04:10] not have this specific function how
[00:04:12] might the cell be uh disadvantaged so
[00:04:15] you can see it's like a similar kind of
[00:04:17] question but it's actually testing you
[00:04:19] in a different way so you should be
[00:04:21] always mindful of when you're entering
[00:04:22] into just that pure like trigger
[00:04:24] response pattern recognition because
[00:04:26] that's not really testing on higher
[00:04:28] order structures anymore
[00:04:29] boom creating energy step three I review
[00:04:32] The Flash okay well I mean that was
[00:04:36] the emotional roller coaster this one
[00:04:37] boom creating energy so that's like the
[00:04:39] worst way to answer this question this
[00:04:41] is something that I call importance
[00:04:42] checklisting which is when you have a
[00:04:44] question that makes you do integrated
[00:04:46] thinking but instead of doing the
[00:04:47] integrated thinking you answer it in a
[00:04:49] way that causes you to have a single
[00:04:51] isolated lower order response this is a
[00:04:54] great question to prompt you for more
[00:04:55] elaborative thinking and it is more time
[00:04:58] consuming which is the reason why having
[00:05:00] a high volume flash cards with high
[00:05:01] frequency repetition is not
[00:05:02] mathematically scale like scalable
[00:05:04] sustainable if you're learning lots of
[00:05:06] stuff
[00:05:07] um but if you did have a question like
[00:05:09] this boom creating energy is not a great
[00:05:11] way to to answer it you should elaborate
[00:05:13] a little bit more like but anyway
[00:05:16] I review the flash cards that I made
[00:05:18] this is probably my favorite step
[00:05:19] because it takes the least amount of
[00:05:21] time and it really drills in the
[00:05:22] information step four measuring the
[00:05:24] effectiveness of a strategy based on how
[00:05:27] long it takes is not a great way you
[00:05:30] should be measuring the effectiveness
[00:05:31] based on the type of knowledge that
[00:05:33] helps you create or retrieve and then
[00:05:36] the amount of time it takes to achieve
[00:05:38] that it can if something takes you a
[00:05:40] very short amount of time but it doesn't
[00:05:41] provide a great benefit then it's not
[00:05:43] going to be very effective when this guy
[00:05:45] says review your flashcards I'm sure
[00:05:47] he's doing something in his head that
[00:05:50] makes it more effective and that is
[00:05:52] probably the secret Source behind this
[00:05:54] which is a reason why he's able to use
[00:05:55] these techniques with success is what's
[00:05:58] happening cognitively
[00:05:59] ask a classmate to do an active learning
[00:06:02] session with me in which we ask each
[00:06:03] other practice questions this allows me
[00:06:05] to understand the information from their
[00:06:07] perspective as well and it allows me to
[00:06:08] fill in any gaps that I might have
[00:06:10] missed you can't miss this one because
[00:06:11] it's definitely one of the best steps
[00:06:12] for drilling in there and then but
[00:06:14] that's really good the last one is
[00:06:15] really really good you know it's it's
[00:06:17] got that social learning element it is
[00:06:19] exposing you to more perspective so
[00:06:20] that's a really good step the only
[00:06:22] downside is that you need friends this
[00:06:24] study method has significantly decreased
[00:06:26] my study time and made me way more
[00:06:28] efficient try it out and let me know
[00:06:29] what you think follow me drop a like and
[00:06:31] send this video to a friend who studies
[00:06:33] a lot
[00:06:34] it is a revision technique that I use to
[00:06:36] get Ole stars at GCSE and a level and in
[00:06:38] two years worth of content can almost
[00:06:40] feel impossible so it's really important
[00:06:42] that you have an effective technique to
[00:06:43] condense the course down I did this
[00:06:45] using summary Pages where I'd make a
[00:06:47] single April page for a topic like the
[00:06:49] alkanes and we've forced myself to find
[00:06:51] a way to break everything down so the
[00:06:52] whole course material fit onto that one
[00:06:54] page I have loads more revision
[00:06:55] techniques so we'll make more videos so
[00:06:57] follow that
[00:06:58] cool so I think the main thing with this
[00:07:01] is like as I've said you know summary
[00:07:03] summary Pages work because it forces
[00:07:06] that prioritization evaluation of
[00:07:07] information if you use non-linear
[00:07:09] methods of summarization you're going to
[00:07:10] find that it's more challenging but much
[00:07:12] more effective as well so you know
[00:07:14] that's the additional thing that I add
[00:07:15] to that but I think I've already talked
[00:07:16] about summary Pages a lot
[00:07:18] um through this like set of videos the
[00:07:21] best revision method for lazy students
[00:07:23] crosswords they're so underrated that
[00:07:25] they've gotten through gcses a levels
[00:07:27] and med school there are children that
[00:07:30] let you study entire courses and dance
[00:07:31] here's some examples in container the
[00:07:34] restrooms
[00:07:36] you know what
[00:07:38] I don't know if I'm out of touch
[00:07:41] but I have never seen crossword studying
[00:07:45] like this this type of thing I I have a
[00:07:47] lot of opinions about the fact that it's
[00:07:49] still you know it's essentially just the
[00:07:50] same thing as flashcards right and so
[00:07:51] there's the limitations with isolated
[00:07:53] information and recall and it's not
[00:07:54] really testing your conceptual
[00:07:55] difficulty and networks are integrated
[00:07:57] thoughts so you're not really going to
[00:07:58] get any of the benefits of deep
[00:07:59] processing really unless of course
[00:08:01] you're already a deep processor but if
[00:08:03] you get curveball questions or higher
[00:08:04] level questions you're kind of screwed
[00:08:05] if you only rely on this technique and
[00:08:07] you don't have good deprocessing okay
[00:08:08] that's the Spiel done but this is just
[00:08:10] cool I like this just because it seems
[00:08:13] fun I want to do one this is cool I've
[00:08:15] never seen this before maybe I'm just
[00:08:17] maybe I'm out of touch now
[00:08:21] uh don't tell me this is the
[00:08:24] ah I hate this
[00:08:29] um
[00:08:30] we don't even start so from a research
[00:08:32] perspective there was research that says
[00:08:34] that you know something like the dueling
[00:08:36] method can work because of the fact that
[00:08:37] there is actually like a you know I
[00:08:39] can't remember what you might call it
[00:08:40] like a neuronal Arc I almost you know I
[00:08:42] imagine but there is something with you
[00:08:44] know active literally just moving your
[00:08:46] hands and just doing things and reading
[00:08:47] that allows you to have better
[00:08:50] comprehension of the information the
[00:08:51] main issue with this is that it is
[00:08:53] extremely extremely deep processing
[00:08:56] dependent which means that if you don't
[00:08:59] have really high and good levels of deep
[00:09:01] processing to begin with you will really
[00:09:03] struggle to improve by uh any any like
[00:09:07] real meaningful amount by using this
[00:09:09] method so again if you're struggling
[00:09:10] like you're actually struggling or
[00:09:13] you're just you know you're average and
[00:09:14] you just want to be like and that higher
[00:09:16] tier this is not really the thing that's
[00:09:17] going to change things very much but if
[00:09:19] you're if you're like kind of doing well
[00:09:21] and you just want to like increase the
[00:09:22] engagement when you're specifically
[00:09:24] reading something then this method can
[00:09:26] help you a little bit there's probably
[00:09:27] something like a you know five to ten
[00:09:30] percent benefit in terms of focus and
[00:09:32] comprehension at the point of reading
[00:09:33] but the word comprehension is like it's
[00:09:36] complicated like how do you even measure
[00:09:37] comprehension it's not just you know
[00:09:38] it's not just that you remembered
[00:09:40] something it's about how you can then
[00:09:41] use that information and then how many
[00:09:43] different ways this is not really going
[00:09:44] to help you with that
[00:09:48] I'm looking forward to that the best way
[00:09:51] to learn anything in just three steps
[00:09:53] first is you choose your topic and start
[00:09:56] studying I hate when people say the best
[00:09:58] way to do something you know or an
[00:10:01] imagine like how do you know that
[00:10:02] although teaching it to people is a lot
[00:10:04] like where do you get that confidence
[00:10:06] from better this exercise is definitely
[00:10:09] where you will discover the gaps in your
[00:10:11] knowledge and basically the aim of this
[00:10:13] whole technique is to help you identify
[00:10:15] your weaknesses in a topic and work on
[00:10:17] them harder and turn them into a
[00:10:19] strength
[00:10:21] yeah cool well I mean that's a fireman
[00:10:23] method
[00:10:24] is that Fame no I'm sure it's fine man
[00:10:27] anyway the Feynman method is
[00:10:29] um is a good method I think it's
[00:10:31] probably for uh for like a beginner
[00:10:33] that's just trying to get into effective
[00:10:35] learning strategies it's like one of the
[00:10:36] best techniques that you can use to just
[00:10:38] start getting in there there's a lot of
[00:10:40] great generative effects there's a lot
[00:10:42] of great active recall Active Learning
[00:10:43] retrieval uh benefits from it it's
[00:10:46] forcing some higher order integrated
[00:10:47] information there is a little bit of
[00:10:49] nuance there that it it still really
[00:10:52] depends on your ability to do the Deep
[00:10:54] processing so even though it encourages
[00:10:55] it the defining method doesn't have a
[00:10:57] lot of detailed instruction on how to do
[00:10:58] it especially the teaching step because
[00:11:00] the way you teach something also changes
[00:11:03] the way you think about it so there are
[00:11:05] methods of teaching that force you to
[00:11:07] evaluate it to a deeper level and so
[00:11:09] it's a lot more effective whereas if you
[00:11:10] were to teach something but the way
[00:11:12] you're teaching it is very just like you
[00:11:13] know almost like reading off the
[00:11:14] PowerPoint Style just like very linear
[00:11:16] like here are the facts that's not very
[00:11:18] effective because then you're only
[00:11:20] testing yourself at the lower orders so
[00:11:22] you know there's a lot of variation
[00:11:23] there but for a bit beginner technique
[00:11:25] find my method is is great to start with
[00:11:28] you know if I'm working with someone
[00:11:29] that's got some experience with this I
[00:11:30] know that there's going to be a
[00:11:31] foundation that's a lot easier to work
[00:11:33] with here are the three things I did to
[00:11:35] get a 99.99
[00:11:37] oh and you missed the point ask your
[00:11:40] teachers for extra material like
[00:11:41] challenging practice exam questions
[00:11:45] or application questions so that you're
[00:11:47] not cramming for the end of the video
[00:11:50] okay pretty simple points there don't do
[00:11:52] all the homework necessarily though I
[00:11:54] think she probably benefited from going
[00:11:56] to a school that gave more meaningful
[00:11:58] homework but there are honestly a lot of
[00:12:01] and like look I don't mean this in a way
[00:12:02] that's like Consulting to teachers or
[00:12:03] anything and sometimes it's just it's
[00:12:05] just how things are but sometimes
[00:12:07] homework is just not very useful you
[00:12:10] know there are really great guidelines
[00:12:12] that are especially not evidence-based
[00:12:14] ones on how to set homework that is
[00:12:16] Meaningful that produces good learning a
[00:12:19] lot of it is just kind of like
[00:12:20] the teacher has an idea about something
[00:12:23] and just gives it a go but actually a
[00:12:26] lot of homework is not going to help you
[00:12:28] if you are not studying okay if you're
[00:12:30] not studying in your personal time do
[00:12:32] your homework it's going to help you but
[00:12:33] if it's taking time away from something
[00:12:35] else that you want to be doing that is
[00:12:38] more productive for your studying you've
[00:12:39] got another method that you want to use
[00:12:41] then it depends on the method and
[00:12:43] depends on the homework but usually I
[00:12:45] find that homework then is kind of a
[00:12:47] distractor more so and I wish we had an
[00:12:50] education system that made it easier for
[00:12:52] teachers to just like let students do a
[00:12:55] little bit more of their own thing and
[00:12:56] take a little bit more control of their
[00:12:57] own and ownership over their learning
[00:12:59] rather than like prescribing homework
[00:13:01] but at the same time as someone that
[00:13:03] works with thousands of students like I
[00:13:05] know how hard it is to do that and I
[00:13:07] can't imagine trying to do that in like
[00:13:08] a school setting unless you're in like a
[00:13:10] private school where there's a lot more
[00:13:11] resources and a lot more support
[00:13:13] um but a lot of time homework is not
[00:13:15] really going to help you and actually
[00:13:16] one of the best things that you can do
[00:13:17] for yourself is learn a more effective
[00:13:19] method of self-study and just do your
[00:13:20] homework as fast as you can just so that
[00:13:22] the teacher like checks the box or
[00:13:24] something or negotiate with your teacher
[00:13:25] if they seem like an open-minded person
[00:13:27] be like hey I really want to self-study
[00:13:28] using this method I think it's going to
[00:13:30] be really effective for me is it okay
[00:13:31] for just like the next couple weeks I
[00:13:33] try using this method and then I I talk
[00:13:36] to you about how I'm finding it because
[00:13:37] I feel like it might be more useful for
[00:13:39] me than doing the homework well you know
[00:13:41] if they seem like an open-minded person
[00:13:43] maybe try to give that a go but you know
[00:13:45] that's going to be up to you right I
[00:13:46] don't think any responsibility for you
[00:13:48] know you getting in trouble with your
[00:13:51] teacher if they're like a super super
[00:13:52] conservative like you know like how dare
[00:13:54] you define me kind of personality
[00:13:57] um
[00:13:58] yeah the the next thing asking for a
[00:14:00] more more challenging material this is
[00:14:02] actually good like you I I think every
[00:14:05] student should always hold themselves to
[00:14:06] a higher standard in general it just
[00:14:08] pushes you forward a little bit more and
[00:14:10] learning outside the scope is better for
[00:14:12] your learning overall anyway uh and
[00:14:14] revising on a regular basis this is good
[00:14:16] advice too uh so overall I think there's
[00:14:19] just maybe a little bit of nuance that
[00:14:21] this person is missing based on the fact
[00:14:22] that she probably doesn't have
[00:14:23] experience working with lots of schools
[00:14:25] and students of diverse backgrounds but
[00:14:28] given that it's just coming from her her
[00:14:29] experience and she did say like this is
[00:14:32] how she did it I think it's yeah like
[00:14:34] good advice revising for anything can be
[00:14:37] incredibly stressful so it's my top tips
[00:14:40] to make revision that little bit easier
[00:14:41] and to alleviate some of those choices
[00:14:43] so when I was revising I would always
[00:14:45] get my things from environment so
[00:14:47] definitely go and check those out for
[00:14:48] all of your revision needs my first tip
[00:14:50] is to get some random in so you can map
[00:14:52] out when you're going to do revision
[00:14:54] when you're going to take rest days
[00:14:55] because that's really important when
[00:14:57] you're gonna do mock exams all of those
[00:14:58] things that's good my second tip is to
[00:15:00] get a clock that's just on the table
[00:15:02] it's not your phone so you don't get
[00:15:03] distracted
[00:15:04] your revision time and figure out what's
[00:15:07] next
[00:15:09] what he said next tip get yourself an
[00:15:12] exercise book one that you can divide
[00:15:14] into sections is so useful just for all
[00:15:16] of your original notes but whilst
[00:15:18] revising make it colorful make it but
[00:15:19] you know so so again this is only if
[00:15:21] you're using a linear note-taking style
[00:15:22] but once you start getting into higher
[00:15:24] order learning and that becomes the
[00:15:25] method through which you think like once
[00:15:27] you start understanding the value of
[00:15:29] integrated thinking you will find that
[00:15:31] A4 size paper is just so restrictive and
[00:15:34] it's hard to use so again I I always say
[00:15:36] and I understand not everyone can afford
[00:15:37] it but if you can try to save up to get
[00:15:39] yourself a tablet even if it's like the
[00:15:41] cheapest possible you know like Android
[00:15:42] tablet out there with a tablet with a
[00:15:44] Pen stylus Infinite Canvas is like is a
[00:15:47] game changer for for learning if you are
[00:15:50] using integrative thinking and
[00:15:52] non-linear note taking which really is
[00:15:55] just vastly Superior so useful just for
[00:15:58] all of your audition notes whilst
[00:16:00] revising make it colorful make it stand
[00:16:01] out it's going to help you remember it
[00:16:03] uh I mean the research on that is it
[00:16:05] doesn't really work quite that way but
[00:16:13] stick them everywhere short notes to
[00:16:16] help you remember
[00:16:18] so the final thing that that's not
[00:16:20] really going to be very effective for
[00:16:22] most people unless you've got a very few
[00:16:24] number of things that you're trying to
[00:16:25] remind yourself for if the information
[00:16:27] is very very simple but if you like it's
[00:16:29] quite a niche situation where you'd need
[00:16:31] that if you do really have detailed
[00:16:34] isolated fact related information that
[00:16:36] you're trying to remember you should
[00:16:37] really be using a digital flashcard app
[00:16:39] for those that type of information like
[00:16:40] Anki I actually used to do that though I
[00:16:43] actually used to have stuff like just on
[00:16:44] my mirror so like when I'm brushing my
[00:16:46] teeth and you know I can remember it and
[00:16:48] all I remember is I had the notes up I
[00:16:50] don't remember anything that was on them
[00:16:51] when it comes to revising like properly
[00:16:53] this is something I'm so passionate
[00:16:54] about so I don't care what Tick Tock
[00:16:56] again I hate the best title here it's
[00:16:58] like what how how do you know that why
[00:17:01] are you why are you so confident about
[00:17:02] that what YouTube video what like genius
[00:17:05] that you know that has told you like
[00:17:07] this is the perfect method to revive and
[00:17:09] smash your exam like genuinely there is
[00:17:11] no perfect method that's like
[00:17:15] oh wait so this she's responding to
[00:17:17] someone that is asking what is the best
[00:17:19] technique oh all right I get it sorry my
[00:17:22] bad Christina when it comes to revising
[00:17:24] like properly this is something I'm so
[00:17:26] passionate about so I don't care what
[00:17:27] Tick Tock what YouTube video what like
[00:17:29] genius that you know that has told you
[00:17:32] like this is the perfect method to
[00:17:33] revise and smash your exam like
[00:17:35] genuinely there is no perfect method one
[00:17:38] of the best methods is genuinely to use
[00:17:40] all the methods as in do some flashcards
[00:17:43] make a few posters do some past papers
[00:17:45] do blurting on a whiteboard and fill in
[00:17:47] the bits that you don't know like use
[00:17:48] everything because all methods have
[00:17:50] flaws past papers are great but they're
[00:17:52] not going to cover every single topic
[00:17:54] ever flashcards are great but they do
[00:17:55] get boring after a while the posters are
[00:17:58] great but it does take forever to make a
[00:17:59] poster on the topic each supervision
[00:18:01] technique has their strengths and
[00:18:02] weaknesses so if you can use all of them
[00:18:03] you're going to be covering all bases
[00:18:06] yeah like that's great that's great
[00:18:09] advice I don't have a lot to say about
[00:18:10] that I would say don't use all revision
[00:18:12] methods I know especially in some
[00:18:15] countries there are revision methods
[00:18:17] that are like straight up will not work
[00:18:19] especially in Asia there are some very
[00:18:21] desperate students trying to do stuff uh
[00:18:24] and so like I wouldn't say do everything
[00:18:27] I would say think about the benefit cost
[00:18:30] and benefit of the technique if you know
[00:18:32] the cost and benefit like of a technique
[00:18:34] then you should be able to mix and match
[00:18:35] them and then bring them together into
[00:18:37] your system and make it make a decision
[00:18:38] about that right but I would say think
[00:18:40] about it and then use it and I think
[00:18:42] that's something that was like implicit
[00:18:44] in what she was saying I'm sure she's
[00:18:45] not saying like do all the real crazy
[00:18:47] things but the essence of the message is
[00:18:49] there and I agree with it and so that's
[00:18:51] great advice good advice Christina and
[00:18:54] that's it that that's it we are at the
[00:18:56] end of all the videos if there are
[00:18:58] specific things that you want me to
[00:19:00] review uh let me know but otherwise
[00:19:02] thanks for watching if there's things
[00:19:04] that you want me to go into a little bit
[00:19:05] more depth let me know know in the
[00:19:07] comments and I'll try to make a bigger
[00:19:08] video explaining some of that a little
[00:19:09] bit more if you like these kind of
[00:19:10] reaction videos let me know as well but
[00:19:12] thanks for watching we'll see in the
[00:19:13] next one

=== What is focused meditation? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCq3Rsqsmog

[00:00:00] Focus meditation
[00:00:02] well focused meditation is really a I
[00:00:05] think personally I I think it could be
[00:00:06] viewed as really a subset of mindfulness
[00:00:08] meditation in fact all these meditative
[00:00:10] practices kind of end up sort of
[00:00:12] blending together the only difference is
[00:00:14] the intention behind it and also there
[00:00:16] isn't really clear research that
[00:00:17] differentiates the benefits of different
[00:00:19] forms of meditation from each other so
[00:00:22] if you look at something like
[00:00:24] um like very secular meditation
[00:00:26] practices versus something that's more
[00:00:27] like religious or Transcendental
[00:00:28] Meditation you're not really seeing that
[00:00:30] there are unique differences for each of
[00:00:33] these at least not when you look at the
[00:00:34] research as a whole
[00:00:36] so I think meditation as a as a whole is
[00:00:39] just good to do and if you're wanting to
[00:00:41] use it for Focus whether you wanted to
[00:00:42] use it to calm down whether you want to
[00:00:44] use it to detach or just you know deal
[00:00:46] with anxiety or whatever it is I think
[00:00:48] that's just up to you to pick your
[00:00:49] intention but it's just good overall


=== How to draw and doodle for visual processing? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1wyrLLe3u8

[00:00:00] drawing or doodling drawing or doodling
[00:00:03] is overall
[00:00:05] underrated but most people aren't really
[00:00:09] doodling in a way that is productive
[00:00:11] like most people are doodling like
[00:00:12] making the you know organic chemistry
[00:00:15] it's like oh yeah history like they're
[00:00:17] drawing out you know making it really
[00:00:19] pretty but drawing and doodling is a
[00:00:20] great way of representing information
[00:00:21] non-verbally which is important because
[00:00:23] your visual processing has tens of
[00:00:25] thousands of times faster than your
[00:00:26] written word processing but also because
[00:00:28] of the fact that it allows you to
[00:00:29] express more information in a way that
[00:00:31] is non-directional which is the way that
[00:00:33] knowledge is inherently sort of
[00:00:35] non-linear and omnidirectional so trying
[00:00:37] to represent it linearly means that you
[00:00:38] lock yourself into learning it in a
[00:00:40] linear flow whereas drawings and doodles
[00:00:42] can actually break that open you can
[00:00:43] look at like an image all at once in one
[00:00:45] go and take in lots of information all
[00:00:47] in one go and that is a very underrated
[00:00:49] part of of learning


=== Are daily affirmations too trendy? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqsoxjc_mfM

[00:00:00] daily affirmations uh
[00:00:02] uh daily affirmations it's quite a trend
[00:00:05] these days it's quite trendy these days
[00:00:07] so for that reason I'd say it's I'm
[00:00:09] gonna say it's properly rated I think I
[00:00:11] think it was underrated and I think it's
[00:00:13] right now it's properly rated because
[00:00:14] it's it's becoming more popular and
[00:00:15] people are starting to understand that
[00:00:16] it's great for positive reinforcement
[00:00:18] and building that positive psychology
[00:00:21] um and helping to sort of break out of
[00:00:23] learn helplessness behaviors maybe if
[00:00:25] you asked me a year from now I might say
[00:00:27] it's overrated because there are
[00:00:28] branches of daily affirmation to sign a
[00:00:30] branch out into this kind of like
[00:00:31] mystical hippie like woo like I'm gonna
[00:00:33] do my daily affirmation as I I look and
[00:00:36] rub into my magical crystal ball and
[00:00:37] like rub salt all over my hair like it's
[00:00:39] starting to Branch into this weird
[00:00:41] territory that's a little off so
[00:00:43] especially on Tick Tock it's it's very
[00:00:46] like you know kills my faith in humanity
[00:00:48] so uh at the moment I'm gonna say
[00:00:50] properly rated but maybe in the future
[00:00:52] it's going to become overrated


=== What type of daily reflection is useful? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFDlJDzFnpE

[00:00:00] is Daily Reflection overrated underrated
[00:00:02] Daily Reflection I think is underrated
[00:00:05] because not many people do it just to
[00:00:08] note that just because you are doing
[00:00:09] Daily Reflection doesn't mean that
[00:00:10] you're getting on the value of daily
[00:00:12] reflection and in some cases Daily
[00:00:13] Reflection can actually make things
[00:00:14] worse especially if you're using that as
[00:00:16] like a a trigger point for negative
[00:00:18] spiraling so I think proper reflective
[00:00:21] technique is super super super
[00:00:22] underrated and if you have proper
[00:00:24] reflective technique and daily
[00:00:26] journaling I think that can be a very
[00:00:27] powerful combination


=== The enemy of a great life is a good life ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg4qOG9iw7c

[00:00:00] there's this thing called the region
[00:00:01] beta Paradox where if things are like
[00:00:03] kind of bad but not like terribly bad
[00:00:05] it's actually the worst place to be
[00:00:07] because it's not good but it's also not
[00:00:09] so bad that you're not like changing
[00:00:11] things I don't know maybe maybe the
[00:00:13] despair you feel now makes you feel so
[00:00:16] much worse that it catalyzes you to make
[00:00:18] a change I don't know maybe
[00:00:20] um burnout though is a really tricky
[00:00:21] thing though it's a really tricky thing


=== How CEOs Need to Learn ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF9rwQxsD1w

[00:00:00] what I wanted to do today in the session
[00:00:01] was very interactive my objective is to
[00:00:04] optimize whatever learning processes
[00:00:07] that any of you have based on your needs
[00:00:10] and it's a fully transferable skill so
[00:00:12] even if you're learning different things
[00:00:13] or learning it in a different setting at
[00:00:15] the end of the day all of that external
[00:00:17] stuff is going to come into your brain
[00:00:18] it's just going to be data in and as
[00:00:20] soon as data comes into your brain
[00:00:22] everything homogenizes it's basically
[00:00:23] the same stuff that happens and so the
[00:00:26] structure that I want to take is first
[00:00:27] of all identifying what type of learning
[00:00:29] scenarios and needs do you have and then
[00:00:32] mapping that against what would you love
[00:00:34] learning to be like so for example maybe
[00:00:36] you don't say you've got a problem with
[00:00:38] learning per se but maybe you would love
[00:00:40] if you could learn like this and then
[00:00:43] what we'll do is map out the existing
[00:00:45] sort of process that you're using and
[00:00:46] we've got limited time so in that time
[00:00:48] I'll just focus in on what I would think
[00:00:50] would be the highest impact thing that
[00:00:52] you could make a change in that would
[00:00:53] immediately improve your efficiency of
[00:00:55] learning and just a little bit of the
[00:00:57] theory around it so that when you leave
[00:00:59] here you've got some first principles to
[00:01:01] fall back on and start being the
[00:01:03] mechanic of your own brain I think a lot
[00:01:05] of the time when we're learning if
[00:01:07] there's a problem with the learning we
[00:01:09] have an overall way of tackling it per
[00:01:11] se because it's not very clear what part
[00:01:14] of it is producing the result there's so
[00:01:16] many things going on in the learning
[00:01:17] process all we have is this binary idea
[00:01:19] that sometimes it kind of works well and
[00:01:21] sometimes it doesn't work as well and
[00:01:22] then we can often have these ideas like
[00:01:24] I'm just not good at this type of
[00:01:25] thinking I'm just not good at this type
[00:01:27] of topical subject or you know I just
[00:01:29] struggle to think about that I can never
[00:01:30] remember this type of thing but actually
[00:01:32] those assumptions are most likely just a
[00:01:34] symptom of a method that was not
[00:01:35] correctly optimized and so the idea is
[00:01:37] not let's take you from
[00:01:39] like being absolutely terrible to being
[00:01:42] decent it's going from being already
[00:01:44] pretty decent to absolutely weaponizing
[00:01:46] what works for you and just eliminating
[00:01:48] every fraction of something that does
[00:01:49] not work and just removing friction so
[00:01:52] would you just underlying question here
[00:01:54] do you think that it's about optimizing
[00:01:55] for each person each person's got a
[00:01:57] different learning style or is there an
[00:01:58] ideal path the way that I like to
[00:02:00] explain this is with the example of a
[00:02:02] banana a banana is like I don't know
[00:02:04] like 50 genetically identical to like a
[00:02:06] human being all human beings have a
[00:02:08] brain that is 99.9999 pretty much the
[00:02:12] same the individual variation happens in
[00:02:14] the very very small fraction so there is
[00:02:16] individual variation that is important
[00:02:18] and optimizing that is important as well
[00:02:20] but in the overwhelming majority of
[00:02:23] cases the biggest high yield thing that
[00:02:25] can be improved is actually something
[00:02:27] that's fundamental that is basically the
[00:02:29] same for all people once the
[00:02:31] fundamentals are done then we start
[00:02:32] fine-tuning and that's where it gets a
[00:02:34] little bit more complex and a lot of
[00:02:35] that individualization the idea of
[00:02:37] people having different learning styles
[00:02:39] as not really something that is we're
[00:02:40] not really considered that scientific
[00:02:42] anymore it's been sort of disproven for
[00:02:44] for the last few decades but there is
[00:02:45] definitely learning preferences and that
[00:02:47] you know people tend to like learning in
[00:02:48] a certain way but those learning
[00:02:50] preferences are usually formed from
[00:02:51] prior experiences and what they feel
[00:02:53] comfortable and competent with but
[00:02:54] research is also quite strong in saying
[00:02:56] that if you develop competencies with
[00:02:57] other learning styles so your
[00:02:59] preferences are of a wider range
[00:03:03] yeah yeah so it basically just equips
[00:03:05] you with more weapons so for example a
[00:03:06] common thing would be I mean how many of
[00:03:08] you listened to like an audible or
[00:03:09] something or like a lot of people really
[00:03:10] struggle with what they do with that new
[00:03:13] information that comes in because a lot
[00:03:14] of that information they're thinking
[00:03:15] about and think oh this is very useful
[00:03:16] and then it's like well I'm driving like
[00:03:18] I can't like do I pull over or do I like
[00:03:19] quickly like draw something else I just
[00:03:21] try to like hold on to that or sometimes
[00:03:22] you can feel like oh I don't need to
[00:03:24] write this down like I'm going to
[00:03:25] remember this it's just you know it just
[00:03:26] clicks right and it just stays there but
[00:03:28] sometimes you think there's a chance
[00:03:30] that by the time I finish this this
[00:03:31] drive that particular point I just don't
[00:03:34] have it locked in at that level that I
[00:03:35] wanted to or sometimes especially how
[00:03:37] many of you read like multiple things
[00:03:39] simultaneously it's not just like
[00:03:40] necessarily one audiobook but it's like
[00:03:42] an audiobook and maybe got a book about
[00:03:43] that topic on the side or an article
[00:03:45] that you read that's you know related to
[00:03:46] that topic yeah it's pretty common I
[00:03:48] think so when we're doing that type of
[00:03:49] information consumption a very common
[00:03:51] thought is oh that like reminds me of
[00:03:53] this thing that I've read in this other
[00:03:54] book and it's like it's obviously
[00:03:56] related together and there's this kind
[00:03:57] of comparison but without the skill to
[00:04:00] take that and then fully consolidate
[00:04:02] that into your knowledge knowledge
[00:04:03] there's a lot of kind of efficiency
[00:04:04] that's lost there so the way that I like
[00:04:07] to say it is if you imagine that
[00:04:09] everything that you learned that you
[00:04:11] thought I should hold on to this you
[00:04:12] could just hold on to it and then what
[00:04:14] you held on to was at the level where it
[00:04:16] is fully integrated and connected so
[00:04:17] you're able to use that information
[00:04:18] fluidly and omnidirectionally not just
[00:04:21] like I hold on to it because I thought
[00:04:23] about it every 20 seconds for this drive
[00:04:24] that is sort of the ideal situation it's
[00:04:27] not necessarily always possible to get
[00:04:28] to that ideal situation but you can get
[00:04:30] pretty close does that answer your
[00:04:31] question in a very long way yeah
[00:04:34] yeah Okay cool so let's just start off
[00:04:36] with um identifying some of the learning
[00:04:37] tasks that you tend to engage in so it
[00:04:39] can really be anything it doesn't have
[00:04:40] to be like the biggest most important
[00:04:42] one but just something that's relevant
[00:04:43] for your life what are the things that
[00:04:44] you'd like to learn what are the things
[00:04:45] that you want to learn the learning
[00:04:47] challenges potentially if you know that
[00:04:49] there are barriers or things and just
[00:04:50] note a few of them down what about the
[00:04:52] other way around what
[00:04:58] how to teach better okay to apply
[00:05:01] um some of these methodologies uh to my
[00:05:04] students okay there is a overlap this
[00:05:06] shared ground and that if you really
[00:05:08] understand how knowledge works and how
[00:05:09] it interacts in the brain that
[00:05:11] fundamentally changes how you think you
[00:05:12] should present it I will talk about a
[00:05:15] few principles with regards to how you
[00:05:17] communicate information that is more
[00:05:19] likely to cognitively optimize it in
[00:05:22] someone else's brain without them doing
[00:05:24] the work so even if they are not
[00:05:26] optimized in their ability to take
[00:05:27] information in there are ways that you
[00:05:29] could present it that force them to
[00:05:31] think about it in a certain way that
[00:05:32] would sort of hijacked their own
[00:05:33] Pathways I'll talk about that a little
[00:05:34] bit it's a very deep topic though so I'm
[00:05:36] not going to cover it in depth but I'll
[00:05:37] definitely touch on it so the next part
[00:05:39] would be to start mapping out what the
[00:05:42] learning process kind of looks like so
[00:05:44] we're really diving into something that
[00:05:45] we call metacognition right now which is
[00:05:47] the thinking about thinking just like if
[00:05:49] you're sort of driving a car and the
[00:05:50] analogy that I give is that if I'm
[00:05:52] driving along and then I'm driving and I
[00:05:54] just think like something about the
[00:05:55] engine just does not sound right like it
[00:05:57] doesn't you know something doesn't it
[00:05:58] feels little bit off and I'm listening
[00:06:00] to it I'm thinking that's not how it
[00:06:02] should be is rattling a little bit
[00:06:03] there's a little bit of like I'm feeling
[00:06:04] a bit more vibration at the wheel I'm
[00:06:06] going to pull over I'm going to open up
[00:06:07] the hood I'm going to look inside and
[00:06:08] I'm going to think I actually don't know
[00:06:09] anything about cost so I'm just going to
[00:06:11] close the lid I'm going to ignore that
[00:06:12] and I'm just going to say this is just
[00:06:13] how my car drives now and I'll take it
[00:06:15] to a mechanic but if that mechanic is
[00:06:17] hard to come by then it's just you drive
[00:06:20] a car that rattles now and that just
[00:06:22] becomes how it is so becoming the
[00:06:24] mechanic of your own learning is
[00:06:25] something I think is very very important
[00:06:26] when you open the hood you know what
[00:06:28] you're looking at so let's start mapping
[00:06:30] out what the learning process is and try
[00:06:32] to be specific so we take it in terms of
[00:06:34] this
[00:06:35] information comes in
[00:06:38] okay that's going to interact with your
[00:06:39] brain
[00:06:43] and then as inside the brain things are
[00:06:45] going to happen
[00:06:47] and I want you to try to be specific
[00:06:49] about what is happening in your brain so
[00:06:51] it could be things that you are
[00:06:52] observing you notice you tend to think
[00:06:54] about certain things or it could be
[00:06:56] things that you are actively consciously
[00:06:58] trying to do when information comes in
[00:07:00] it'll be a combination of both and then
[00:07:02] information is going to be outputted and
[00:07:05] this is the term we use for this is that
[00:07:07] that information is going to be
[00:07:08] retrieved and we also want to think
[00:07:10] about the types of retrieval when I do
[00:07:12] this talk and I talk to students they
[00:07:14] have a lot of what we call lower order
[00:07:16] retrieval requirements which is just
[00:07:18] what is the definition what does the
[00:07:20] terminology mean all this sort of stuff
[00:07:21] for most of us in this room that level
[00:07:24] of retrieval is almost completely
[00:07:25] obsolete in our lives now you either
[00:07:27] just look it up or someone else's job to
[00:07:29] know what that means right and it's just
[00:07:31] not a good investment of time and that's
[00:07:32] not the learning that we really struggle
[00:07:34] with so when we're thinking about
[00:07:35] retrieval what we're also looking at is
[00:07:37] the order of retrieval and specifically
[00:07:39] we're looking at higher order of
[00:07:42] retrieval so a higher order of retrieval
[00:07:44] would mean that you're retrieving the
[00:07:46] information primarily this is the
[00:07:48] Hallmark of higher order retrieval is
[00:07:49] that that information is almost never
[00:07:50] retrieved in isolation that information
[00:07:52] is usually paired with something else
[00:07:53] there's a comparison there is a
[00:07:55] application there's a context so if you
[00:07:57] think about the way that you tend to use
[00:07:58] information that you learn the question
[00:08:00] that I'll put out is do you feel that
[00:08:02] the majority of that retrieval happens
[00:08:04] in a way that that information is never
[00:08:06] retrieved in isolation
[00:08:08] right we would agree with that there may
[00:08:10] be the odd exception to that would be
[00:08:12] what we call mid-order so what mid-order
[00:08:14] retrieval would be is the application of
[00:08:17] a singular isolated piece of information
[00:08:18] for a very specific circumstance so that
[00:08:21] is also what we would be considering as
[00:08:23] isolated information retrieval so that
[00:08:25] would be for example if there's a very
[00:08:26] very specific problem that you have to
[00:08:28] sow so you learn a very specific thing
[00:08:30] about that problem directly and then the
[00:08:32] way you retrieve it is purely within
[00:08:34] that context so that's the odd exception
[00:08:35] to it but again it's you know fairly
[00:08:37] rare so it's like higher order is going
[00:08:38] to be more like pattern recognition this
[00:08:39] is similar to this other thing whereas
[00:08:41] the mid order is very specific it's like
[00:08:43] no I've seen this exact thing before I
[00:08:45] like that you bring up pattern
[00:08:46] recognition because when we say
[00:08:47] something is a pattern in order for us
[00:08:49] to recognize that something as a pattern
[00:08:51] we need to be able to see how it sort of
[00:08:54] the structure that it creates it has to
[00:08:55] have that familiarity so pattern
[00:08:58] recognition is kind of a different thing
[00:08:59] because you can have pattern recognition
[00:09:00] for an isolated thing you can have
[00:09:02] pattern recognition for a broader thing
[00:09:04] what is going to determine whether it's
[00:09:07] pattern recognition or not is how
[00:09:08] familiar yeah it is to you so you can be
[00:09:11] isolated for something that's totally
[00:09:12] new or something that's familiar and you
[00:09:14] can be Broad and multi-connected and
[00:09:16] integrative in the thinking for
[00:09:17] something that is new or familiar
[00:09:18] pattern recognition is more of like a
[00:09:20] efficiency like time saving tendency of
[00:09:22] the brain it just uses less energy yeah
[00:09:25] yeah yeah yeah exactly it's a heuristic
[00:09:26] it's what we often call as system one
[00:09:28] thinking okay so let's use this and
[00:09:30] let's just try to map out what what are
[00:09:31] we doing at each of these processes and
[00:09:33] we want to be meta-cognitive about this
[00:09:34] in terms of what are the thoughts that
[00:09:36] are going on ahead so when information
[00:09:37] is coming in what are we doing with that
[00:09:40] information in a variety of contexts and
[00:09:42] be as specific as to when a new thought
[00:09:44] or A New Concept enters your brain for
[00:09:46] the first time for example like right
[00:09:48] now what is the thought process that is
[00:09:51] going on immediately start from the
[00:09:53] earliest possible moment that you have
[00:09:55] awareness of that thought so the first
[00:09:56] thing I do whenever information comes in
[00:09:58] is I do a two-part filtering process the
[00:10:00] first one is like is this important the
[00:10:02] second one is how can I simplify this
[00:10:04] and distill it down to the only part
[00:10:05] that I'm going to need okay good I'm
[00:10:07] going to build off of that in a second
[00:10:08] let's look at a few more ideas my first
[00:10:10] step is
[00:10:11] a little bit before that actually maybe
[00:10:13] a lot before that is just asking myself
[00:10:16] do I comprehend this information like is
[00:10:19] this something I fully understand I ask
[00:10:21] myself some questions like how does this
[00:10:24] actually apply to my life or a situation
[00:10:27] that I can refer to and then that
[00:10:30] confirms my comprehension of it that's
[00:10:31] good so that's actually the same
[00:10:33] underlying cognitive process that's
[00:10:35] happening with just different symptoms
[00:10:36] and that's actually I'm glad that these
[00:10:38] are the first two things that we heard
[00:10:39] because that's one of the most important
[00:10:41] things that we have to understand about
[00:10:42] learning to start really hacking it yeah
[00:10:43] so I'm going to build on that as well
[00:10:45] also just think about after you've
[00:10:46] learned something for the first time
[00:10:47] what are you doing with that information
[00:10:48] and what's the time delay between that
[00:10:51] activity like are you using it multiple
[00:10:52] times in a short period of time was
[00:10:54] there a long delay or does it vary it
[00:10:56] probably varies but in what situations
[00:10:58] would it vary if you've never thought
[00:11:00] about this before
[00:11:01] then that probably just means that you
[00:11:02] are a normal human being that lives in
[00:11:04] the society and you know that's really a
[00:11:06] societal issue that um we're here to
[00:11:08] solve
[00:11:09] yeah so I mean as soon as I've done my
[00:11:10] filtering processes
[00:11:12] um I take notes and then I go on at the
[00:11:16] earliest opportunity I go seek an
[00:11:17] opportunity to use the information
[00:11:19] um whether that's in a basic way that's
[00:11:21] going to be ultimately useless for me
[00:11:22] it's for the pure purpose of making it
[00:11:24] sink here okay so you will engage in
[00:11:26] activities that are functionally useless
[00:11:28] purely for the purpose of helping to
[00:11:31] consolidate knowledge correct okay yeah
[00:11:33] all right and you do that all of the
[00:11:34] time uh so this is in the context of my
[00:11:37] most common way of learning which is
[00:11:39] video courses or YouTube videos or
[00:11:41] normally learning via video or audio yep
[00:11:44] okay I think there's probably a step in
[00:11:46] between though between for example you
[00:11:48] said you take some notes on it yeah so
[00:11:50] I'd take like I get an Evernote and I
[00:11:52] actually but if I'm doing what say I'm
[00:11:54] doing a course that's got six modules
[00:11:55] each module I'll actually stop after
[00:11:57] that module and I'll go and try and
[00:11:58] Implement yeah so when we say take notes
[00:12:00] I want you to imagine that I'm just like
[00:12:02] a robot you need to program me to take
[00:12:04] these notes okay so I take screenshots
[00:12:06] of what really matters okay uh the most
[00:12:08] important thing is
[00:12:10] uh because I run my butt like yeah
[00:12:13] what's important yeah and then how do I
[00:12:15] how if I was to simplify this and
[00:12:16] distill it down so the only part I'm
[00:12:17] going to need the it's also what parts
[00:12:19] am I going to need to remember from
[00:12:21] there the screenshot is going to do a
[00:12:22] better job of illustrating that to me
[00:12:25] um than written notes if I can get Bible
[00:12:27] written notes and short bullet points
[00:12:29] then I'll do that that's how I'd
[00:12:30] normally technology right so you're
[00:12:31] aiming for that conciseness and and
[00:12:33] making sure that what you've got is like
[00:12:35] the minimal amount that serves the
[00:12:36] purpose of understanding the important
[00:12:38] information correct yeah okay good yep
[00:12:40] because it's only quite long form the
[00:12:42] information I'm taking in it's not still
[00:12:44] down in any way I've really got to wait
[00:12:46] for it correct correct yeah and in fact
[00:12:47] there's even research saying that the
[00:12:48] higher the word count of your notes the
[00:12:50] lower your performance is likely to be
[00:12:52] make sense yeah yeah because it likely
[00:12:54] means that the information was processed
[00:12:56] to a lower level yeah
[00:12:58] okay and that's probably a very similar
[00:13:00] process with different flavors around
[00:13:02] this room most people will probably do a
[00:13:04] similar sort of process of taking notes
[00:13:06] in a similar sort of way maybe the
[00:13:07] software is different and maybe the
[00:13:08] timing is a little bit different does
[00:13:09] anyone have a vastly different approach
[00:13:11] to processing and potentially
[00:13:13] documenting it I'm gonna explain that
[00:13:15] but also you'll see where my problem is
[00:13:17] right so I've come from a background
[00:13:19] where my business is about putting the
[00:13:21] director of operations into businesses
[00:13:23] and so a lot of what we do is very
[00:13:25] process Centric and so my challenge is
[00:13:28] now I'm I'm now in uh doing sales and
[00:13:31] marketing for my business and this is a
[00:13:33] foreign concept and someone has not come
[00:13:34] from this background right so my
[00:13:36] challenge which will relate to my
[00:13:38] learning technique is now I'm doing
[00:13:41] podcasting now I'm doing video marketing
[00:13:43] and trying to
[00:13:45] I will have had some scripts of bullet
[00:13:48] points and then I'm going to have to
[00:13:49] play that back in front of the camera so
[00:13:51] the way I tend to learn that is yeah
[00:13:53] make it shorter form to put key bullet
[00:13:56] points and then I uh do I guess a crude
[00:14:00] version of what you might have heard of
[00:14:01] as Roman room technique but I'll
[00:14:03] associate that with images or something
[00:14:05] to really make it high level yeah but
[00:14:07] even so that's still not many people not
[00:14:09] many people call it that that's the old
[00:14:11] name for that technique
[00:14:15] yeah people normally call it Memory
[00:14:17] Palace or method of loci now yeah that's
[00:14:19] the common term for it yeah I have not
[00:14:21] heard that term used in 15 years I think
[00:14:23] yeah
[00:14:26] so my problem is just recall really it's
[00:14:28] just simple recall of something I'm
[00:14:31] gonna be saying in front of a camera and
[00:14:34] I still use imagery to relate that sort
[00:14:37] of still link it to an application but
[00:14:40] um
[00:14:42] can I just ask you very quickly is that
[00:14:45] when you use that kind of method do you
[00:14:49] feel
[00:14:50] that that is a sort of a limited process
[00:14:53] like do you feel that that is quite a
[00:14:54] like a
[00:14:56] um a cumbersome process and you're just
[00:14:58] subjectively yeah I mean it's cumbersome
[00:15:00] and it takes effort to put it into that
[00:15:02] format for me to be able to play that
[00:15:04] back it works right if I could find a
[00:15:06] less common method of that that works
[00:15:09] yeah okay yeah let's dive into some of
[00:15:13] the like some very very very just basic
[00:15:15] theory around learning because we're
[00:15:17] going to see how all of these things are
[00:15:18] kind of similar at a first principle
[00:15:20] level why some things work and
[00:15:21] something's done and you can really take
[00:15:23] any way that someone learns and you can
[00:15:25] just adopt it and make it work better by
[00:15:27] doing this so what we're talking about
[00:15:29] is the idea of like cognitive
[00:15:30] architecture that's a term that we use
[00:15:32] for a cognitive architecture it
[00:15:33] basically means that it's a school of
[00:15:35] thought that just says that your brain
[00:15:37] is structured in a way and like your
[00:15:39] memory and your thoughts and your
[00:15:40] beliefs and self-conceptions and all
[00:15:41] these other things that make up your
[00:15:42] what you consider as your mind it's made
[00:15:44] up of like a network of ideas that are
[00:15:47] connected to each other and some of
[00:15:48] those connections are more important and
[00:15:50] some of them are less important and some
[00:15:52] nodes have more connections and some
[00:15:53] have less and this side there allows us
[00:15:56] to form these schemas of knowledge these
[00:15:59] sort of models of thinking so this is
[00:16:00] what allows you to have a how to think
[00:16:02] about something rather than the what to
[00:16:04] think about it colloquially when you're
[00:16:06] able to see how it connects together in
[00:16:09] such a a way that it starts to make
[00:16:11] sense and when you form the schema we
[00:16:13] colloquially call that a light bulb
[00:16:14] moment you haven't learned anything new
[00:16:16] you've learned the same thing but you're
[00:16:18] not able to see it in a way that you
[00:16:19] previously were not able to see it the
[00:16:20] time it takes to form a good mental
[00:16:24] model in a schema is one of the biggest
[00:16:26] delays where a lot of the time
[00:16:28] efficiency is actually lost there's a
[00:16:30] lot of learning and thinking and there's
[00:16:32] a lot of effort and load placed on our
[00:16:34] mind in order to try to figure out what
[00:16:35] that schema is and that's that period of
[00:16:37] learning where you're feeling kind of
[00:16:38] confused and you don't really know
[00:16:39] what's going on you know there's
[00:16:40] something going on but you haven't
[00:16:41] really quite figured it out yet and
[00:16:43] sometimes that process is extended like
[00:16:45] months you could be learning about
[00:16:47] something and you know you're on the
[00:16:48] brink of something but you haven't quite
[00:16:50] locked it in yet so what we want to do
[00:16:52] is we want to expedite that so how do we
[00:16:54] expedite the formation of a mental model
[00:16:56] so there's a couple ingredients that we
[00:16:58] need here number one we need the
[00:17:00] information that we're learning for it
[00:17:02] to be felt as being relevant and it
[00:17:04] seems like the most obvious thing when
[00:17:06] we say something is relevant we're
[00:17:08] actually talking about something having
[00:17:11] connections with our existing cognitive
[00:17:13] architecture that's what we assign
[00:17:15] relevance by my favorite example for
[00:17:17] this is can you tell me the third letter
[00:17:20] of the first license plate you saw today
[00:17:23] right that data came in to your brain
[00:17:27] the same as any other data that comes
[00:17:28] into your brain but your brain is
[00:17:30] eliminating that information from your
[00:17:31] memory at such a rate that you don't
[00:17:33] even realize that it was even entered
[00:17:35] into your brain to begin with
[00:17:37] I can remember
[00:17:46] yeah I'm serious because one's an Uber
[00:17:48] because you know what happened on
[00:17:49] Saturday we got into it
[00:17:51] because it was a white Uber I think he
[00:17:54] was driving for 10 minutes and someone
[00:17:56] canceled so this time when we got the
[00:17:58] movie today I definitely all right so
[00:18:01] that's a great yeah that's the perfect
[00:18:03] example of like the you know the same
[00:18:05] data you know because maybe some of you
[00:18:07] saw that same Uber maybe you saw it
[00:18:09] driving right but you know you wouldn't
[00:18:11] have picked up on that when he said our
[00:18:13] ebh 1025 or whatever it is no one was
[00:18:15] like that's the 50th license plate I saw
[00:18:17] today oh I remember suddenly it doesn't
[00:18:18] happen that way that relevance that
[00:18:20] we're assigning something that is
[00:18:22] actually a controllable process
[00:18:23] relevance doesn't have to be something
[00:18:25] that is inherent to the information
[00:18:27] because relevance is dictated by us
[00:18:29] we're the ones that assign something
[00:18:31] relevant the information in itself is
[00:18:33] just raw data so once we understand how
[00:18:35] we can create relevance forcibly for
[00:18:38] information that magical effects on your
[00:18:40] memory and ability to hold on to it
[00:18:41] which then allows you to manipulate that
[00:18:43] information to form these models so
[00:18:45] that's kind of that first ingredient so
[00:18:47] always remember that your brain is
[00:18:49] pretty efficient at learning as an organ
[00:18:52] in itself it does not compare to how
[00:18:54] efficient it is at forgetting
[00:18:55] information the billions of information
[00:18:57] that enters your brain every second you
[00:18:59] know almost all of it is completely
[00:19:01] disregarded because learning is
[00:19:03] extremely energy consuming we want to
[00:19:05] limit that as much as possible so your
[00:19:07] brain will aggressively get rid of any
[00:19:10] information that it does not deem as
[00:19:11] relevant you know when you're sort of
[00:19:13] learning something and you're thinking
[00:19:14] to yourself I don't really get it like
[00:19:16] I'm not really sure how it fits I feel
[00:19:19] like the only way for me to learn this
[00:19:20] is going to be to like just repeat this
[00:19:21] like a few times maybe it's like a
[00:19:23] speech or a script that you've written
[00:19:24] or something and you're just going over
[00:19:26] it again and you just feel that without
[00:19:28] having that repetition you're just it's
[00:19:30] just gonna slip that is your brain
[00:19:32] saying this is not relevant right that
[00:19:34] is the indicator of your brain saying
[00:19:36] this is not right it does not fit with
[00:19:37] my existing schema of knowledge and you
[00:19:39] what you are doing is that you're trying
[00:19:40] to bypass that through Force Through
[00:19:42] Brute Force the analogy of you know
[00:19:44] those baby toys where you have like the
[00:19:46] square like the cube and then you have
[00:19:47] like the square and then you put it
[00:19:49] through the thing and then that's a
[00:19:50] circle in the circle you know it's like
[00:19:51] taking the square the cube and having
[00:19:53] like the circular hole and you're just
[00:19:55] like smashing it through that hole
[00:19:57] repeatedly until it fits like yes
[00:19:59] eventually it will fit but it will be
[00:20:01] distorted and your hand will be bleeding
[00:20:02] and you've got like wood splinters in
[00:20:04] your eyeballs and you know and it takes
[00:20:06] like an entire hour together then
[00:20:07] everything is destroyed that's what the
[00:20:09] process looks like when you're trying to
[00:20:11] force something through when it doesn't
[00:20:13] feel that's relevant so step number one
[00:20:15] is start tuning into that feeling at any
[00:20:17] point when you feel like it's not
[00:20:19] clicking because I don't really see how
[00:20:20] it fits be aware of that sort of process
[00:20:23] and if you feel that the only way to
[00:20:24] overcome that is through something
[00:20:25] that's repetitive then use that as an
[00:20:28] indicator to flick up to a higher level
[00:20:30] of thinking which I'm going to go over
[00:20:31] shortly how can we create relevance how
[00:20:35] can we force something to become
[00:20:37] relevant so Tony Robbins has a process
[00:20:40] on this um I've been through all his
[00:20:42] stuff it was something that was quite
[00:20:43] helpful one of them was basically before
[00:20:45] I go and learn something
[00:20:47] um tell myself why I'm learning it so
[00:20:49] actually defining clearly the reason I'm
[00:20:52] doing this is because of this reason and
[00:20:54] then I'm going into it and I'm forcing
[00:20:55] the relevance I guess yeah and now I
[00:20:57] know what he was doing yeah that's a
[00:20:58] very good sort of starting technique
[00:21:00] that you can use to just start priming
[00:21:03] your brain to receive information it's
[00:21:04] just kind of you know prepping it we can
[00:21:06] take that in other three levels higher
[00:21:08] yeah so that but that's a good place to
[00:21:10] start with but we can do more than that
[00:21:12] Stakes are the other thing that do it
[00:21:14] for me steaks so yeah that does this
[00:21:18] does this matter in my whole life on
[00:21:20] what level of my life does this matter
[00:21:22] is it about my income is it about
[00:21:23] whatever if I've got to learn something
[00:21:24] but the thing is that not all learning
[00:21:27] that you engage with and necessarily
[00:21:29] have the stakes associated with it and
[00:21:31] it doesn't I make myself go if I don't
[00:21:33] learn this
[00:21:34] I put myself through that scenario and
[00:21:37] then it forces me to learn it yeah I
[00:21:39] mean uh I I think you know if it works
[00:21:41] it's good but um I don't know if that's
[00:21:43] the best sustainable way to you know you
[00:21:46] don't want to think back on your life
[00:21:47] and just feel like man my life was
[00:21:49] torture because I just everything I had
[00:21:51] to learn I had to you know hold myself
[00:21:53] at gunpoint so very easy way that we can
[00:21:55] force relevance to something is to
[00:21:58] actually start with relevance so the
[00:22:01] normal way of approaching information is
[00:22:03] like this information comes in we think
[00:22:05] about the information and then we
[00:22:07] retrieve that information and this
[00:22:09] process in the middle all we're trying
[00:22:10] to do here is think well why is this
[00:22:12] relevant and how is it relevant how can
[00:22:13] it fit and how can it make sense of that
[00:22:14] right so instead of doing that what
[00:22:17] we're going to do is start here
[00:22:19] and we're gonna go out
[00:22:21] and we're going to make that a step
[00:22:23] number one so if you're learning
[00:22:25] something for the first time and you're
[00:22:26] learning it brand new before actually
[00:22:28] going into actually learn about it get a
[00:22:31] big wide scope of everything that you
[00:22:33] know that you're going to learn in the
[00:22:35] span of this so if it's a course you
[00:22:36] know get a course outline or you know
[00:22:38] make a list of all the keywords or all
[00:22:39] the terminologies or anything like that
[00:22:41] if you're reading from let's say that
[00:22:42] you've got a new book that you've read
[00:22:44] get a book summary or flick through the
[00:22:47] book very quickly and just look for
[00:22:48] headings bold words diagrams paragraphs
[00:22:51] that seem like it's talking about a
[00:22:52] certain idea you can do an entire book
[00:22:54] let's say 200 Pages you can do that in
[00:22:55] 20 minutes right all you're doing is
[00:22:57] just making a list of all just the words
[00:22:59] okay what's important here is that that
[00:23:01] list is not ordered any specific way I
[00:23:03] don't want any hierarchy I don't want
[00:23:04] anything boldered I don't want anything
[00:23:06] indented nothing like that in fact it's
[00:23:08] even better to make this list out of
[00:23:10] order of the order that you first did it
[00:23:12] you maybe start the book back to front
[00:23:14] start in the middle move outwards it's
[00:23:15] important that we start with an
[00:23:18] unordered list because it breaks the
[00:23:21] cognitive bias of tending to think about
[00:23:23] it and same way it was presented to us
[00:23:25] but the author of the book I can
[00:23:27] guarantee you was not thinking about you
[00:23:28] when they wrote that book so by Design
[00:23:31] the way the information is presented is
[00:23:33] never really going to be cognitively
[00:23:34] optimized for you and your knowledge
[00:23:36] schema we don't want to run into the
[00:23:38] Trap of understanding it in the way the
[00:23:40] author thought about it because what's
[00:23:42] happening with learning and teaching is
[00:23:44] that we have this fluid you know
[00:23:47] omnidirectional schema of knowledge and
[00:23:49] this is what we know when we think about
[00:23:51] a topic that we're very specialized in
[00:23:52] if you think about that your area of
[00:23:54] specialization and your business you
[00:23:55] know that you have a better knowledge
[00:23:56] about that than most people that you're
[00:23:58] going to meet about that particular
[00:23:59] topic and so that knowledge is not
[00:24:02] something that starts in any particular
[00:24:03] order it's not linear you can start at
[00:24:05] any point and go in any other direction
[00:24:07] very fluidly but in order for you to
[00:24:09] teach someone about that let's say you
[00:24:10] become the author of the book and you
[00:24:12] need to teach someone about this you now
[00:24:13] need to linearize and order this
[00:24:15] information in a way that you think
[00:24:17] makes sense for the reader so if the
[00:24:19] reader takes that information and learns
[00:24:21] it in that format their knowledge is not
[00:24:24] going to be your knowledge because your
[00:24:26] knowledge was distilled and simplified
[00:24:28] and funneled through pen and paper or
[00:24:30] you know through the printing press
[00:24:31] through the limitations of how that
[00:24:33] knowledge could be communicated so what
[00:24:35] the learner's job is to take that and
[00:24:37] then re-package it in a way that most
[00:24:40] closely resembles that Omni directional
[00:24:42] fluid structure right I think we all
[00:24:44] know this kind of intuitively well some
[00:24:46] people don't know this intuitively right
[00:24:47] and they just take it as is when we
[00:24:49] start with learning we've got these you
[00:24:51] know maybe one book or a range of
[00:24:52] resources we're going to take that list
[00:24:54] of keywords and terminology and main
[00:24:56] ideas and we're going to make this list
[00:24:57] and we're going to do it out of order
[00:24:58] with no indentation no boating nothing
[00:25:00] it's just a list of words plain as can
[00:25:02] be and that's going to help us to break
[00:25:04] away from seeing it and the author's
[00:25:06] mode of thinking and then from that
[00:25:08] you're just going to scan through this
[00:25:10] list if there is a word there that you
[00:25:12] look at and you just think I have
[00:25:13] absolutely no idea what it means I look
[00:25:15] at it and I literally do not have any
[00:25:17] idea what it means which is uncommon
[00:25:19] then go and look it up a little bit more
[00:25:21] read about a little bit more read a few
[00:25:23] sentences about it know spend 30 seconds
[00:25:24] to just generally get your head around
[00:25:26] what that word means and this might take
[00:25:28] you another I don't know five ten
[00:25:29] minutes now you're going to take this
[00:25:30] list and you're going to try to create
[00:25:32] that fluid mental model that schema that
[00:25:36] omnidirectional that kind of network of
[00:25:38] thought purely based on what you
[00:25:40] understand about this list of words so
[00:25:42] what we're doing is we're sort of
[00:25:43] skipping the process of trying to
[00:25:44] understand it and you know comprehending
[00:25:47] it fully and all of that sort of stuff
[00:25:48] we're just going to create a hypothesis
[00:25:51] about I think this information will be
[00:25:54] structured in this way and that because
[00:25:56] of the fact that we're working with with
[00:25:58] almost nothing it forces us to rely only
[00:26:01] on our prior existing knowledge step and
[00:26:03] so we'll end up forming this model that
[00:26:05] could be you know 30 of it might need to
[00:26:07] be modified and changed because it was
[00:26:08] inaccurate or something like that but
[00:26:10] we'll form this overarching structure
[00:26:12] about how the knowledge works and then
[00:26:13] at that point we have a schema we have
[00:26:16] that how to think about that mental
[00:26:17] model that normally takes months to
[00:26:19] develop we have a hypothesis about what
[00:26:21] it might look like before we've even
[00:26:23] really started learning about it so that
[00:26:26] model that we've created that was built
[00:26:27] fundamentally off the foundation of our
[00:26:29] prior knowledge everything to do with
[00:26:31] anything in that model is now relevant
[00:26:33] because you generated this model
[00:26:34] everything is testing a hypothesis new
[00:26:37] information comes in oh yeah that fits
[00:26:38] in with how I thought about it
[00:26:40] previously oh it's different to how I
[00:26:41] thought about it differently but like
[00:26:42] how is it different why is it different
[00:26:44] oh and therefore the type of thinking
[00:26:46] that we can have about it is
[00:26:47] automatically at a higher level so
[00:26:49] normally the process would be understand
[00:26:50] what we're learning first you know to a
[00:26:52] decent amount and then as we're going
[00:26:54] through we're processing and building
[00:26:55] models sort of as we go but the problem
[00:26:58] with doing it that way
[00:26:59] is that
[00:27:00] uh information just becomes too
[00:27:02] disorganized too scattered it's kind of
[00:27:04] like a map of a city that has no
[00:27:06] highways you can get from one point to
[00:27:08] another point but the rows that you need
[00:27:10] to take is just you know everywhere so
[00:27:12] you might start with you know saying
[00:27:13] okay here's one point I'm not really
[00:27:15] sure what it means you learn a little
[00:27:16] bit about it and then you have this
[00:27:17] point and then you know you might say
[00:27:19] well are they connected no they're not
[00:27:20] and you learn about this point and these
[00:27:22] three are still not connected and you've
[00:27:23] got this point and by that time you're
[00:27:24] sort of semi-forgetting this point and
[00:27:26] then you think oh this is related to
[00:27:28] this thing and then you're going off and
[00:27:29] you know learning more things and you're
[00:27:30] creating these sorts of so this is
[00:27:33] generally what learning ends up kind of
[00:27:35] looking like is that you form these sort
[00:27:37] of structures as you kind of go and what
[00:27:39] you can hopefully see is that there are
[00:27:42] relationships and connections that are
[00:27:43] forming but it's very hard to see what
[00:27:45] is actually going on right it's there's
[00:27:47] not really even much on there and
[00:27:49] already assigned to become difficulty if
[00:27:51] someone looks at that they're not going
[00:27:52] to get a clear picture of it and so if
[00:27:54] this is the state of organization of
[00:27:55] that knowledge in your mind then that's
[00:27:57] the extent through which you're going to
[00:27:58] be able to retrieve it going from here
[00:27:59] to here is going to be like I know that
[00:28:01] you can kind of do something there but
[00:28:03] then there's this other part that comes
[00:28:04] in and so it's it's very disorganized
[00:28:06] right
[00:28:07] by starting with just the basics we're
[00:28:09] saying that okay we understand that all
[00:28:11] these things are probably related in
[00:28:12] some way and I think it's probably going
[00:28:14] to be something that looks like this
[00:28:17] and we're starting with just a very very
[00:28:19] basic skeleton of it we've got the big
[00:28:21] picture of it the whole scope of it to
[00:28:23] begin with when you learn the first
[00:28:25] piece of information you're already
[00:28:26] thinking about the last piece of
[00:28:27] information how it might relate when you
[00:28:29] normally learn linearly from start to
[00:28:31] finish you're not even aware about what
[00:28:33] you need to be thinking about later on
[00:28:35] to even have the thought to potentially
[00:28:37] connect it so everything becomes kind of
[00:28:39] retrospective whereas now when you learn
[00:28:41] that new information you're thinking
[00:28:42] okay it could fit here here or here well
[00:28:44] I know it's going to be related to this
[00:28:45] thing but I also know it's probably
[00:28:47] going to have a relationship over here
[00:28:48] so now you're thinking I'm not going to
[00:28:51] organize the information you know like
[00:28:52] way out over here because it has to
[00:28:54] connect with the stuff that's over here
[00:28:55] at some point somehow that already
[00:28:58] starts framing the context and the
[00:29:00] relevance and the purpose of the
[00:29:01] information differently this is called
[00:29:03] integrative learning and the idea is
[00:29:05] that we are trying to integrate the
[00:29:07] learning as quickly as possible we're
[00:29:09] creating almost a mold that information
[00:29:11] can sit in as soon as it it's there
[00:29:13] rather than having each individual
[00:29:15] component and then going through it
[00:29:16] retrospectively to try to to figure it
[00:29:18] all out and then cleaning it up and then
[00:29:19] going back to the resource and then
[00:29:20] looking at it again and then fixing this
[00:29:22] we're saying this is probably how it's
[00:29:24] going to be I'll shift a few things
[00:29:25] around as I learn but as I'm taking more
[00:29:27] information in I will just be building
[00:29:29] and consolidating it as a big picture to
[00:29:32] begin with so it's kind of like if
[00:29:33] you're sculpting something out of stone
[00:29:35] you wouldn't take a stone block and then
[00:29:37] you wouldn't you wouldn't scope like a
[00:29:38] perfect nose in like a perfect eyeball
[00:29:40] and then you know work your way through
[00:29:42] that and everything's gonna be out of
[00:29:43] proportion and it's gonna be in the
[00:29:44] wrong place you're going to get the
[00:29:45] general shape of it first and then
[00:29:46] you're going to go in progressively
[00:29:47] further detail if you're painting a wall
[00:29:49] you're going to do that primer layer
[00:29:50] first and then you're going to go over
[00:29:51] it again again we're working out
[00:29:53] knowledge in layers of Mastery rather
[00:29:55] than order of information
[00:29:57] changes right so the big thing about how
[00:30:01] this system is novel is that no one else
[00:30:03] really tells you to flip it because it's
[00:30:05] actually very counter-intuitive it's
[00:30:07] very counter-intuitive to try to achieve
[00:30:09] essentially Mastery over a topic before
[00:30:11] you even understand what the concepts
[00:30:13] individually are but the idea is that no
[00:30:16] matter how you learn it you're going to
[00:30:18] you know have have questions and doubts
[00:30:19] and you're going to reform that schema
[00:30:21] you're forming anyway at some point and
[00:30:23] no matter what you're learning if it's
[00:30:25] not relevant if it does not fit
[00:30:27] somewhere you're cognitively you're
[00:30:28] going to struggle with it so those are
[00:30:30] objective truths so therefore if we can
[00:30:32] increase the relevance and if we can
[00:30:34] make it so that the revisions of our
[00:30:35] knowledge that we're doing are just more
[00:30:37] productive since we're doing them anyway
[00:30:38] then we're able to achieve a level of
[00:30:40] Mastery of learning that's far beyond
[00:30:42] sorry not necessarily Beyond in terms of
[00:30:44] the Mastery but much faster than you
[00:30:46] would normally be able to achieve right
[00:30:48] so if I was I mean I'm an audible
[00:30:50] listener right so if I now wanted to
[00:30:53] apply something like this I might find
[00:30:55] the book summary yes right my list of
[00:30:58] words yes research a bit around what
[00:31:01] those particular topics were yes but
[00:31:03] then go from start to finish no no after
[00:31:06] you do that you then need to create some
[00:31:08] kind of schematic and you can put this
[00:31:09] in you know this kind of format you
[00:31:11] could have a you know a paper where you
[00:31:12] jot it down you could I personally
[00:31:13] really encourage you know people so
[00:31:16] normally when we think about note taking
[00:31:17] we're thinking like learning at school
[00:31:19] or like you know sitting in lectures or
[00:31:20] something but the ideal way of using
[00:31:23] note taking is to cognitively accelerate
[00:31:25] your learning if you do note taking
[00:31:27] correctly what what it does is it
[00:31:28] offloads unnecessary cognitive resources
[00:31:31] instead of having to hold on to all of
[00:31:33] it you're just speeding up the process
[00:31:35] of it so you would map it out on
[00:31:37] something so I personally use an
[00:31:38] infinite canvas app on a tablet because
[00:31:40] it allows my knowledge to grow
[00:31:41] organically in in all directions I'm not
[00:31:43] restricted by Page size which personally
[00:31:45] I believe is the stupidest possible
[00:31:46] reason for knowledge to be restricted is
[00:31:48] because of page size
[00:31:50] you know what if we were just born into
[00:31:51] a world that A1 is the norm you know
[00:31:53] like what everyone will be a genius
[00:31:55] um so in this example here you would
[00:31:58] reorder the table
[00:32:00] TS okay
[00:32:01] uh the answer will be yes but it's very
[00:32:03] important that you're trying not to see
[00:32:05] it in terms of a table of contents to
[00:32:06] begin with because even the idea of
[00:32:08] seeing it in terms of table of contents
[00:32:10] will influence the way you're likely to
[00:32:12] structure it so if you shuffled it if
[00:32:14] you just make a list Shuffle it yeah
[00:32:16] there's a little random shelf load and
[00:32:18] then you try to create a schemer and try
[00:32:19] to draw out how you think that's going
[00:32:20] to link together that that would be a
[00:32:22] great starting point yes that would be a
[00:32:23] great starting point and the important
[00:32:24] part here is that there's two things
[00:32:26] that you should try to follow number one
[00:32:27] try to do it relatively clean try to
[00:32:30] make it relatively simple to follow like
[00:32:32] we're working big picture you don't need
[00:32:33] to have every single keyword planted on
[00:32:35] here but you should have what you think
[00:32:37] are like you know basically all of the
[00:32:38] main and important ones because you
[00:32:40] might look at one thing and know already
[00:32:41] that is just simply one example of this
[00:32:45] other concept it's not going to be
[00:32:46] important in itself you don't need to
[00:32:48] have that one on your overall starting
[00:32:49] structure but the main concept that it's
[00:32:51] tied to that should be integrated
[00:32:52] somehow so try to make it as simple as
[00:32:55] possible and then number two follow what
[00:32:57] I call the 2-4 rule which is that
[00:32:59] information should be grouped together
[00:33:01] you do not want 100 pieces of
[00:33:02] information with just like 100 you know
[00:33:03] 700 arrows everywhere this can be
[00:33:06] grouped together this can be grouped
[00:33:07] together this can be grouped together
[00:33:08] this can be grouped together the reason
[00:33:09] we do it out of order is because the
[00:33:11] order you group it and needs to make
[00:33:12] sense for you which is not necessarily
[00:33:14] the way that it's presented to you in
[00:33:15] fact in my experience around 60 to 70 of
[00:33:17] all the groups you will form for
[00:33:18] knowledge across any domain end up being
[00:33:20] different how it is initially presented
[00:33:22] to you you know you're going to look at
[00:33:23] all this information and think well how
[00:33:24] can I group this in a way that makes
[00:33:25] sense and therefore you're going to do a
[00:33:27] lot of this back and forth thinking a
[00:33:29] lot of this kind of comparing and
[00:33:30] contrasting and I want you to notice
[00:33:32] even at this very early stage before
[00:33:34] you've even really looked at it linearly
[00:33:36] before you've started consuming
[00:33:37] information already you are engaging in
[00:33:39] the type of back and forth thinking that
[00:33:42] you know you are going to need to start
[00:33:43] doing when you actually retrieve it at a
[00:33:45] high level that's how you think about
[00:33:47] stuff that you are good at knowledge
[00:33:49] that you're confident and that's the
[00:33:50] type of thinking you do so we're
[00:33:51] engaging in that type of thinking before
[00:33:52] we even know what it is we're really
[00:33:54] thinking about and this is a this is a
[00:33:56] big cognitive hack you know it allows
[00:33:58] you to retain information much more
[00:34:00] easily and it allows you to build that
[00:34:01] Mastery more quickly and what do you
[00:34:03] call playback and what you call it you
[00:34:04] call that like a schema for this yeah so
[00:34:07] there's different ways that you can call
[00:34:09] it you know some people call it models
[00:34:10] some people call it schemas there's
[00:34:12] different terminologies that I use in
[00:34:13] the program that I run that associate
[00:34:15] more things with it it doesn't really
[00:34:16] matter what the label you associate with
[00:34:18] it is but so it really comes down to
[00:34:20] that pre-work I've got my list I'm now
[00:34:22] trying to create an order I'm going to
[00:34:25] say order but create some rationality
[00:34:27] structure of how it links together yes
[00:34:30] so that it's that more simple flow
[00:34:32] through but then as you do eventually
[00:34:34] then
[00:34:35] I'm assuming you could then do take in
[00:34:37] the book in normal format yeah well
[00:34:40] actually what you'll find is that once
[00:34:41] you do that you may not even want to
[00:34:42] take it into the normal format because
[00:34:44] you may find that already through the
[00:34:46] just the pure process of doing this you
[00:34:48] are already achieving a level of
[00:34:50] knowledge on the estate is
[00:34:52] seems impossible where you feel more
[00:34:54] confident about this topic than you
[00:34:56] really should be given that you don't
[00:34:57] really know anything about it but you
[00:34:59] already sort of see how it can you know
[00:35:01] come together and you are assigning more
[00:35:03] and more relevant to certain parts and
[00:35:04] you're starting to apply the knowledge
[00:35:05] before you even know what it is you're
[00:35:07] applying so you may think I actually
[00:35:08] want to start here right so you could
[00:35:10] just start there if you wanted to in
[00:35:12] fact a lot of the times what I'll do is
[00:35:13] I'll have like you know two or three or
[00:35:15] three or four books that I'm looking
[00:35:16] through and I'll make this as a keyword
[00:35:17] and then I'll go through it and then
[00:35:18] I'll just start going into where I want
[00:35:20] to start and I'll just use Google and by
[00:35:22] time I finish I don't actually even need
[00:35:23] the book so what I do with the book is I
[00:35:25] just flick through it to see is there
[00:35:26] anything I missed and there's always
[00:35:27] something that I missed but it means
[00:35:28] that the learning is driven by me I'm in
[00:35:31] control of every single process and I'm
[00:35:33] optimizing everything any information
[00:35:34] that comes in it's because I want it to
[00:35:35] come in it's relevant because I wanted
[00:35:37] it to be there and it serves a purpose
[00:35:39] every time there's no thinking about how
[00:35:41] does it serve a purpose and how can I
[00:35:42] make this relevant it's relevant because
[00:35:44] it was relevant to begin with
[00:35:46] right that makes sense yeah and why is
[00:35:48] it called the 24 rule ah yes so
[00:35:51] um so you were creating these groups you
[00:35:53] you always want each group to have only
[00:35:56] two things in it and a maximum of four
[00:35:58] okay so you'll have groups and then
[00:36:00] subgroups within those groups so if
[00:36:01] you've got like one big thing and then
[00:36:03] underneath that is like 20 other
[00:36:04] Concepts break that into if you can two
[00:36:07] subgroups and a maximum of four this is
[00:36:09] basically the type of schema that you
[00:36:10] might end up forming there's a few
[00:36:12] things I want you to notice with this is
[00:36:14] that number one the information flows in
[00:36:17] multiple directions it doesn't do what I
[00:36:19] call water falling so this would be an
[00:36:20] example of water falling okay let's
[00:36:21] start with a conventional model this is
[00:36:23] what water falling looks like
[00:36:28] right
[00:36:29] you can see why it's called waterfalling
[00:36:31] what's the problem with this knowledge
[00:36:32] does not look like that not not real
[00:36:34] expertise this is exactly what it looks
[00:36:36] like for someone that has really done
[00:36:38] well at trying to learn the way that the
[00:36:40] textbook grouped for them because that's
[00:36:42] fully linear right so this we are
[00:36:45] avoiding this through that reordering
[00:36:46] process and it's very hard to avoid
[00:36:48] doing this without taking a deliberate
[00:36:50] step to break that because it's a
[00:36:52] cognitive bias that operates on
[00:36:53] autopilot before you're able to really
[00:36:55] react to it it's already been reframed a
[00:36:57] little bit so we don't want water
[00:36:59] falling but waterfalling can look like
[00:37:01] this as well
[00:37:04] right it doesn't have to be necessarily
[00:37:06] down the page this also is waterfalling
[00:37:09] right and for most people this is what a
[00:37:11] mind map looks like but this is
[00:37:13] waterfall you can see it's essentially
[00:37:15] just radially coming out but it's the
[00:37:16] same thing so what this is lacking is
[00:37:18] laterality of thinking so if you saw
[00:37:21] information like this
[00:37:23] and then you demonstrate it expressed it
[00:37:25] like this and then now you're saying oh
[00:37:27] I want to add laterality to the
[00:37:28] information then it's going to look like
[00:37:30] this
[00:37:37] okay that's what I'll end up looking
[00:37:39] like and now you can't follow that
[00:37:41] there's too much going on and the reason
[00:37:43] is because laterality which is inherent
[00:37:45] to the knowledge was added
[00:37:46] retrospectively the structure itself is
[00:37:49] fundamentally wrong and we're trying to
[00:37:51] make it work by just adding arrows into
[00:37:52] it the problem is not that we're trying
[00:37:55] to think about that the problem is that
[00:37:56] we're thinking about that after the fact
[00:37:57] this is what happens when you also learn
[00:37:58] linearly is that you have a structure
[00:38:00] but the structure is not something that
[00:38:02] actually makes sense it doesn't operate
[00:38:04] the way true knowledge operates so this
[00:38:06] is what we want to avoid so when you're
[00:38:08] looking at my thing notice that there is
[00:38:10] laterality but the laterality is not
[00:38:12] just going everywhere all over the page
[00:38:14] you know there are no lines that cross
[00:38:16] each other there are no arrows across
[00:38:17] each other everything is there is
[00:38:19] laterality and there's structure and
[00:38:20] then there is a flow and there's a
[00:38:21] Simplicity but it's represented cleanly
[00:38:24] and also there is no group on there that
[00:38:26] has more than four things coming out of
[00:38:27] it at any point I call that a chunk map
[00:38:29] because what you're forming are these
[00:38:30] chunks uh that chunk map obviously it
[00:38:33] looks like there's you know a decent
[00:38:34] amount of information on there so this
[00:38:36] is over 500 pages of information
[00:38:38] distilled on that that's Journal
[00:38:40] articles that's textbook chapters that's
[00:38:42] my whole Masters paper on that I made
[00:38:44] that in one study session and then I was
[00:38:47] invited to be a lecturer for that topic
[00:38:49] before I even finished the paper so the
[00:38:51] Mastery that you're able to get through
[00:38:53] this is it allows you to achieve the
[00:38:55] Mastery that is sort of unnatural to
[00:38:57] achieve it allows you to have a problem
[00:38:59] or a certain field of learning that
[00:39:01] you're interested in and engage in that
[00:39:03] learning and then after a week you're
[00:39:06] talking to people that have been
[00:39:07] studying this for years and they will be
[00:39:08] you're not going to know more than them
[00:39:10] the value you can extract from
[00:39:11] interacting with that expertise that's
[00:39:13] going to be efficient level you're going
[00:39:15] to get more value out of that does
[00:39:16] reckoning surface level of knowledge of
[00:39:18] the entire landscape first and then
[00:39:20] building up the Mastery in different
[00:39:22] areas because they're all interconnected
[00:39:23] as you need yes yeah and you could do it
[00:39:26] linearly if you wanted to if you've done
[00:39:28] these first steps well if you do it
[00:39:30] linearly that's okay as well it's not
[00:39:31] technically as Optimum as it could be
[00:39:33] compared to just going into it as you as
[00:39:35] you want to have done it like this just
[00:39:37] naturally and and I've picked stuff up
[00:39:39] way faster yeah and the times when I've
[00:39:41] tried to go the other way where I've
[00:39:42] tried to master the individual step
[00:39:43] before getting the whole picture like
[00:39:45] when I was learning salsa it was
[00:39:46] terrible
[00:39:48] it was it was one picture I just
[00:39:50] couldn't learn But the teacher was
[00:39:51] trying to get me to master this first
[00:39:52] step and no you're going to get that
[00:39:53] right before we move on yeah I would say
[00:39:56] other people who like the whole picture
[00:39:57] and did it all poorly and put it
[00:39:58] together learn everything a lot faster
[00:40:00] yeah so the difference here is in terms
[00:40:02] of what we call lower or higher like
[00:40:04] orders of learning versus orders of
[00:40:07] thinking so a high order of thing King
[00:40:11] allows you to achieve both high and low
[00:40:14] levels of actual Mastery whereas a low
[00:40:17] order of thinking only allows you to
[00:40:19] achieve a low level and so if you're
[00:40:20] focusing on things in isolation and just
[00:40:22] learning one thing at a time it's true
[00:40:24] you need to know the basics to be able
[00:40:25] to navigate the higher levels that's
[00:40:27] unavoidable fact you cannot talk about a
[00:40:28] concept without knowing what the concept
[00:40:30] is but the method of how you understand
[00:40:32] that concept do you use a lower order
[00:40:34] method of thinking to achieve it or do
[00:40:36] you use a higher order method to achieve
[00:40:37] it higher order means integrated
[00:40:39] therefore it means more relevant so
[00:40:41] you're still learning the same thing but
[00:40:42] now it has context integrated your
[00:40:45] boosting connections to other topics to
[00:40:47] increase its level of relevance correct
[00:40:49] and the important part is that what
[00:40:51] we're boosting is the connections that
[00:40:52] we're forming to prior knowledge we're
[00:40:54] starting with the prior knowledge
[00:40:55] because what you do is you're boosting
[00:40:57] connections purely just connections
[00:40:58] without first starting with a schema
[00:41:01] from what you already know then the
[00:41:02] difficulty with that is that you end up
[00:41:04] falling what I call an island which is a
[00:41:06] well-connected schema of knowledge that
[00:41:07] is actually separate from your main body
[00:41:09] of knowledge so a symptom of that would
[00:41:11] be that you have a good understanding of
[00:41:13] that knowledge but you will still
[00:41:15] struggle to apply that in nuanced ways
[00:41:17] or you will require cueing to be able to
[00:41:19] engage in that type of thinking most
[00:41:21] common way that you may have experienced
[00:41:22] is if you've worked with like very
[00:41:24] intelligent new grads that have a lot of
[00:41:26] knowledge but you really need to cue
[00:41:28] them to start thinking about it once you
[00:41:30] cue them you're like oh yeah and they
[00:41:31] can grow with it but being able to
[00:41:33] themselves apply it is separate because
[00:41:36] their knowledge schema is not actually
[00:41:37] connected with it it kind of reminds me
[00:41:39] of Feynman who used to do the Christmas
[00:41:40] lectures and the Nobel Prize winner yeah
[00:41:42] he was well known to be able to take a
[00:41:44] really complex topic like you know
[00:41:46] nuclear physics and explain that to kids
[00:41:48] because you could very link it to prior
[00:41:51] knowledge yeah so a lot of his work is
[00:41:53] you know a lot of the stuff kind of
[00:41:54] Builds on and extends some of his work
[00:41:56] yeah because the idea here is that if
[00:41:58] you're able to do the very simplified
[00:41:59] big picture schema then that's
[00:42:01] essentially what you need to be able to
[00:42:03] explain something to uh you know like a
[00:42:04] five-year-old because it's not just
[00:42:05] explaining to a five-year-old it's
[00:42:07] explaining comprehensively and
[00:42:08] accurately the main important points and
[00:42:10] the main important rate relationships in
[00:42:12] such a way that it's simple to
[00:42:12] understand right it's not just purely
[00:42:14] explaining something to a five-year-old
[00:42:16] right which you know you can do with
[00:42:17] anything just use simpler terms it's
[00:42:19] about the comprehensiveness and the
[00:42:20] accuracy of it so this level of Mastery
[00:42:23] and building that is what we are aiming
[00:42:25] for the difference is that we're trying
[00:42:26] to build that before we even have a good
[00:42:29] understanding of the topic itself most
[00:42:31] people that are professionals that have
[00:42:33] some real world learning kind of
[00:42:34] experience you already will have many of
[00:42:37] the elements of thinking that we've
[00:42:39] talked about here and a lot of the
[00:42:40] things that you found work for you will
[00:42:42] be using certain elements of this and
[00:42:44] what we're doing is we're just creating
[00:42:45] a full system out well it's not really a
[00:42:47] full system yet but like we're creating
[00:42:48] at least a comprehensive technique out
[00:42:50] of it and what you should feel is that
[00:42:53] sort of restrictions on your learning
[00:42:55] that you previously didn't even know
[00:42:56] where there start being lifted things
[00:42:58] just start becoming easier to understand
[00:43:00] like everything clicks that light bulb
[00:43:03] moment it should just be every concept
[00:43:05] is light bulb moment just constantly
[00:43:07] right to the point where it would be
[00:43:09] unusual for you to learn something and
[00:43:11] not have that light bulb moment at an
[00:43:13] extremely early stage that should become
[00:43:15] the norm and for most people that have
[00:43:16] this sort of learning experience if they
[00:43:17] apply this kind of thinking you'll
[00:43:19] probably be able to achieve something
[00:43:20] like that within just the first few
[00:43:21] attempts of it the very first time you
[00:43:23] do this you'll realize that it's a lot
[00:43:25] more complicated than I've just made it
[00:43:27] out to be because there's just so many
[00:43:28] thoughts going through your head in
[00:43:29] terms of like does it make sense to do
[00:43:30] this am I meant to do it this way like
[00:43:31] can I group it this way but then I could
[00:43:32] group it this way as well and do I form
[00:43:34] this structure or this structure or am I
[00:43:35] meant to read into this or not and all
[00:43:37] those micro decisions and you know that
[00:43:39] there's a much longer discussion but
[00:43:42] you just give it a go and you see how it
[00:43:44] is and then you start optimizing and
[00:43:45] then after a few weeks it starts
[00:43:47] becoming easier and easier and after a
[00:43:49] few months that becomes a normal way
[00:43:50] that you start thinking about things and
[00:43:52] the great thing is that because of
[00:43:53] neuroplasticity the brain's ability to
[00:43:55] mold itself the more you think like this
[00:43:57] the more you're able to to hold on to
[00:43:59] because information is Consolidated much
[00:44:01] more rapidly and therefore you're able
[00:44:03] to learn for more sources simultaneously
[00:44:05] you're able to handle much larger
[00:44:07] volumes of information and you're able
[00:44:09] to ride over a lot of the external
[00:44:11] variability of learning whether you've
[00:44:13] got a good resource or a good teacher or
[00:44:14] whatever it is a lot of those external
[00:44:16] variations will be able to ride over it
[00:44:18] I like the fact that the extreme
[00:44:20] opposite of this is repetition like if
[00:44:22] I've got to urgently learn something I'm
[00:44:25] inclined to go all right I've got a
[00:44:26] couple of lines and I'm going to change
[00:44:27] my shooting angle and I'm going to say
[00:44:28] something else and that's like the enemy
[00:44:30] of this this is exactly yeah so I'm glad
[00:44:34] you've shot that down from the get-go
[00:44:36] let me very quickly touch on the idea of
[00:44:39] when you're teaching someone else
[00:44:41] something so you know you can't just be
[00:44:43] like okay let's start a meeting and
[00:44:45] therefore let me teach you about all of
[00:44:46] this and then go practice it for the
[00:44:48] next few weeks and then we'll come back
[00:44:49] and then I'll teach you some stuff right
[00:44:50] so one of the things that we want to do
[00:44:52] is we want to get them engaged in this
[00:44:54] process so usually most of the people
[00:44:57] here when you're in a meeting you
[00:44:58] actually have some Authority in terms of
[00:44:59] what the other person can actually be
[00:45:00] doing in that meeting how they can be
[00:45:01] thinking about it so one of the ways I
[00:45:03] like to start off if I know that we're
[00:45:05] touching on something that's reasonably
[00:45:07] complex is to get them to create
[00:45:10] a structure in terms of what they think
[00:45:12] what we are talking about today is how
[00:45:13] they Envision it and what the purpose is
[00:45:15] you know almost put them in the position
[00:45:16] of that owner and figure out what that
[00:45:18] big picture is I want you to map it up
[00:45:19] and get them thinking about it from
[00:45:21] their prior knowledge to build their
[00:45:23] schema to begin with and then from there
[00:45:25] we can start asking probing questions
[00:45:27] some good questions that we can start
[00:45:28] with are what part of what you've
[00:45:30] started there do you think is the most
[00:45:32] important one that we need to like nail
[00:45:33] in first or potentially watch
[00:45:35] relationship which process is going to
[00:45:37] be the most important thing and the
[00:45:38] second thing when I say the word Black
[00:45:40] Swan is just put your hand up if you're
[00:45:41] familiar with this term Black Swan
[00:45:43] great so the second question would be
[00:45:46] what are the black swans to your model
[00:45:48] right and that activates again that
[00:45:50] higher level of thinking because
[00:45:51] remember the first principle here all of
[00:45:53] this is activating their brain and that
[00:45:54] level of thinking and learning that is
[00:45:56] more reflective of true expertise rather
[00:45:58] than something that's lower level or
[00:46:00] more passive after they've done that
[00:46:01] process and they've refined that schema
[00:46:03] you'll probably find that the
[00:46:04] conversation that ensues when you just
[00:46:05] go through and start talking about it
[00:46:07] they're able to bring a lot more value
[00:46:09] to the table they're able to engage with
[00:46:11] the content more organically they're
[00:46:12] more curious about things because now
[00:46:13] they have a hypothesis they have
[00:46:15] invested cognitive resources into
[00:46:16] building they want to know why it's
[00:46:17] wrong right and all of you are probably
[00:46:18] doing that while we were talking today
[00:46:20] you were building your own kind of model
[00:46:21] of how it works and that informs the
[00:46:23] types of questions you tend to ask and
[00:46:25] this increases the value of what you
[00:46:27] teach them correct massively because now
[00:46:30] it's the it's the gift that keeps on
[00:46:31] giving you test them this that's the
[00:46:33] starting point a lot of the time what we
[00:46:35] worry about is we taught them something
[00:46:36] and it's will they even remember what I
[00:46:38] just taught them right but what it
[00:46:40] should be is I just taught them this a
[00:46:41] week later they're coming back and now
[00:46:43] they know know even more because there
[00:46:45] was a gap that they found you know from
[00:46:47] their model and they realized that it
[00:46:48] wasn't filled through your explanation
[00:46:50] and it wasn't filled in their own schema
[00:46:51] so I mean personality is dependent you
[00:46:54] have to have someone that's actually
[00:46:55] willing to look at it which you know can
[00:46:57] be hard to find but you know they will
[00:46:58] go and actually look at it a little bit
[00:47:00] more and they'll you know they'll come
[00:47:01] back and then it becomes a lot more of a
[00:47:03] you know like a real relationship rather
[00:47:06] than just like you know basically
[00:47:08] waterfall yeah it's like they're
[00:47:09] questioning and searching from the
[00:47:11] get-go right and the amount of ownership
[00:47:13] that that places on them yeah that's a
[00:47:15] big thing and I don't need to explain
[00:47:16] that yeah well you just that that's a
[00:47:19] great method because it actually makes
[00:47:21] them aware of their competency
[00:47:24] um you know local hierarchical
[00:47:25] competency and it kind of makes them
[00:47:27] jump a level where they realize oh
[00:47:28] actually I'm sure yes yeah it brings
[00:47:30] them into that yeah conscious and
[00:47:32] competency is a magical you know first
[00:47:34] step that's the hardest step though yeah
[00:47:36] and actually one other thing this is the
[00:47:38] final thing that I'll mention here is
[00:47:39] that when you do engage with people in
[00:47:41] this way not only is it increasing the
[00:47:43] sort of ownership of it but it's also
[00:47:45] familiarizing themselves with not
[00:47:46] knowing and navigating the uncertainty
[00:47:49] of the topic so it's an incredibly
[00:47:50] important thing is that often especially
[00:47:53] if you're working with someone that's a
[00:47:54] little bit younger and is experienced
[00:47:55] they're going to be used to having
[00:47:57] certainty in things and they're going to
[00:47:58] be wanting that certainty but sometimes
[00:48:00] what's most important is what can you
[00:48:02] build out of the uncertainty and how
[00:48:03] long can you stay in that uncertainty to
[00:48:05] build something that makes sense to get
[00:48:07] to certainty a lot of people are too
[00:48:08] eager to get to that certainty and so
[00:48:10] they sacrifice building that structure
[00:48:12] so it'll be like this I need certainty
[00:48:13] here so they just build that and they
[00:48:15] lock it in and it's like oh this other
[00:48:16] thing comes in it's like oh but it
[00:48:18] doesn't it doesn't fit doesn't make
[00:48:19] sense they don't know how to navigate
[00:48:20] that starting in this method starts with
[00:48:22] uncertainty because there's no
[00:48:23] expectation they're going to get it
[00:48:24] right no one in their right mind would
[00:48:26] say hey build this mental model and then
[00:48:27] if it's wrong it's like you suck you
[00:48:29] know you well as long as you don't say
[00:48:30] that you know so it creates not only
[00:48:33] sort of the mutual understanding that
[00:48:36] that uncertainty is okay the familiarity
[00:48:38] for them to navigate that uncertainty by
[00:48:40] themselves so even when you're not there
[00:48:41] and if they take on a higher level
[00:48:43] responsibility they have all the
[00:48:45] groundwork they know how to think about
[00:48:46] it or they are lacking now is the cue
[00:48:49] yeah okay thank you everyone for taking
[00:48:52] the time to come in yeah
[00:48:55] foreign

=== Are you about to burn out? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqTrKE72pzg

[00:00:00] if you're getting to the point where
[00:00:01] you're like Optima and by the evening
[00:00:02] you're like a little dull and the next
[00:00:04] morning you're afternoon by the next day
[00:00:05] you're a little bit dull that's
[00:00:06] sustainable but if you're getting to the
[00:00:08] point where you're in that maintenance
[00:00:09] mode where you're actually you're being
[00:00:11] like what you're what you're feeling is
[00:00:12] not that you're recharging the top that
[00:00:14] feeling of like recovering and coming
[00:00:16] back is literally like you just
[00:00:18] fluctuating at this bottom while it's
[00:00:19] slowly getting worse and worse and what
[00:00:21] that feels like is you never feel like
[00:00:23] you're super super sharp you just wake
[00:00:25] up and you're tired and you're exhausted
[00:00:26] and you start exhausted and you get even
[00:00:28] more exhausted and the point that you
[00:00:30] stop is where you feel like you're not
[00:00:32] even completely functional anymore and
[00:00:33] then the next morning you barely just
[00:00:35] get to the point where you can function
[00:00:36] and then you get to the point where you
[00:00:38] can't function like that means that
[00:00:39] you're at the bottom already kind of
[00:00:41] fluctuating there and that sustained
[00:00:43] over a period of time creates burnout


=== How to do scheduling properly? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkFjC2JIKJk

[00:00:00] scheduling scheduling is overrated
[00:00:03] scheduling is important you should be
[00:00:05] able to do good basic scheduling
[00:00:07] following some very basic good
[00:00:09] principles that will help you to keep on
[00:00:11] track and have decent time management
[00:00:12] but people think about scheduling as if
[00:00:15] it's going to be the thing that saves
[00:00:16] their life if you've got decent enough
[00:00:18] just very very basic scheduling and you
[00:00:20] still have problems more scheduling or
[00:00:22] better scheduling is probably not going
[00:00:23] to help you it's going to be another
[00:00:25] kind of issue which is a which is a
[00:00:27] whole other topic around time management
[00:00:29] versus task management but overall
[00:00:30] scheduling is a little overhyped


=== How to use method of loci correctly? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuL3yAieH_g

[00:00:00] method of low-cut method of loci is I
[00:00:03] think it's overrated and I teach it very
[00:00:06] very very late in in my program because
[00:00:08] there's two things number one if you
[00:00:10] learn the method of loci system it
[00:00:11] allows you to memorize a lot of content
[00:00:12] but the content is often not very
[00:00:14] practically useful first of all you're
[00:00:16] memorizing it only for lower order needs
[00:00:17] so you can only use it for like basic
[00:00:18] recall and the other thing is that
[00:00:20] you're not able to encode a lot of
[00:00:23] information on a diverse range of topics
[00:00:25] for a long period of time because it
[00:00:26] relies on you having this kind of like
[00:00:28] distinct palaces or loci and then they
[00:00:31] start overlapping and it gets even more
[00:00:32] confusing so it's a great almost like a
[00:00:34] party trick or it's really good for very
[00:00:36] specific instances when adopted in the
[00:00:38] right way but generally I think
[00:00:40] especially like memory Champions that
[00:00:42] are like oh this is going to change your
[00:00:44] life like if you learn this technique
[00:00:45] you're going to be able to like smash
[00:00:46] through your study as an Acer that's
[00:00:48] just completely not like supported and
[00:00:50] frankly I think irresponsible so from
[00:00:52] that view I think method of Loca is
[00:00:53] probably overrated


=== The Truth About Motivation ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpOtfLdGQbE

[00:00:00] for motivation for those with executive
[00:00:01] dysfunction I think one of the most
[00:00:03] important things about motivation is
[00:00:04] understanding that motivation is really
[00:00:06] valuable to have in reserve when you
[00:00:08] really need it but if you find yourself
[00:00:09] relying on needing motivation very often
[00:00:12] then it probably means that there's
[00:00:13] other things that are going on you don't
[00:00:15] want most of your behavior to be driven
[00:00:17] by motivation because that suggests that
[00:00:19] the system that you've created around
[00:00:20] trying to create behaviors and actions
[00:00:22] is making you not want to do it right
[00:00:24] like if you naturally wanted to let's
[00:00:27] take play in games for example like
[00:00:28] games are designed to be fun they're
[00:00:30] designed for you to like get into them
[00:00:31] very easily very quickly so you don't
[00:00:34] tend to need motivation to play games
[00:00:36] same thing with social media social
[00:00:38] media is designed to like suck you and
[00:00:39] get you hooked right you know you often
[00:00:41] don't find people saying I need to be
[00:00:42] more motivated so that I can binge
[00:00:44] Netflix or you know like scroll through
[00:00:46] scroll through my Instagram so the
[00:00:48] things that we need motivation for are
[00:00:50] the ones where we can't create a system
[00:00:52] in an environment that directs us
[00:00:54] towards desired Behavior but that should
[00:00:56] always be the first option if you try to
[00:00:57] create that desired Behavior


=== Problem with tying self-worth to grades ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE8zg3Hcp8U

[00:00:00] Grace grades are super overrated people
[00:00:03] tie their self-worth to it and this is
[00:00:05] coming from someone that actually you
[00:00:06] know like I make a living from teaching
[00:00:09] people to get better grades and I would
[00:00:11] say that you know when when you're
[00:00:13] fixing on grades as your outcome and
[00:00:15] that's what is like the most important
[00:00:17] to you and that's like conditional for
[00:00:19] you to feel good about yourself I mean
[00:00:21] that's just like nothing about that is
[00:00:23] is healthy or productive or even leads
[00:00:26] to success long term so grades overrated

=== Why you need self awareness to get a job? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpbkB3VtaF8

[00:00:00] the second thing is try to develop some
[00:00:02] level of self-awareness and when I say
[00:00:05] self-awareness I'm not talking about
[00:00:06] this like rural hippie just you know be
[00:00:08] more in line with your chakras like sit
[00:00:10] so that your meridians are you know in
[00:00:12] tune like when I'm saying self-awareness
[00:00:14] I'm just simply saying be aware of what
[00:00:16] you're doing why you're doing it and
[00:00:17] whether there is alignment there and
[00:00:19] start making some small changes to those
[00:00:22] why am I talking about this number one
[00:00:24] the obvious thing is that once you start
[00:00:25] being in tune to your processes and your
[00:00:27] intentions and whether they're aligned
[00:00:29] you'll start being able to optimize a
[00:00:30] lot of things


=== How to study math EFFECTIVELY? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7LRghZCKDg

[00:00:00] the first thing is that math has a lot
[00:00:02] of procedure and conditional components
[00:00:03] to it a big part of math will be
[00:00:05] dependent on being able to do good
[00:00:06] interleaved retrieval however mass is
[00:00:09] typically taught with only a procedure
[00:00:11] and conditional Focus the declarative
[00:00:12] aspects of maths are often either not
[00:00:14] taught at all or like very very very
[00:00:16] understated but if you like literally
[00:00:17] just like go on YouTube and like listen
[00:00:19] to these math prodigies and establish
[00:00:21] professors of mathematics talk about the
[00:00:23] best way to learn math they all say that
[00:00:25] before you learn how to use the equation
[00:00:27] formulas you should understand in words
[00:00:29] what it is that you're learning and why
[00:00:31] you're learning it the difficulty is
[00:00:33] that when you first receive the
[00:00:35] information when it's taught to you it's
[00:00:36] taught to you in a way that is far
[00:00:38] removed from that level of conceptual
[00:00:39] understanding and that's where the
[00:00:41] effort comes in a big part of being able
[00:00:43] to solve complex problems like a lot of
[00:00:45] stuff in calculus is understanding
[00:00:47] conceptually how to approach the problem
[00:00:51] before you even think about the numbers
[00:00:52] and the formulas as part of it

=== How to learn something completely new outside of school? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIJjTgAStg4

[00:00:00] when you're trying to learn something
[00:00:01] how do you find the right materials to
[00:00:03] study that subject when you're letting
[00:00:04] it outside of school where the materials
[00:00:06] are not provided to you there are a lot
[00:00:08] of different ways and it depends a lot
[00:00:10] on the context of what you're trying to
[00:00:11] learn one of the ways that I would do it
[00:00:13] is find the broadest possible source of
[00:00:16] information that you can around that
[00:00:17] topic and then use it as a springboard
[00:00:19] for finding additional resources the old
[00:00:21] school way that you would normally do
[00:00:23] this is you just find a book that kind
[00:00:25] of summarizes it because books are
[00:00:26] usually written to be a little bit more
[00:00:28] Layman friendly than like hardcore
[00:00:30] research articles or you know I'd look
[00:00:31] for systematic reviews on a certain
[00:00:33] topic or something but honestly look in
[00:00:35] the Modern Age today if I was doing that
[00:00:37] now I'm going to Chuck it in like chat
[00:00:39] GPT or an AO I'm just going to ask what
[00:00:41] are the main things I need to think
[00:00:42] about and then recommend me some books
[00:00:43] as long as you have a basic starting
[00:00:45] point that's fine one pro tip that I'd
[00:00:47] recommend though is never start with a
[00:00:48] single Source you want to have it at
[00:00:50] least two but up to five different
[00:00:52] sources of information you want that
[00:00:54] broad reach


=== How to save time in studying your masters? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-dhQTUTC-k

[00:00:00] when we look at where we can save time
[00:00:01] these are some of the common things that
[00:00:03] I've noticed and worked with when it
[00:00:04] comes to people that are in their sort
[00:00:05] of Masters and PhD levels comparing and
[00:00:08] prioritizing multiple resources I mean
[00:00:10] that's come up often evaluating the
[00:00:12] potential Direction so again that comes
[00:00:13] down to prioritizing as well even within
[00:00:15] a single document understanding and
[00:00:16] evaluating the best methodologies so
[00:00:18] methodologies in terms of how you're
[00:00:20] going to for example fracture your
[00:00:22] review process what method you're going
[00:00:24] to use to do your uh you know analysis
[00:00:27] or the type of study or even sometimes
[00:00:29] what method you're going to use to even
[00:00:31] write do the writing in the first place
[00:00:32] you know so all of these are different
[00:00:34] methods and each has a benefit you know
[00:00:36] advantage and disadvantage and they're
[00:00:37] suited for different types of context
[00:00:39] and sometimes you mix and you match and
[00:00:40] actually it takes a long time just to
[00:00:42] understand enough about the different
[00:00:44] methodologies to even be able to make a
[00:00:46] conclusion about which one you want to
[00:00:47] go with and that can sometimes take
[00:00:48] actually months because you might go
[00:00:50] down One path and then you realize oh no
[00:00:52] this doesn't work anymore and then you
[00:00:53] have to just start again this is where a
[00:00:54] lot of time can be saved


=== Learning Coach Rates Productivity Apps ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_U0n2KciB0

[00:00:00] hey everyone it's Dr Justin sung here
[00:00:01] I'm a former medical doctor and now
[00:00:03] full-time learning coaching consultant
[00:00:04] and welcome to another episode of
[00:00:06] overrated underrated where we're going
[00:00:08] to be going through lots of different
[00:00:09] ideas and I'm going to be explaining my
[00:00:11] take on them as briefly as possible
[00:00:20] I'd say it's obsidian is properly rated
[00:00:24] uh because I know it's getting popular
[00:00:26] and it is popular there are lots of
[00:00:28] other people and there's other you know
[00:00:29] YouTubers and influence and stuff that
[00:00:31] can talk about obsidian much better than
[00:00:32] I can I think it's a very good app I use
[00:00:36] it for for some purposes I think for
[00:00:38] studying specifically I don't think
[00:00:39] obsidian is great because it runs into
[00:00:41] the same issues as linear note taking
[00:00:42] and inorganic relational forming and it
[00:00:45] doesn't reflect your higher order
[00:00:46] knowledge structures as it would if you
[00:00:49] were to encode it properly from a
[00:00:50] cognitive perspective but I think as an
[00:00:53] app to help you as a second brain
[00:00:54] especially I think it's a great app so
[00:00:56] I'd say properly rated it's got a lot of
[00:00:58] popularity it's growing and I think it's
[00:00:59] well deserved
[00:01:01] Rim notes
[00:01:03] um
[00:01:07] okay well look I'm gonna have to say
[00:01:08] sorry to Mike and Maddie because I I
[00:01:11] know the guys and I like the guys I I
[00:01:13] think the software REM note is a little
[00:01:15] overrated
[00:01:16] um I don't think it really tackles the
[00:01:18] issues of higher order learning and
[00:01:19] non-linear relational note-taking or the
[00:01:21] higher order knowledge structures that
[00:01:22] we've been talking about I don't think
[00:01:23] it covers those things very well um
[00:01:25] again it does it from a software
[00:01:28] perspective like how can we create
[00:01:29] relationships from a database
[00:01:30] perspective rather than looking at it
[00:01:32] from how can we do it in a way that
[00:01:33] actually facilitates the right cognitive
[00:01:34] process which is really a different ball
[00:01:37] game
[00:01:38] um so I would say that I think it is a
[00:01:41] little overrated yeah
[00:01:45] [Music]
[00:01:48] Daily Reflection I think is underrated
[00:01:51] because not many people do it just to
[00:01:53] note that just because you are doing
[00:01:55] Daily Reflection doesn't mean that
[00:01:56] you're getting all the value of daily
[00:01:57] reflection and in some cases Daily
[00:01:59] Reflection can actually make things
[00:02:00] worse especially if you're using that as
[00:02:02] like a a trigger point for negative
[00:02:04] spiraling so I think proper reflective
[00:02:06] technique is super super super
[00:02:08] underrated and if you have proper
[00:02:10] reflective technique and daily
[00:02:11] journaling I think that can be a very
[00:02:12] powerful combination how about free
[00:02:14] writing I'd say it's probably underrated
[00:02:16] as well it's a great way of just getting
[00:02:18] your thoughts out and helping you
[00:02:19] document and helping you slow down your
[00:02:20] thought processes and be a little bit
[00:02:22] more critical it's great for developing
[00:02:23] metacognition as well so for those
[00:02:25] reasons and because of the fact that
[00:02:26] most people don't use it and actually
[00:02:28] probably most people don't even know
[00:02:29] what it means I would say it's
[00:02:31] underrated daily affirmations uh
[00:02:34] uh daily affirmations it's quite a trend
[00:02:37] these days it's quite trendy these days
[00:02:39] so for that reason I'd say it's I'm
[00:02:41] gonna say it's properly rated I think I
[00:02:43] think it was underrated I think it's
[00:02:45] right now it's properly rated because
[00:02:46] it's it's becoming more popular and
[00:02:47] people are starting to understand that
[00:02:48] it's great for positive reinforcement
[00:02:50] and building that positive psychology
[00:02:53] um and helping to sort of break out of
[00:02:55] learn helplessness behaviors maybe if
[00:02:57] you asked me a year from now I might say
[00:02:59] it's overrated because there are
[00:03:00] branches of daily affirmation to sign a
[00:03:02] branch out into this kind of like
[00:03:03] mystical hippie like woo like I'm gonna
[00:03:05] do my daily affirmation as I look and
[00:03:07] rub into my magical crystal ball and
[00:03:09] like rub salt all over my hair like it's
[00:03:11] starting to Branch into this weird
[00:03:13] territory that's a little off so
[00:03:15] especially on Tick Tock it's it's very
[00:03:18] like you know kills my faith in humanity
[00:03:20] so uh at the moment I'm gonna say
[00:03:22] properly rated but maybe in the future
[00:03:24] it's going to become overrated writing
[00:03:26] about no anxieties I I think writing
[00:03:28] about anxieties is again it's it's
[00:03:30] helpful if you have structure and
[00:03:33] guidance and you know how to do it in a
[00:03:34] pro active way but I also know that
[00:03:35] writing about anxiety is not always
[00:03:37] productive and it can in some cases feed
[00:03:39] into anxiety and anxiety cycles and
[00:03:42] anxiety spirals I'd say
[00:03:44] um the guidance of like a psychologist
[00:03:45] or a clinical clinical psychologist or
[00:03:46] therapist even is going to be helpful
[00:03:48] for you to know how you can reflect in a
[00:03:50] more productive way but overall I'd say
[00:03:55] it's I'd say it's underrated because
[00:03:57] most of the people that I know with
[00:03:58] anxiety do not write about it or
[00:03:59] document it or try to be metacognitive
[00:04:01] or that reflective about it at all
[00:04:05] to-do lists when I was in my first year
[00:04:08] of uni I used to have this thing I
[00:04:09] called the to-do list of death which
[00:04:11] meant that I would write things on my
[00:04:13] to-do list and I would either get them
[00:04:14] done or I would die that was my mindset
[00:04:16] I was very extreme I was very very
[00:04:18] extreme 18 year old okay
[00:04:21] um now thinking about it I think to-do
[00:04:23] lists are properly rated I think it's a
[00:04:26] very good way for helping you to
[00:04:27] document obviously your tasks it's a
[00:04:29] good springboard for helping you with
[00:04:30] prioritization the prioritization part I
[00:04:33] think is underrated and people aren't
[00:04:34] really doing it just having it on a
[00:04:36] to-do list is not enough a to-do list by
[00:04:38] itself in isolation is not enough but
[00:04:40] it's a prerequisite for good
[00:04:42] prioritization which is one of the most
[00:04:44] high yield things that you can be doing
[00:04:45] in your life it's properly rated for
[00:04:47] that reason people use it people love it
[00:04:49] it's good for all of those reasons the
[00:04:51] only overrated part about it would be if
[00:04:53] people are just thinking that having it
[00:04:55] on a to-do list actually means that that
[00:04:56] means you're going to be productive
[00:04:59] drawing or doodling is overall
[00:05:03] underrated but most people aren't really
[00:05:07] doodling in a way that is productive
[00:05:09] like most people are doodling like
[00:05:10] making the you know organic chemistry
[00:05:12] it's like oh yeah history like they're
[00:05:15] drawing out you know making it really
[00:05:16] pretty but growing and doodling is a
[00:05:18] great way of representing information
[00:05:19] non-verbally which is important because
[00:05:21] your visual processing has tens of
[00:05:23] thousands of times faster than your
[00:05:24] written word processing but also because
[00:05:26] of the fact that it allows you to
[00:05:27] express more information in a way that
[00:05:29] is non-directional which is the way that
[00:05:31] knowledge is inherently sort of
[00:05:33] non-linear and omnidirectional so trying
[00:05:35] to represent it linearly means that you
[00:05:36] lock yourself into learning it in a
[00:05:38] linear flow whereas drawings and doodles
[00:05:40] can actually break that open you can
[00:05:41] look at like an image all at once and
[00:05:43] one go and take in lots of information
[00:05:44] all in one go and that is a very
[00:05:46] underrated part of of learning
[00:05:50] techniques mindfulness meditation
[00:05:53] overrated or underrated mindfulness
[00:05:55] meditation is underrated mindfulness
[00:05:57] meditation used to be something that was
[00:05:59] like not well known and now it is
[00:06:02] something that's very well known by lots
[00:06:04] of people I'm continually surprised by
[00:06:06] how much like people are starting to
[00:06:07] know this and I think apps and things
[00:06:09] have done a great thing to try to push
[00:06:10] that out to more people and popularize
[00:06:12] and normalize it so that's that's a good
[00:06:13] thing I think people still underrate the
[00:06:16] value that it has mindfulness meditation
[00:06:18] is not one of those things that usually
[00:06:19] provides a short-term immediate benefit
[00:06:22] especially if you're a beginner to it
[00:06:23] it's kind of like working out you need
[00:06:25] to work out for a period of time before
[00:06:27] you can use that transferably and the
[00:06:30] other thing is that when you're training
[00:06:31] mindfulness meditation uh like it's the
[00:06:33] getting distracted is the point bringing
[00:06:35] yourself back from the distraction and
[00:06:37] letting that go and being mindful that's
[00:06:38] actually the point so some people are
[00:06:39] put off by the fact that they're so
[00:06:41] easily distracted it's like going into a
[00:06:42] gym and being put off by the fact that
[00:06:44] you need to move so that was the point
[00:06:46] of it so I think if you didn't
[00:06:48] understand that you would severely
[00:06:50] underrate it and I think that the way
[00:06:52] that most people do underrate it so
[00:06:53] therefore I think it is still underrated
[00:06:55] Focus meditation
[00:06:57] well focused meditation is really a I
[00:07:00] think personally I I think it could be
[00:07:02] viewed as really a subset of mindfulness
[00:07:04] meditation in fact all these meditative
[00:07:05] practices kind of
[00:07:07] end up sort of blending together the
[00:07:09] only difference is the intention behind
[00:07:10] it and also there isn't really clear
[00:07:12] research that differentiates the
[00:07:14] benefits of different forms of
[00:07:15] meditation from each other so if you
[00:07:18] look at something like
[00:07:19] um like very secular meditation
[00:07:21] practices versus something that's more
[00:07:22] like religious or Transcendental
[00:07:24] Meditation you're not really seeing that
[00:07:25] there are unique differences for each of
[00:07:28] these at least not when you look at the
[00:07:30] research as a whole
[00:07:31] so I think meditation as a as a whole is
[00:07:34] just good to do and if you're wanting to
[00:07:36] use it for Focus whether you wanted to
[00:07:38] use it to calm down whether you want to
[00:07:39] use it to detach or just you know deal
[00:07:41] with anxiety or whatever it is I think
[00:07:43] that's just up to you to pick your
[00:07:45] intention but it's just good overall
[00:07:49] movement meditation
[00:07:51] hmm movement rotation I'm going to say
[00:07:53] is actually even more underrated than
[00:07:55] the other ones and I'm going to say this
[00:07:56] because I know lots of people that will
[00:07:58] meditate and they'll practice
[00:07:59] mindfulness but they won't understand
[00:08:01] how they can translate or transfer or
[00:08:03] use that technique in their daily life
[00:08:05] so for example they may do their
[00:08:07] meditation like every evening or
[00:08:08] something for like 20 minutes and then
[00:08:10] but during the day when they have like
[00:08:11] oh I'm getting stressed or flustered or
[00:08:13] anxious they don't think they use that
[00:08:15] same technique at the time one thing
[00:08:17] that I think movement meditation helps
[00:08:19] you to do is understand that you can be
[00:08:21] in a meditative state of mind without
[00:08:22] being in a meditative conventional pose
[00:08:25] you can embody meditative practices just
[00:08:28] just you know while you're walking while
[00:08:30] you're cleaning while you're doing the
[00:08:31] dishes while you are you know whatever
[00:08:33] and just breaking it into the mode of
[00:08:36] everyday life as a skill that you can
[00:08:38] use and a tool that you've just got in
[00:08:40] your toolkit I think that's a view that
[00:08:42] people often don't have about meditation
[00:08:43] and so I'll say it's underrated for that
[00:08:45] reason so that's it for this episode of
[00:08:46] overrated underrated if there's anything
[00:08:48] that I mentioned that you want me to
[00:08:49] dive into in more detail please leave a
[00:08:51] comment down below below let me know
[00:08:52] what it is that you want me to dive into
[00:08:54] and also specify the question about what
[00:08:57] aspect of it you want me to dive into in
[00:08:59] the very very first overrated underrated
[00:09:01] video that we did for this I just said
[00:09:03] leave a comment below on what you want
[00:09:04] me to expand on people just said like
[00:09:05] the word expand on it and I was like
[00:09:07] what about it so that that was my fault
[00:09:09] this time be a little bit more specific
[00:09:11] but anyway thank you for watching if you
[00:09:12] like this stuff leave a like leave a

=== Are you really on the right career path? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXf2ENPRw70

[00:00:00] you're probably not going to know enough
[00:00:02] about medicine before you actually do
[00:00:05] the job first of all look for
[00:00:06] Alternatives a lot of people get very
[00:00:07] fixed on medicine and they don't think
[00:00:09] about the Alternatives they don't think
[00:00:10] about it realistically try to find
[00:00:11] reasons that you actively wouldn't like
[00:00:13] medicine we often do that for the fields
[00:00:16] that we don't want to think about like
[00:00:17] do that for the ones that you feel like
[00:00:18] you do want to do it it's better to
[00:00:20] understand the reasons you wouldn't want
[00:00:22] to do something and balance and consider
[00:00:24] that because what's important is not for
[00:00:25] you to just have the security of being
[00:00:27] like yes I finally picked a career I
[00:00:29] want to go down what's important is for
[00:00:30] you to make a legitimately good decision
[00:00:32] for your career the other thing I'd say
[00:00:34] is really get to know your personality
[00:00:36] what is and is not acceptable for you
[00:00:38] you're probably not going to know that
[00:00:40] unless you have enough experience under
[00:00:41] your game life experience start
[00:00:43] understanding where your values are what
[00:00:45] you really need to have in your life and
[00:00:47] one of the things that you think you
[00:00:48] need to have but you probably don't need
[00:00:51] to it might not be as important as you
[00:00:52] thought it was


=== Simplest way to upgrade your note taking ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAqsgoC9la4

[00:00:00] note-taking the biggest tip that I have
[00:00:02] is minimize the amount of words that
[00:00:03] you'll use there are studies that have
[00:00:04] been done on word count and it tends to
[00:00:07] show that people that have higher word
[00:00:09] count in their notes will perform worse
[00:00:12] because the hypothesis is that if your
[00:00:14] word count is higher you're not actually
[00:00:15] thinking about and processing the
[00:00:17] information as deeply


=== How to make what you're studying feel relevant? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKjgrK9On4o

[00:00:00] you're always going on about how the
[00:00:02] path the more efficient studying is
[00:00:03] Define the path of relevance how do you
[00:00:05] know what is relevant so your brain is
[00:00:08] fairly good at understanding what is
[00:00:10] relevant and it tends to do it based on
[00:00:12] the piece of information is heavily
[00:00:14] connected to what your prior knowledge
[00:00:16] already is so if you already have lots
[00:00:17] of praying knowledge or something you
[00:00:18] naturally find something more relevant
[00:00:20] like because there's a new piece of
[00:00:21] information and you already know around
[00:00:23] it and you might find that more relevant
[00:00:25] so one is just the intuitive sense that
[00:00:29] this feels like it will be easier and
[00:00:32] more understandable second thing is
[00:00:33] based on curiosity if your brain is
[00:00:36] curious about something and there was
[00:00:37] some kind of like surrounding Network
[00:00:38] and there's a gap there and you're aware
[00:00:40] of that Gap your brain wants to figure
[00:00:41] it out if you let yourself be followed a
[00:00:44] little bit by your curiosity if you try
[00:00:47] to deliberately create relevance by
[00:00:50] connecting it with what you already know
[00:00:51] maybe trying to create analogies those
[00:00:53] are both techniques that can help you to
[00:00:55] find the path of most relevance


=== Flashcards WON'T help you with learning this ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5pvCRylNAE

[00:00:00] it's really common for students to rely
[00:00:01] so heavily on apps like anky that they
[00:00:04] don't actually use any other learning
[00:00:06] methods which might be much better at
[00:00:08] building higher order knowledge networks
[00:00:12] since all knowledge must exist in a
[00:00:14] network for it to be retained and used
[00:00:18] and because flash cards are pretty bad
[00:00:21] at building knowledge networks we end up
[00:00:25] with a mountain of information we have
[00:00:27] to learn through pure rote memorization
[00:00:30] and repetition even if we didn't need to
[00:00:32] in the first place it actually creates
[00:00:34] unnecessary work for us and it's a very
[00:00:36] Brute Force way of trying to study a
[00:00:38] topic


=== Here's why you're overwhelmed by flashcards ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqyPVPLWjE0

[00:00:00] flash cards get overwhelming very
[00:00:02] quickly if you try to use flash cards to
[00:00:04] learn absolutely everything then you get
[00:00:05] to a point where you have to do hundreds
[00:00:07] of flash cards every single day and then
[00:00:09] once you do get overwhelmed by the
[00:00:11] volume of flash cards it's actually very
[00:00:13] hard to escape because now you're
[00:00:15] investing so much of your time into
[00:00:17] doing your flash cards that you can't
[00:00:19] use other methods without falling behind
[00:00:22] and this is very timec consuming and
[00:00:23] also not very effective human memory
[00:00:25] excels when knowledge is connected into
[00:00:28] a network when information is less
[00:00:31] connected in a network your brain holds
[00:00:33] on to that information much less
[00:00:35] strongly which means you forget it more
[00:00:36] easily


=== Homework could be a waste of time. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dysM8pfRxb8

[00:00:00] the research on homework is quite like I
[00:00:01] don't know if controversial is the right
[00:00:03] word but it basically says that at a
[00:00:04] group level homework seems to improve
[00:00:06] great so group level data like across an
[00:00:08] entire School population says that it's
[00:00:10] helpful however on an individual basis
[00:00:12] there is no effect or it's actually a
[00:00:14] negative impact


=== Why Elon Musk's schedule is useless for us ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-2t8VG8S10

[00:00:00] I know that there are these stories of
[00:00:01] like Elon Musk who apparently used to
[00:00:03] time block his day into five minute
[00:00:04] intervals which is absolutely insane and
[00:00:06] I tried doing that I actually time
[00:00:08] blocked my day into five minute
[00:00:09] intervals for like nine to ten months
[00:00:11] when I was in like fourth or fifth year
[00:00:12] of uni um and number one it was really
[00:00:13] really stressful and number two it was
[00:00:15] extremely rigid and I would say unless
[00:00:17] you're running like four to five like
[00:00:18] internationally world-changing companies
[00:00:20] simultaneously uh it's probably not
[00:00:22] going to be necessary for most people to
[00:00:24] do that I mean even when I was working
[00:00:25] full-time and medical school like
[00:00:27] juggling both of them simultaneously I
[00:00:28] never felt the need to really do
[00:00:30] extensive time blocking that was super
[00:00:32] micromanaged when I started flipping my
[00:00:34] attention to being super super strict
[00:00:37] and really rigorous with my task
[00:00:39] management that's what really just
[00:00:41] opened the door before that I was always
[00:00:43] feeling like it was me against the clock
[00:00:45] but when I opened up to just really
[00:00:46] focusing on task management then it felt
[00:00:49] like I wasn't really having to try that
[00:00:51] hard but when I looked at it across like
[00:00:53] a weekly basis I was making considerable
[00:00:55] progress on the most important things
[00:00:56] that I needed to do and it felt much
[00:00:59] more natural


=== How to use Anki like a PRO (by a Learning Expert) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eauQac_23R0

[00:00:00] did you know that there is a more
[00:00:02] advanced way of using flashcard apps
[00:00:05] like Anki I'm willing to bet you did it
[00:00:07] because it took me years of using
[00:00:09] flashcards and reading through research
[00:00:11] to figure this out in this video I'm
[00:00:13] going to tell you what flashcards are
[00:00:14] great for and what they are terrible for
[00:00:16] even though a lot of people still use
[00:00:18] them this way and at the end of this
[00:00:19] video I'm going to tell you my strategy
[00:00:21] for how you can make flash cards less
[00:00:23] overwhelming more memorable and you can
[00:00:26] triple their effectiveness I've taught
[00:00:28] the strategy very successfully to
[00:00:30] hundreds of students over the years and
[00:00:32] whether you're using Anki or any other
[00:00:34] flashcard app there are things that you
[00:00:36] can do to make them dramatically more
[00:00:38] effective if you're new to this channel
[00:00:40] welcome I'm Dr Justin sung I'm a
[00:00:42] learning coach and researcher in the
[00:00:43] head of learning at I can study I'm also
[00:00:45] a former medical doctor for the last
[00:00:46] decade I've taught tens of thousands of
[00:00:48] students around the world to learn more
[00:00:50] efficiently now a couple years ago one
[00:00:52] of the videos that really blew up on my
[00:00:54] channel was the problems with space
[00:00:56] repetition and active recall and if your
[00:00:58] system of learning does depend on Space
[00:01:01] repetition then there are some serious
[00:01:03] problems with it that I do talk about in
[00:01:05] all of my other videos but it doesn't
[00:01:08] mean that flash cards do not have its
[00:01:11] place in fact I've probably used flash
[00:01:13] cards more than most people after all I
[00:01:16] crossed my medical degree my honors
[00:01:18] degree my Master's Degree my learning
[00:01:21] teaching certification I've spent over
[00:01:23] eight years learning at Uni to
[00:01:26] eventually become top ranked flashcards
[00:01:28] including apps like Anki can be a very
[00:01:31] effective and useful tool in your
[00:01:33] toolkit but like any tool we have to
[00:01:35] know how to use it properly for example
[00:01:37] you might have the best screwdriver in
[00:01:40] the world but you can't build an entire
[00:01:42] house with nothing else but a
[00:01:44] screwdriver at least not without
[00:01:45] seriously abusing your screwdriver
[00:01:47] taking 10 years longer than it needed to
[00:01:49] and probably injuring yourself in the
[00:01:51] process so let's take a quick look at
[00:01:52] what flash cards are good at and what
[00:01:54] they are bad at and then I'll tell you
[00:01:55] the strategy for how you can increase
[00:01:56] the good and reduce the bad before we
[00:01:58] get into it I'd really appreciate if you
[00:01:59] give this video video a like it really
[00:02:01] helps with the algorithm so most flash
[00:02:02] cards work like this you have a prompt
[00:02:05] which could be a question or a fill in
[00:02:08] the blanks or an image occlusion which
[00:02:10] is basically just fill in the blanks
[00:02:11] with an image you then answer it from
[00:02:13] memory and Market as correct or
[00:02:14] incorrect some apps even let you rate
[00:02:16] how easy it was to get that answer right
[00:02:19] and that affects the spacing algorithm
[00:02:21] and then depending on how long that
[00:02:22] algorithm calculated for you you're then
[00:02:24] prompted to answer that question again
[00:02:26] and this could be even just a few
[00:02:28] minutes later up to weeks flashcards are
[00:02:30] useful for three main reasons firstly it
[00:02:33] triggers active retrieval of knowledge
[00:02:35] which has well proven benefits on your
[00:02:37] memory and retention now the research is
[00:02:39] surprisingly complicated here much more
[00:02:41] complicated than a lot of people make it
[00:02:42] out to be so we're not going to go into
[00:02:43] exactly why and how it helps you but in
[00:02:46] summary actively retrieving your
[00:02:49] knowledge is a very important part of
[00:02:50] any Learning System and you should
[00:02:52] definitely do it no Learning System is
[00:02:54] complete without having retrieval
[00:02:56] practice the problems can arise when you
[00:02:58] rely on the retrieval too much but we'll
[00:03:01] get to that later secondly it makes it
[00:03:03] very easy to space your repetitions out
[00:03:05] and it allows you to repeat stuff not at
[00:03:07] a topic or subject level but add a fact
[00:03:09] or at a concept level depending on your
[00:03:12] ability to recall that fact or concept
[00:03:13] repetition to some extent is always
[00:03:15] going to be necessary for learning so
[00:03:16] flashcard apps make this a lot easier
[00:03:19] honestly the person that invented the
[00:03:21] digital lateness system is a genius
[00:03:23] trying to manage this with a manual
[00:03:25] calendar and a schedule and tracking
[00:03:27] every single thing that you got right or
[00:03:29] wrong would be a nightmare and extremely
[00:03:31] time consuming and time consuming isn't
[00:03:33] always a bad thing but in this case that
[00:03:34] time is not invested in learning it's
[00:03:37] just admin time and lastly it helps with
[00:03:39] something called micro learning micro
[00:03:41] learning is when you have these study
[00:03:43] sessions that are very concentrated and
[00:03:45] short bursts of time like only a few
[00:03:48] minutes long and for some very
[00:03:49] complicated reasons that we haven't
[00:03:51] fully figured out yet micro learning
[00:03:52] tends to be quite effective having these
[00:03:54] concentrated shorter bursts of studying
[00:03:56] tends to have a disproportionately high
[00:03:59] benefit for your memory and your
[00:04:01] attention now that isn't to say that
[00:04:03] having longer study sessions is not
[00:04:06] useful what it means is that having the
[00:04:09] shorter ones that are only like three to
[00:04:11] seven minutes long are also useful so
[00:04:14] flashcards are great for this you can
[00:04:15] use flash cards when you're waiting for
[00:04:16] the bus when you're on the toilet when
[00:04:18] you're waiting to order a coffee you
[00:04:20] could stack up to maybe 20 or 30 minutes
[00:04:22] a day of micro learning without actually
[00:04:25] scheduling any extra time you're just
[00:04:27] using these pockets of time that you
[00:04:29] might not have been able to utilize
[00:04:31] before and so when you look at these
[00:04:32] three main benefits you can see it's
[00:04:34] genuinely very useful add on top of the
[00:04:36] fact that it's also pretty
[00:04:37] straightforward and easy to use and it
[00:04:39] doesn't take a long time to learn to use
[00:04:41] them correctly flash cards are very very
[00:04:43] popular so what are flashcards not good
[00:04:46] at well even though flashcards trigger
[00:04:48] active retrieval of knowledge the way
[00:04:51] you retrieve the knowledge makes a big
[00:04:53] difference flashcard apps are generally
[00:04:54] designed to test you on a one-to-one
[00:04:56] ratio what that means is that you get
[00:04:58] one prompt the question that tests you
[00:05:01] on one concept or fact and this is good
[00:05:03] for Direct Factory call and memorization
[00:05:05] but it's not as helpful for the higher
[00:05:07] order learning needs where you actually
[00:05:09] need to draw on multiple Concepts and
[00:05:11] facts and how they influence and relate
[00:05:13] to each other and I talk about this
[00:05:14] concept A Lot in my other videos like
[00:05:16] all the time now you could make
[00:05:18] flashcards like a challenging exam
[00:05:21] question that tests you on these
[00:05:22] interrelated Concepts but it tends to
[00:05:24] get a little bit messy it's a lot longer
[00:05:26] to create those questions it takes
[00:05:28] longer to answer them and It's tricky to
[00:05:30] understand whether you should Mark a
[00:05:32] question right or wrong for example if
[00:05:34] your flashcard is testing you now on six
[00:05:37] or seven different concepts and facts
[00:05:39] and you get five of those correct and
[00:05:41] you miss one of them do you answer that
[00:05:44] card as correct or incorrect if you've
[00:05:47] ever tried this yourself you know that
[00:05:49] it gets pretty messy once you start
[00:05:51] testing on more than two or three facts
[00:05:53] and Concepts per card so problem number
[00:05:55] one is that it only really helps for the
[00:05:58] lower order Style Direct Factory call
[00:06:01] and memorization type of learning which
[00:06:03] is usually not enough to get you the
[00:06:06] best marks or especially if you're a
[00:06:08] union Beyond even a pass which is also
[00:06:11] part of problem number two flash cards
[00:06:13] get overwhelming very quickly if you try
[00:06:16] to use flashcards to learn absolutely
[00:06:17] everything then you get to a point where
[00:06:19] you have to do hundreds of flashcards
[00:06:21] every single day and this is very time
[00:06:22] consuming and also not very effective as
[00:06:24] I often talk about in my videos human
[00:06:26] memory excels when knowledge is
[00:06:28] connected into a network when
[00:06:31] information is less connected in a
[00:06:33] network your brain holds on to that
[00:06:35] information much less strongly which
[00:06:37] means you forget it more easily it's
[00:06:38] really common for students to rely so
[00:06:40] heavily on apps like Anki that they
[00:06:42] don't actually use any other learning
[00:06:45] methods which might be much better at
[00:06:47] building higher order knowledge networks
[00:06:50] since all knowledge must exist in a
[00:06:53] network for it to be retained and used
[00:06:56] and because flash cards are pretty bad
[00:06:59] at building knowledge networks we end up
[00:07:03] with a mountain of information we have
[00:07:06] to learn through pure root memorization
[00:07:08] and repetition even if we didn't need to
[00:07:11] in the first place it actually creates
[00:07:13] unnecessary work for us and it's a very
[00:07:15] Brute Force way of trying to study a
[00:07:17] topic and I can tell you experts in
[00:07:19] their field that know more about that
[00:07:21] field than anyone else they're not
[00:07:23] sitting at home doing flash cards on the
[00:07:25] hundreds of new Journal articles that
[00:07:27] are released every week they probably
[00:07:29] aren't using flashcards at all in fact
[00:07:31] and again it goes back to that analogy
[00:07:33] of the screwdriver yes a screwdriver can
[00:07:35] be really good at what it does and you
[00:07:37] can love using your screwdriver for
[00:07:40] tightening a screw if you've never used
[00:07:42] a screwdriver before you're going to
[00:07:43] feel that it's amazing compared to
[00:07:45] trying to tighten the screw with your
[00:07:46] fingernail but it doesn't mean that it
[00:07:48] magically solves every possible need
[00:07:52] that you have when you're building a
[00:07:53] house flashcards are great at what it's
[00:07:55] good at but when you try to use it in
[00:07:57] ways that it's not good at it's not
[00:07:59] efficient and it's actually going to do
[00:08:01] more harm than good and then once you do
[00:08:03] get overwhelmed by the volume of
[00:08:05] flashcards it's actually very hard to
[00:08:07] escape because now you're investing so
[00:08:09] much of your time into doing your
[00:08:11] flashcards you can't use other methods
[00:08:13] without falling behind and in some cases
[00:08:16] being able to get a flash card correct
[00:08:18] might actually even be harmful so this
[00:08:23] is problem number three which is that
[00:08:26] flashcards are very repetitive which is
[00:08:29] the whole point of it but there's
[00:08:32] another part to this because we repeat
[00:08:34] the same flashcard again and again we
[00:08:36] may end up memorizing the flash card
[00:08:39] rather than the actual knowledge and
[00:08:42] you've probably already experienced this
[00:08:43] before for example if you've got a flash
[00:08:45] card that asks the question what is the
[00:08:47] function of the mitochondria and the
[00:08:49] answer is mitochondria is a Powerhouse
[00:08:50] of the cell then if you do this
[00:08:52] flashcard enough times you might
[00:08:53] actually just read what is the function
[00:08:55] of and then you already know that the
[00:08:57] rest of this flashcard says might
[00:08:59] chondria then if you do this enough
[00:09:01] times you might recognize the flash card
[00:09:03] just by reading what is the Fung and at
[00:09:07] that point you already know that the
[00:09:09] rest of it's going to say function of a
[00:09:11] mitochondria and you're able to record
[00:09:12] the answer straight away without even
[00:09:14] having to read the whole question
[00:09:17] which might seem like a really good
[00:09:19] thing because your recoil is faster but
[00:09:22] it's not the problem here is that we're
[00:09:25] no longer testing our ability to recall
[00:09:28] the knowledge anymore all we're testing
[00:09:30] is our ability to associate that
[00:09:32] particular flashcard with that
[00:09:34] particular answer so when we get into an
[00:09:36] exam or any other type of assessment and
[00:09:39] we're asked on that knowledge but in a
[00:09:41] way that's different to how our flash
[00:09:43] card put it we may actually struggle to
[00:09:47] recall that knowledge because it's not
[00:09:50] testing our recall of the knowledge in
[00:09:52] itself anymore when we get these types
[00:09:55] of questions wrong we could often look
[00:09:56] at it and say well I just made a silly
[00:09:58] mistake because I already knew that but
[00:10:02] actually there's a very big and
[00:10:04] important difference between knowing
[00:10:07] something and being able to retrieve and
[00:10:11] use it in a realistic setting so as a
[00:10:15] rule of thumb if I see a student using
[00:10:18] flashcards for almost all of their
[00:10:20] learning and they end up with hundreds
[00:10:22] or even thousands of them I know that
[00:10:24] they're probably doing more harm than
[00:10:26] good like much more harm than good so
[00:10:29] therefore to make flash Cuts more
[00:10:31] effective we need to make them better at
[00:10:33] doing the higher order learning stuff
[00:10:34] and make them less overwhelming and also
[00:10:38] stop ourselves from getting into that
[00:10:39] pattern where we're just memorizing the
[00:10:40] flash card rather than the knowledge and
[00:10:42] surprisingly potentially one of the most
[00:10:44] useful things that you can actually do
[00:10:45] is to like this video and the second
[00:10:47] most important thing is to follow the
[00:10:49] strategy that I'm about to teach you now
[00:10:51] this strategy is very rare I almost
[00:10:53] never really see anyone using flashcards
[00:10:55] like this even though it is extremely
[00:10:58] extremely effective about six years ago
[00:11:00] I coached a young athlete there were
[00:11:02] world-class Olympic level athlete and
[00:11:04] they had a 30 hour per week training
[00:11:07] schedule and I was coaching them not on
[00:11:09] the Athletics I was coaching them to
[00:11:11] handle studying for uni and handle all
[00:11:13] their learning stuff while they were
[00:11:15] also doing this crazy crazy training
[00:11:18] this person had really no time to sit
[00:11:20] down and study for long periods of time
[00:11:21] the only time they had was a six hour
[00:11:23] block on a Saturday where they could get
[00:11:25] through as much studying as possible and
[00:11:27] as a result of that experience I learned
[00:11:29] a lot about micro learning and how to
[00:11:31] really make micro learning including
[00:11:33] flashcards work for you and since then
[00:11:36] I've taught these principles and
[00:11:37] techniques that I'm about to teach you
[00:11:38] to thousands of students so here's how
[00:11:40] we want to set your learning up
[00:11:42] you want to split your dedicated long
[00:11:45] study sessions into three parts now when
[00:11:48] I say a long study session I think
[00:11:51] anything more than three or four hours
[00:11:54] I'd say is a long study session but it's
[00:11:56] kind of relative like if you're studying
[00:11:58] three to four hours every single day and
[00:12:00] then your long session is like a seven
[00:12:02] hour block on a weekend then you could
[00:12:04] call that your long study session the
[00:12:06] first part is targeted review the second
[00:12:08] part is consolidation and preparation
[00:12:12] and the third part is preview in the
[00:12:15] second part which is consolidation and
[00:12:17] preparation we're going to be covering
[00:12:18] all the material that we've learned
[00:12:21] since our previous long study session so
[00:12:23] that could have been maybe a few days
[00:12:25] ago or even a whole week ago during this
[00:12:27] time you're gonna review your material
[00:12:28] you're gonna write your notes this is
[00:12:30] kind of like the main what we'd normally
[00:12:31] think of as yours normal study time and
[00:12:34] if possible I'd recommend that you use
[00:12:36] an efficient method for encoding that is
[00:12:38] non-linear and multi-order and if you
[00:12:41] don't know how to do that then I'd
[00:12:42] really recommend checking out my video
[00:12:43] on how I studied for my masters where I
[00:12:45] literally show you exactly how I did it
[00:12:49] now of course as I always talk about the
[00:12:50] quality of your encoding makes a big
[00:12:52] difference to how much you forget and
[00:12:53] the quality of your knowledge it's not
[00:12:55] something that you can just pick up and
[00:12:57] learn in 30 seconds I'm gonna teach you
[00:12:59] the principles I teach you the
[00:13:00] techniques and my other videos all the
[00:13:01] time you have to actually practice it so
[00:13:05] if you're sitting there watching this
[00:13:06] thinking that you can get good at this
[00:13:08] or know how to do it just by watching
[00:13:09] videos
[00:13:10] that's not gonna happen Okay like it's a
[00:13:13] skill it's not just a theory you have to
[00:13:15] actually put in the practice anyway
[00:13:17] while you're going through the material
[00:13:19] and you're encoding it you're actually
[00:13:21] filtering out the information so the
[00:13:24] stuff that you feel like you can encode
[00:13:25] you're going to encode it with whatever
[00:13:26] method that you're using and the stuff
[00:13:28] that you feel like you're going to
[00:13:29] forget even by using that method or it
[00:13:31] just doesn't fit that's the stuff that
[00:13:33] goes into your flashcards it's already
[00:13:35] different because a lot of people will
[00:13:37] just dump absolutely everything onto
[00:13:38] their flashcards and again that's kind
[00:13:40] of as soon as you do that you're
[00:13:42] fighting a losing battle at first the
[00:13:43] flashcards you make are going to be
[00:13:45] simple just direct recall or facts and
[00:13:47] Concepts just kind of the normal way
[00:13:49] that you use flashcards and if you again
[00:13:51] have an effective method of encoding
[00:13:52] then you should have already less flash
[00:13:54] cards than before because you'll have
[00:13:56] less things to just straight up memorize
[00:13:58] but here is where things get interesting
[00:14:00] throughout the week in these little
[00:14:02] pockets of time you're going to continue
[00:14:03] to do your flash cards and you should
[00:14:06] reasonably be able to get through around
[00:14:07] about 100 to 150 flash cards per week
[00:14:10] just through these random little pockets
[00:14:12] of time and if you've got more than that
[00:14:13] then that probably indicates that your
[00:14:15] method of encoding is actually holding
[00:14:16] you back instead so that's the trigger
[00:14:19] for you to go check out my videos on
[00:14:20] coding as you you go throughout the week
[00:14:23] and you're completing the flash cards
[00:14:25] you need to Mark the ones that you got
[00:14:27] correct three times in a row we want to
[00:14:30] come back to these later most apps have
[00:14:32] some kind of like star or flag or some
[00:14:35] kind of way to kind of just note that
[00:14:37] flash card we're gonna want to be able
[00:14:39] to find all of the ones that we got
[00:14:40] correct three times in a row likewise if
[00:14:43] you get a flashcard incorrect three
[00:14:45] times in a row we also want to flag that
[00:14:48] one too flag it something different so
[00:14:49] you can tell the two apart now in your
[00:14:51] next long study session which is a few
[00:14:53] days or a week later we're gonna have a
[00:14:56] list of flash cards that we got correct
[00:14:58] three times in a row and a list of flash
[00:15:00] cards that we got incorrect three times
[00:15:02] in a row and at the beginning of this
[00:15:04] long study session we're gonna do our
[00:15:06] targeted review start with the
[00:15:09] flashcards you got wrong three times in
[00:15:11] a row the chances are these flash cards
[00:15:13] are going to continue to be a problem
[00:15:14] for you and so it's not worth it to just
[00:15:17] leave it inside your flashcard deck and
[00:15:18] continue to just repeat them again and
[00:15:20] again sometimes you're getting right so
[00:15:21] sometimes getting it wrong it's just
[00:15:23] going to clog up your system it's
[00:15:24] worthwhile to just spend a little bit
[00:15:26] more time to really consolidate the
[00:15:28] knowledge in those cards so that you
[00:15:30] reduce the chances of you forgetting
[00:15:31] them for each of these cards spend five
[00:15:33] to ten minutes per card to go a little
[00:15:36] bit deeper and to try to connect that
[00:15:40] factor concept with your prior existing
[00:15:42] knowledge or other parts of the topic or
[00:15:45] create analogies we're going to try to
[00:15:47] build more of a network around this it
[00:15:49] doesn't matter if you can't get through
[00:15:50] all of your incorrect list if you
[00:15:53] dedicate a part of your study sessions
[00:15:55] every time to doing this you're just
[00:15:57] going to help reduce that flash card
[00:15:59] burden over time now if you do this and
[00:16:01] then you still get those flashcards
[00:16:04] wrong then you just do the same process
[00:16:06] again but this time you go even deeper
[00:16:08] and you build even more connections and
[00:16:09] and create even more of a network around
[00:16:11] it this often does mean that you'll have
[00:16:13] to go a little bit out of scope of the
[00:16:14] topic but honestly it's fine the time it
[00:16:17] takes to go out of scope but hold on to
[00:16:19] that piece of information is just going
[00:16:20] to be worth it you might also find when
[00:16:22] you do this that you look at this card
[00:16:23] and you think you know what I don't even
[00:16:24] really need to know this which would be
[00:16:27] great because then you can just remove
[00:16:28] it from your system and you don't have
[00:16:30] to worry about it again the more things
[00:16:31] you can get rid of the better it is for
[00:16:32] the cards you got correct three times in
[00:16:35] a row we're gonna go through those and
[00:16:38] merge and upgrade them we already
[00:16:40] remember the basic facts so let's
[00:16:42] challenge ourselves with a higher level
[00:16:44] take a look at all the facts and
[00:16:46] Concepts that you got in that correct
[00:16:48] list of cards and start thinking how
[00:16:50] some of these cards might be related to
[00:16:53] each other or influence each other when
[00:16:55] you see that some of these things might
[00:16:56] be connected we're going to combine them
[00:16:59] to create a higher order question
[00:17:00] instead for example if you've got two
[00:17:02] flashcards correct and one of them said
[00:17:03] how does protein synthesis work and the
[00:17:05] other one said how are hormones received
[00:17:07] by cell receptors then you could fuse
[00:17:09] the two of them together to create a
[00:17:11] question that's like how do hormones
[00:17:12] influence protein synthesis so this new
[00:17:15] card is actually testing on the same
[00:17:16] basic facts as the original but now
[00:17:19] we're also testing on the relationships
[00:17:21] and info influences that they have on
[00:17:23] each other so there are multiple
[00:17:24] benefits of doing this number one it
[00:17:25] just reduces the number of flash cards
[00:17:27] you've got to deal with number two it
[00:17:28] forces you to think about relationships
[00:17:30] and builds networks and number three it
[00:17:33] builds on your existing knowledge and
[00:17:35] what I mean by that is that when you
[00:17:36] have this kind of mega flash card that's
[00:17:38] a combination of multiple other ones you
[00:17:40] already know that you've got Mastery
[00:17:42] over the foundational information so
[00:17:43] when you test yourself on that it's
[00:17:45] unlikely that you're going to get like
[00:17:46] 80 of it right every single time and
[00:17:48] then just 20 of it consistently wrong
[00:17:49] and because the flash cards are
[00:17:51] constantly merging and changing as your
[00:17:54] Mastery grows you're not going to get to
[00:17:56] that point where you're just so
[00:17:57] repetitive on it that you're just
[00:17:59] memorizing oh neither flash card and
[00:18:01] then as you go your flash cards should
[00:18:03] continue to just converge and get
[00:18:05] upgraded now it does take a little bit
[00:18:07] of time to set all of this up and use
[00:18:09] this process but first of all it pays
[00:18:11] itself off in efficiency gains across
[00:18:13] really just like one or two weeks but
[00:18:15] also it's probably faster to answer each
[00:18:18] of these questions because it's
[00:18:19] constantly building on what you already
[00:18:21] know and creating these challenging
[00:18:23] questions is much easier when you've got
[00:18:25] that filtered list to work with and you
[00:18:27] know you can just see exactly how they
[00:18:29] could come together it's easier than
[00:18:30] just trying to do it from scratch so
[00:18:32] these two steps which is the reviewing
[00:18:34] your incorrect ones and going deeper and
[00:18:36] then reviewing your correct ones to fuse
[00:18:38] and take them higher this is part one
[00:18:42] targeted review and then in part two
[00:18:45] we're going to go through our new
[00:18:47] material which is where we're you know
[00:18:48] encoding even more and then obviously
[00:18:50] we're creating even more flashcards to
[00:18:52] work with for the week to come and then
[00:18:54] part three is the preview preview is
[00:18:57] when you're priming yourself in the
[00:18:58] material that you haven't really covered
[00:19:00] yet is one of the most important parts
[00:19:02] of studying if you had to choose between
[00:19:04] only doing review versus only doing the
[00:19:06] preview I would always say go for
[00:19:09] preview because it's the thing that's
[00:19:11] going to stop you from Forgetting so
[00:19:12] much in the first place it makes
[00:19:13] everything easier from that point
[00:19:15] onwards you can always catch up on
[00:19:17] review if you start falling behind but
[00:19:19] if you don't do the preview then you
[00:19:21] you're just constantly going to be
[00:19:23] falling behind because you're just going
[00:19:24] to forget so much preview is ultimately
[00:19:26] what stops you from getting overwhelmed
[00:19:28] so by following the strategy you will
[00:19:30] find that your flashcards become more
[00:19:32] challenging but in a good way they're a
[00:19:34] lot more engaging and enjoyable it helps
[00:19:36] you to prepare for your exams a lot more
[00:19:37] comprehensively it makes flash cards
[00:19:39] less overwhelming and overall improves
[00:19:41] your attention so there are some parts
[00:19:43] that I haven't had time to go through in
[00:19:45] this video like for example in part two
[00:19:46] when you're doing the encoding if you
[00:19:48] want to learn how to do that a little
[00:19:49] bit better then I'd recommend checking
[00:19:51] out my video on how I study for my
[00:19:53] masters where you can see a
[00:19:54] demonstration of it or part three which
[00:19:55] is a preview which I've said is so
[00:19:57] important I'd recommend that you'd start
[00:19:59] with watching this video and how I
[00:20:00] ranked first at Monash University where
[00:20:02] I talk about the system or preview that
[00:20:04] I use that's a good place to start or if
[00:20:06] you're wanting a single place to start
[00:20:07] with all of my videos where you can
[00:20:08] learn all the fundamentals step by step
[00:20:10] then have a look at this playlist that
[00:20:12] we've created for you as well as usual
[00:20:14] thank you so much for watching and I'll
[00:20:16] see you next time
[00:20:21] [Music]
[00:20:29] thank you


=== The BIGGEST problem with flashcards ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVzNUz5Nsg8

[00:00:00] what are flash cards not good at well
[00:00:02] even though flash cards trigger active
[00:00:04] retrieval of knowledge the way you
[00:00:06] retrieve the knowledge makes a big
[00:00:08] difference flash card apps are generally
[00:00:09] designed to test you on a one: one ratio
[00:00:12] what that means is that you get one
[00:00:14] prompter question that tests you on one
[00:00:16] concept or fact and this is good for
[00:00:18] direct fact recall and memorization but
[00:00:20] it's not as helpful for the higher order
[00:00:22] learning needs where you actually need
[00:00:24] to draw on multiple Concepts and facts
[00:00:26] and how they influence and relate to
[00:00:28] each other


=== 3 ways that flashcards can be useful ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTAFPSxFDkQ

[00:00:00] if your system of learning does depend
[00:00:02] on Space repetition then there are some
[00:00:05] serious problems with it but it doesn't
[00:00:07] mean that flash cards do not have its
[00:00:10] place flashcards are useful for three
[00:00:12] main reasons firstly it triggers active
[00:00:15] retrieval of knowledge which has well
[00:00:16] proven benefits on your memory and
[00:00:18] retention secondly it makes it very easy
[00:00:20] to space your repetitions out and it
[00:00:22] allows you to repeat stuff not at a
[00:00:24] topic or subject level but at a fact or
[00:00:26] at a concept level and lastly it helps
[00:00:29] with something called micro learning
[00:00:31] micro learning is when you have these
[00:00:33] study sessions that are very
[00:00:34] concentrated and short bursts of time
[00:00:36] like only a few minutes long


=== Stop trying to optimise your schedule ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH3VZ6F-zwY

[00:00:00] so people will often send me their
[00:00:01] schedule like a Google Calendar
[00:00:02] screenshot and say hey Justin is there
[00:00:04] anything wrong with my schedule the
[00:00:05] thing is that it's actually completely
[00:00:06] meaningless to see that because what's
[00:00:08] important is not what's on the schedule
[00:00:09] what's important is what's executed and
[00:00:11] what's important is the subjective
[00:00:12] experience of trying to follow that
[00:00:14] schedule so you can have the best
[00:00:15] schedule that's there that's you know
[00:00:16] perfect for everything it takes all the
[00:00:18] schedule boxes but it can be completely
[00:00:19] useless overall and absolutely redundant
[00:00:21] and that's why I now teach mostly about
[00:00:24] getting really really good with task
[00:00:26] management and I would say I'm a fairly
[00:00:28] busy person however I don't spend much
[00:00:30] of my effort or mental energy on the
[00:00:33] scheduling aspect at all if people see
[00:00:35] my calendar they'll probably be
[00:00:36] surprised at how it's not as packed as
[00:00:38] you might expect it to be


=== The best way to learn a new skill. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDexxuLC1hs

[00:00:00] expect to fail to begin with this is
[00:00:02] different from saying like failure is
[00:00:04] necessary or whatever it is like
[00:00:05] deliberately expect to fail expect to
[00:00:07] succeed on the 20th don't try to even
[00:00:09] succeed on the first few because it
[00:00:11] feels so easy to fix it in just one or
[00:00:14] two goes you probably would have already
[00:00:15] fixed it anything that's complicated
[00:00:16] enough for you to engage in this process
[00:00:18] of deliberate Improvement is probably
[00:00:20] not something that's going to be easily
[00:00:21] fixed after the first 5 to 20 attempts


=== Ask yourself this question ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QCTYG8OBuo

[00:00:00] the question you have to ask yourself is
[00:00:01] is there someone else out there maybe
[00:00:03] not even out there maybe just like
[00:00:05] literally in your classroom is there
[00:00:07] someone else that isn't having that
[00:00:08] problem that you're having is there
[00:00:09] someone else that sat down today in a
[00:00:11] similar circumstance and did have a
[00:00:13] great study session is there someone
[00:00:14] else that maybe I studied with a friend
[00:00:16] maybe they had a great session is there
[00:00:17] someone that is finding this topic
[00:00:19] easier to understand is this someone
[00:00:20] that isn't so bothered by the fact that
[00:00:22] this teacher seems to be you know a
[00:00:23] terrible teacher right if the answer is
[00:00:25] yes we can replicate that it's not just
[00:00:27] the way that it is it's just the way
[00:00:29] you're doing something so that's what
[00:00:30] critical reflection is about it's about
[00:00:32] figuring out what are the things that we
[00:00:33] can change and experiment on to start
[00:00:36] modifying the way that we're approaching
[00:00:38] things to actually fix problems at their
[00:00:40] root cause rather than always just
[00:00:42] trying to deal with the symptoms


=== How to prepare for ANY exam question ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Mpe1mtYFGo

[00:00:00] you know how there are different ways
[00:00:01] that you can be tested you can get a
[00:00:03] very direct fact recall kind of question
[00:00:05] for example name the parts of this
[00:00:08] animal cell but you can also get a
[00:00:09] question that's like this medication
[00:00:11] affects the cell's TRNA function in this
[00:00:14] way what is the potential impact it
[00:00:16] could have on protein synthesis so you
[00:00:18] can see it's a lot more interconnected
[00:00:20] so if you make sure that the methods
[00:00:22] that you're using to study are aligned
[00:00:24] with the different types of ways that
[00:00:26] you need to retrieve that knowledge for
[00:00:28] example if you need to retrieve the
[00:00:30] knowledge in these interconnected ways
[00:00:31] using a non-linear relational method of
[00:00:35] studying and then you can pad up and
[00:00:37] supplement that with direct Factor
[00:00:39] recall isolated methods for example like
[00:00:41] flash cards then you'd have a robust and
[00:00:44] comprehensive study system that means
[00:00:46] that when you're studying the type of
[00:00:48] knowledge that you're developing is
[00:00:50] going to be high quality and as a result
[00:00:52] you'll be able to use that knowledge in
[00:00:55] the right way for whatever your needs
[00:00:57] are


=== Comfort is the enemy of TRUE change ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSx_iT1Y8Y

[00:00:00] most people learn a certain way because
[00:00:01] they just picked it up from their
[00:00:03] friends or it's just a habit of learning
[00:00:05] that they picked up over time and a lot
[00:00:06] of people feel very insecure about
[00:00:08] changing their methods and so as a
[00:00:10] result they choose Comfort let me give
[00:00:12] you an example one of my students is
[00:00:14] finishing their second year of medical
[00:00:16] school at King's College London and they
[00:00:18] started off studying four or five hours
[00:00:21] a day but we found that a lot of the
[00:00:22] time the issue of spending was wasted
[00:00:25] there was a lot of inefficient methods
[00:00:26] being used so she actually ended up
[00:00:28] joining my program and after a whole
[00:00:29] year she was like the techniques aren't
[00:00:30] working I'm not getting any better and
[00:00:32] it turns out that for the whole year she
[00:00:35] had been so afraid of making any real
[00:00:38] and meaningful changes to her methods
[00:00:41] that she had never even tried practicing
[00:00:44] the techniques for more than a few hours
[00:00:46] by choosing comfort and doubling down on
[00:00:48] methods that weren't working for her she
[00:00:51] managed to spend the whole year on
[00:00:54] trying to improve without actually ever
[00:00:57] improving


=== 4 Ways to Ruin Your Studying Efficiency ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4_j2VggToM

[00:00:00] are you sick and tired of being Elite do
[00:00:03] you wish you could spend more time
[00:00:05] studying and remember less are you
[00:00:08] looking to feel overwhelmed with more
[00:00:11] content look no further in this video
[00:00:13] I'm gonna tell you four ways that you
[00:00:16] can absolutely ruin your learning
[00:00:18] efficiency and for some of you you may
[00:00:21] already even be doing some of these make
[00:00:23] sure to stick around to the end because
[00:00:24] number four is my personal favorite way
[00:00:26] to learn absolutely nothing even if I
[00:00:29] study for hours if you're new to the
[00:00:31] channel welcome I'm Dr Justin sung I'm a
[00:00:33] learning coach learning researcher and
[00:00:34] head of learning at I can study I'm a
[00:00:36] former medical doctor and for the last
[00:00:37] decade I have worked with tens of
[00:00:39] thousands of people to teach them to
[00:00:41] learn more efficiently which also means
[00:00:44] that I have a lot of experience seeing
[00:00:48] how people can work inefficiently before
[00:00:50] we jump in I'd appreciate if you give
[00:00:52] this video a like it really does help
[00:00:53] with the YouTube algorithm so coming in
[00:00:55] at number one make sure the way you
[00:00:57] study is completely relevant what does
[00:01:01] this mean you know how there are
[00:01:02] different ways that you can be tested
[00:01:04] for example you can get a very direct
[00:01:06] fact recall kind of question for example
[00:01:08] name the parts of this animal cell but
[00:01:11] you can also get a question that's like
[00:01:12] this medication affects the cell's TRNA
[00:01:15] function in this way what is the
[00:01:18] potential impact it could have on
[00:01:19] protein synthesis so you can see it's a
[00:01:21] lot more interconnected it requires us
[00:01:23] to draw on lots of different concepts
[00:01:25] and how they influence each other it's
[00:01:26] different from just like an isolated
[00:01:28] factorical there's different types of
[00:01:30] knowledge even in the workplace that's
[00:01:31] exactly the same we might have problems
[00:01:33] that we're trying to solve that's like
[00:01:34] what's the process for cleaning this
[00:01:36] data set again versus using your
[00:01:39] knowledge in a really interconnected way
[00:01:40] like if the data set is this small then
[00:01:45] what are still some relevant analyzes
[00:01:47] that I can do that give me an insight
[00:01:49] into the businesses recent performance
[00:01:51] so you can see that the latter requires
[00:01:53] a lot more of that high level synthesis
[00:01:55] drawing on your understanding of lots of
[00:01:57] different concepts so if you make sure
[00:01:59] that the methods that you're using to
[00:02:01] study are aligned with the different
[00:02:03] types of ways that you need to retrieve
[00:02:05] that knowledge for example if you need
[00:02:07] to retrieve the knowledge in these
[00:02:08] interconnected ways using a non-linear
[00:02:11] relational method of studying that
[00:02:13] allows you to see the big picture and
[00:02:15] the connections and figure out the
[00:02:17] influence and relationship between them
[00:02:18] and then you can pad up and supplement
[00:02:21] that with direct Factor recall isolated
[00:02:24] methods for example like flashcards if
[00:02:26] you do that then you'd have a robust and
[00:02:29] comprehensive study system that means
[00:02:31] that when you are studying the type of
[00:02:33] knowledge that you're developing is
[00:02:34] going to be high quality and as a result
[00:02:36] you'll be able to use that knowledge in
[00:02:39] the right way for whatever your needs
[00:02:41] are but obviously if you do that then
[00:02:43] you're running into the risk where you
[00:02:45] might actually spend a lot of time
[00:02:46] studying and then you'd actually also
[00:02:48] learn a lot too which we don't want that
[00:02:52] now so we have to make sure that we
[00:02:54] don't do that instead make sure that
[00:02:56] your methods of studying are just purely
[00:02:59] memorization and isolated fact recall
[00:03:02] don't think at all about how you need to
[00:03:05] use knowledge in different ways and how
[00:03:07] the method of studying might actually
[00:03:08] influence that so make sure you're
[00:03:10] wasting as much time as possible you
[00:03:12] have to make sure that the methods
[00:03:13] you're using are as irrelevant to the
[00:03:16] way you need to use your knowledge as
[00:03:18] possible something that you definitely
[00:03:19] should do is you really should like this
[00:03:23] video
[00:03:25] secondly as time is precious and like
[00:03:29] we've already talked about it's
[00:03:30] important that you waste as much of that
[00:03:32] time as possible one great way to waste
[00:03:35] hours and hours of time in fact like
[00:03:37] almost all of the time that you've spent
[00:03:39] studying is to make sure that you learn
[00:03:40] the wrong thing in the wrong way this
[00:03:43] one's a little bit more complicated so
[00:03:45] let me explain the human brain builds
[00:03:47] knowledge and memory in a very specific
[00:03:49] way
[00:03:50] we all start off with a set of prior
[00:03:52] knowledge either from previously
[00:03:54] studying the topic or just general
[00:03:56] knowledge you may have picked up
[00:03:57] throughout life now when new information
[00:04:00] enters into the brain then our brain
[00:04:03] tries to see how it's related to what we
[00:04:06] already know when that new information
[00:04:08] is related to a lot of our existing
[00:04:11] knowledge then our brain knows how to
[00:04:14] think about it it's more easily
[00:04:16] integrated and Consolidated which is
[00:04:18] what forms a stronger more robust memory
[00:04:21] and because it's connected to lots of
[00:04:24] other things we can use that knowledge
[00:04:26] in many different ways it's kind of like
[00:04:28] a town that is connected by lots of
[00:04:30] different highways versus let's say a
[00:04:32] town that you can only reach you know by
[00:04:34] boat because it's on an island now the
[00:04:36] thing is though that when we're learning
[00:04:37] things in the normal kind of real world
[00:04:39] we can't really control all the time
[00:04:41] whether the information that we're
[00:04:43] learning is going to be relevant or not
[00:04:44] and especially this is the case in
[00:04:46] formal education where the information
[00:04:48] is actually being fed to you in a very
[00:04:49] specific order and this could be reading
[00:04:52] it through a book or it could be someone
[00:04:54] speaking to you but the idea is that new
[00:04:56] information is actually scattered all
[00:04:58] around and that information isn't always
[00:05:02] going to be something that your brain
[00:05:03] finds relevant it's not always going to
[00:05:04] see that there's lots of different
[00:05:05] connections and so in order to make sure
[00:05:07] that the time that we spend studying
[00:05:09] creates the highest quality memory and
[00:05:11] depth of understanding possible what we
[00:05:13] need to do is we need to scan through
[00:05:15] the material to pick out the parts that
[00:05:17] our brain would find the most relevant
[00:05:19] in other words what in the new
[00:05:21] information feels like it is the most
[00:05:23] related to and connected to what you
[00:05:25] already know and that could be a lot or
[00:05:28] it could be very little but by starting
[00:05:30] in this way we're able to extract out
[00:05:32] new parts of information maybe not at
[00:05:35] the same usually actually not in the
[00:05:37] same order as what's given to us and
[00:05:40] then as we do that our knowledge is
[00:05:42] going to grow and grow and grow and that
[00:05:45] means that as we learn more new
[00:05:47] information we have more and more more
[00:05:51] points of reference so for example if
[00:05:53] this piece of information was new and
[00:05:56] previously it would have had nothing to
[00:05:57] really connect to well now that we've
[00:05:59] got a better Foundation we can actually
[00:06:01] form some new connections with it that
[00:06:03] we might not have been able to do one or
[00:06:05] two hours ago and this is the benefit of
[00:06:08] going by relevance when you start with
[00:06:10] what your brain feels like it's better
[00:06:12] at holding on to and what feels more
[00:06:14] relevant it allows you to build
[00:06:16] relevance on top of relevance and as we
[00:06:19] learn it starts to make more and more
[00:06:22] sense it's actually getting
[00:06:23] progressively easier to deal with it's
[00:06:26] kind of like completing a jigsaw puzzle
[00:06:27] when you start with a jigsaw puzzle if
[00:06:29] you just start from like a random part
[00:06:31] of the middle that looks the same as any
[00:06:33] other part of the puzzle it's actually
[00:06:34] really hard to solve it because you have
[00:06:35] to dig through all the you know hundreds
[00:06:37] of different pieces to find the right
[00:06:38] one what you should do is just to start
[00:06:40] with the edge pieces the one that's got
[00:06:42] a flat Edge on one side and then as you
[00:06:44] complete the edge pieces then you start
[00:06:47] getting more to work with and you can
[00:06:49] fill in from the edge edges towards the
[00:06:52] middle and this means that as you go it
[00:06:54] gets easier and easier because you're
[00:06:56] building that bigger picture and also
[00:06:59] because there's more stuff that's
[00:07:00] Consolidated there's less pieces in the
[00:07:03] Box for you to scatter through to figure
[00:07:04] out how to make sense of it all it
[00:07:06] becomes more a matter of finding the
[00:07:08] right thing and just fitting it into the
[00:07:10] Gap that is still in your puzzle so if
[00:07:12] you're controlling the order in which
[00:07:13] you are learning the information based
[00:07:14] on relevance and this is a method that I
[00:07:16] call order control then this means that
[00:07:19] you have a very very high chance of
[00:07:22] learning a lot and having really great
[00:07:25] depths of understanding as well as
[00:07:26] really high quality memory after a
[00:07:28] single study session which would be
[00:07:30] terrible in this case so to avoid doing
[00:07:33] that we need to make sure that we are
[00:07:35] learning things in just the same order
[00:07:38] as what was given to us and we're never
[00:07:40] really thinking about whether it's
[00:07:41] relevant or not and we're never really
[00:07:43] looking for things that are more
[00:07:45] relevant instead what we should do is
[00:07:46] just take each piece of information one
[00:07:49] by one try to memorize and completely
[00:07:51] understand each individual piece of
[00:07:53] information so that one day hopefully we
[00:07:56] form that big picture it would be kind
[00:07:58] of like trying to serve a jigsaw puzzle
[00:08:00] by just staring at a box full of pieces
[00:08:04] and then individually try to memorize
[00:08:06] each piece until somehow you can
[00:08:08] magically see how it all fits together
[00:08:10] and forms the bigger picture
[00:08:14] which is incredibly inefficient and
[00:08:17] maybe even impossible
[00:08:20] perfect but what's even better is that
[00:08:22] if we do that then our brain is going to
[00:08:23] have no idea what to do with all of
[00:08:25] these individual isolated pieces of
[00:08:27] information and so it's not going to
[00:08:28] hold on to it very strongly either for
[00:08:31] example if you're trying to memorize
[00:08:32] each individual jigsaw piece one by one
[00:08:34] then you probably get through five or
[00:08:36] six pieces before you start forgetting
[00:08:37] what the first one looked like and so in
[00:08:40] that case you now need to spend more
[00:08:42] time to go back and relearn the stuff
[00:08:44] that you already covered but now you're
[00:08:45] forgotten and in doing so you create a
[00:08:48] never-ending backlog of things for you
[00:08:50] to constantly repeatedly learn because
[00:08:52] you didn't learn it the right way the
[00:08:54] first time and by doing that we can
[00:08:55] waste even more time and as long as
[00:08:58] every time we're trying to relearn
[00:08:59] something that we forgot we're just
[00:09:01] relearning it in the same way that we
[00:09:03] learned it the first time then we can
[00:09:05] guarantee that we're going to forget
[00:09:07] like half of it again so we never really
[00:09:10] able to get on top of the material that
[00:09:12] we're constantly forgetting so if you
[00:09:15] wanted to be really overwhelmed with
[00:09:17] work all the time and as you study more
[00:09:20] and more it just gets harder and more
[00:09:22] overwhelming then this is going to be
[00:09:23] perfect for you thirdly and this is
[00:09:25] critical we have to never actually
[00:09:27] improve every year of Our Lives
[00:09:30] challenges are just going to get
[00:09:32] continually harder so imagine if your
[00:09:35] abilities and skills grew faster in the
[00:09:39] challenges got harder imagine how
[00:09:41] efficient you would become if every week
[00:09:43] you're getting 5 or 10 watts even one
[00:09:46] percent more efficient than you are now
[00:09:48] yes it may not be enough for an
[00:09:50] immediate short-term goal like in the
[00:09:52] next few months but over time your
[00:09:55] ability to handle challenges would grow
[00:09:58] massively and we can't have that
[00:10:00] happening so to make sure that we never
[00:10:02] really improve or grow we have to always
[00:10:05] choose Comfort the key components to
[00:10:08] growth and self-development is
[00:10:10] self-awareness and critical reflection
[00:10:12] which sound like kind of fluffy words
[00:10:14] but it's actually very logical it just
[00:10:15] means that we know what we are doing why
[00:10:18] we are doing it and whether we think
[00:10:20] it's working or not for example most
[00:10:22] people learn a certain way because they
[00:10:25] just picked it up from their friends or
[00:10:26] it's just a habit of learning that they
[00:10:28] picked up over time and a lot of people
[00:10:29] feel very insecure about changing their
[00:10:32] methods and so as a result they choose
[00:10:34] Comfort let me give you an example one
[00:10:36] of my students is finishing their second
[00:10:37] year of medical school at King's College
[00:10:39] London and they started off studying
[00:10:42] four or five hours a day but we found
[00:10:44] that a lot of the time the issue of
[00:10:46] spending was wasted there was a lot of
[00:10:48] inefficient methods being used she was
[00:10:50] relearning a lot of what she'd already
[00:10:52] forgotten in fact of the four or five
[00:10:54] hours a day of studying like three or
[00:10:56] four of those hours were spent on just
[00:10:58] kind of re-learning and recapping the
[00:11:00] stuff that she had already covered
[00:11:01] before and also the myth is that she was
[00:11:03] using was not really a line and so even
[00:11:06] though she was studying it she wasn't
[00:11:07] really able to use the knowledge very
[00:11:09] well for her needs either she'd kind of
[00:11:11] resigned herself to the fact that there
[00:11:13] are some difficult curvier questions in
[00:11:15] the exam that are going to come up that
[00:11:17] she's just not going to be able to
[00:11:18] answer so she actually ended up joining
[00:11:19] my programming and after a whole year
[00:11:21] she sent me this big long email and she
[00:11:23] was like the techniques aren't working
[00:11:24] I'm not getting any better I'm my
[00:11:26] results aren't any better and she was
[00:11:27] getting really stressed out because she
[00:11:28] was about to enter into her second year
[00:11:29] which is you know even harder so I
[00:11:31] jumped on a call with her to see what
[00:11:32] was going on and it turns out that for
[00:11:34] the whole year she had been so afraid of
[00:11:38] making any real and meaningful changes
[00:11:41] to her methods because you know just in
[00:11:43] case she screws up that she had never
[00:11:45] even tried practicing the techniques for
[00:11:48] more than a few hours she had
[00:11:50] effectively spent her whole year just
[00:11:52] dipping her toes
[00:11:53] in and out rather than starting with
[00:11:57] dipping her toes and then eventually
[00:11:59] kind of like submerging herself more and
[00:12:01] more and so for her the comfort of
[00:12:03] holding on to and keeping with her
[00:12:05] current methods and habits was well
[00:12:08] worthwhile then the discomfort
[00:12:11] associated with making a change so
[00:12:13] here's the learning point from the story
[00:12:15] is that instead of actually challenging
[00:12:17] ourselves and asking ourselves is this
[00:12:20] really working or do I just want to
[00:12:23] believe that it's working because if
[00:12:24] it's not that means that there's too
[00:12:26] much uncertainty and discomfort
[00:12:28] associated with accepting it and then
[00:12:29] having to make a change instead of
[00:12:31] asking ourselves that by choosing
[00:12:33] Comfort instead of making changes we can
[00:12:36] guarantee that nothing will change and
[00:12:39] so will never improve by choosing
[00:12:40] comfort and doubling down on methods
[00:12:42] that weren't working for her she managed
[00:12:45] to spend the whole year on trying to
[00:12:49] improve without actually ever improving
[00:12:51] now unfortunately that was was a year
[00:12:54] ago and then I had that call in the
[00:12:56] meeting with her and I sort of told her
[00:12:57] you know this is what's going on and
[00:12:59] then she decided to really commit
[00:13:00] herself and so now apparently in her
[00:13:02] recent email she said that she's down to
[00:13:04] studying only two or three hours a day
[00:13:06] so you know that's unfortunate it's
[00:13:08] really amazing how much people can
[00:13:09] change when they stay open-minded and
[00:13:12] commit to making wild thought out
[00:13:14] strategic decisions so yeah we can't
[00:13:16] have that no but that doesn't have to be
[00:13:18] you as long as you follow the tips in
[00:13:20] this video don't worry I promise you
[00:13:22] will not improve finally number four my
[00:13:25] favorite way to learn absolutely nothing
[00:13:28] even if my eyes bleed from studying so
[00:13:31] much measure your learning success with
[00:13:35] metrics that mean nothing a metric is
[00:13:38] something that you use to measure
[00:13:40] something else for example a metric for
[00:13:42] how fast your traveling might be
[00:13:43] kilometers an hour a metric for how well
[00:13:47] a YouTube video is performing could be
[00:13:49] views or likes and metrics really matter
[00:13:52] because it tells us what we care about
[00:13:55] it gives us insight into the problem
[00:13:57] back when I was still working as a
[00:13:59] doctor one of the things that I hated
[00:14:00] was that there weren't any metrics on
[00:14:03] the doctor's well-being or their job
[00:14:05] satisfaction or the efficiency of the
[00:14:08] system the hospital management didn't
[00:14:10] really care and if there were any
[00:14:11] problems they would never know because
[00:14:12] they're not measuring it so no matter
[00:14:15] how bad things got there was probably
[00:14:18] not any action that was gonna arise out
[00:14:20] of it because the problem doesn't exist
[00:14:23] and it's the same thing with learning
[00:14:25] that student from before she measured
[00:14:27] her success with learning based on how
[00:14:29] many notes she was able to write
[00:14:31] lectures for in a single day or the
[00:14:34] number of lectures she was able to cover
[00:14:35] should be really happy if she was able
[00:14:37] to cover five lectures in a single day
[00:14:40] or do four years worth of past papers
[00:14:43] but since learning is something that
[00:14:45] happens in our brain and that's where we
[00:14:47] need the knowledge not on Hafer those
[00:14:49] metrics are actually kind of meaningless
[00:14:51] how many no to be rain or how many
[00:14:53] lectures we cover are how many papers we
[00:14:55] do it doesn't actually tell us about the
[00:14:58] quality of the knowledge that's in our
[00:14:59] brain our brain's ability to hold on to
[00:15:01] it or use it in the way that we need to
[00:15:04] use it for example even if she was happy
[00:15:06] to cover five lectures in a day she
[00:15:09] didn't really think about the fact that
[00:15:10] she would be forgetting half of it a
[00:15:13] week later anyway so the total amount of
[00:15:15] time it would take for her to reach the
[00:15:17] level of knowledge that she actually
[00:15:19] needs at the retention level she
[00:15:21] actually needs was way longer than just
[00:15:23] a single study session but she wasn't
[00:15:25] measuring any of that so the problem
[00:15:27] didn't really exist and that's the key
[00:15:30] if you don't see the problem you never
[00:15:33] fix it even when she learned better
[00:15:36] techniques and better methods she wasn't
[00:15:39] willing to commit to it because of the
[00:15:41] fact that it might mean that Chief
[00:15:43] covers fewer lectures in a single study
[00:15:46] session even though her retention and
[00:15:48] quality of learning was higher and so it
[00:15:51] should be saving more time overall and
[00:15:54] even after she'd learned about how to
[00:15:55] measure learning more effectively she
[00:15:57] didn't actually apply that because it
[00:15:59] wasn't as convenient to measure as her
[00:16:02] normal ways of measuring things and
[00:16:03] that's how she managed to leave it for a
[00:16:05] whole year without even realizing what
[00:16:07] the problem was which led to her sending
[00:16:09] me a big long email like everything is
[00:16:10] broken nothing is working and then I
[00:16:12] looked at it and I was like
[00:16:14] that's not where the problem is so if
[00:16:17] you want to make sure that you are blind
[00:16:20] to any problems then make sure that you
[00:16:23] don't think about things too deeply do
[00:16:24] not measure things in a way that is
[00:16:27] Meaningful now you might be wondering
[00:16:28] how can I know if my metric makes a
[00:16:32] difference or not and a few good
[00:16:34] questions that you can ask yourself are
[00:16:35] is there someone that would do better
[00:16:38] than me even if they were to score lower
[00:16:41] on the metric so for example in a single
[00:16:43] study session is it possible that
[00:16:45] someone could study and cover less
[00:16:48] lectures than me but still perform
[00:16:50] better or you could even make it is it
[00:16:54] possible that this metric doesn't
[00:16:57] necessarily lead to success is it
[00:17:01] possible that the more flash cards I
[00:17:03] cover or the more past papers I do it
[00:17:06] doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to do
[00:17:09] well if the answer is yes then it
[00:17:12] probably means that the Metro trick that
[00:17:15] you're using is not going to make the
[00:17:18] biggest difference
[00:17:20] which is excellent now the reason that
[00:17:22] this is my personal favorite way to ruin
[00:17:25] your learning efficiency is because it's
[00:17:27] fundamental if you don't even see the
[00:17:30] problem in the first place you are not
[00:17:32] even ready to start improving which is
[00:17:35] one of the most efficient ways to
[00:17:39] Forever stay inefficient use all four of
[00:17:43] these methods and I guarantee you will
[00:17:46] struggle with learning your whole life

=== Hack your brain into remembering ANYTHING ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8UavinnqcQ

[00:00:00] the human brain builds knowledge and
[00:00:02] memory in a very specific way we all
[00:00:04] start off with a set of prior knowledge
[00:00:06] when new information enters into the
[00:00:10] brain then our brain tries to see how
[00:00:13] it's related to what we already know
[00:00:15] when that new information is related to
[00:00:18] a lot of our existing knowledge it's
[00:00:21] more easily integrated and Consolidated
[00:00:23] which is what forms a stronger more
[00:00:26] robust memory now the thing is though
[00:00:28] that we can't really control all the
[00:00:30] time whether the information that we're
[00:00:32] learning is going to be relevant or not
[00:00:33] new information is actually scattered
[00:00:35] all around all we need to do is we need
[00:00:38] to scan through the material to pick out
[00:00:40] the parts that our brain would find the
[00:00:42] most relevant and then as we do that our
[00:00:45] knowledge is going to grow and grow and
[00:00:48] grow and that means that as we learn
[00:00:50] more new information we have more and
[00:00:53] more points of reference and this is the
[00:00:56] benefit of doing by relevance


=== Most students have no idea what they are doing ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYqSGgo7XgQ

[00:00:00] and I'll ask students like what their
[00:00:02] goal is and they'll say oh you know they
[00:00:03] want to get like a top you know one
[00:00:04] percent grade or whatever it is and then
[00:00:06] we'll say well how confident are you in
[00:00:07] being able to achieve that you know how
[00:00:09] much would you be willing to bet on
[00:00:11] yourself and you know these are people
[00:00:12] like essentially going through school
[00:00:14] like coming up to their final exams and
[00:00:17] they are in a position where they're
[00:00:19] kind of making these decisions on where
[00:00:21] their career trajectory is going to go
[00:00:22] like this is one of those sort of Life
[00:00:24] level decisions or at least something
[00:00:25] that's going to affect them for the next
[00:00:26] three to five years the average value
[00:00:28] that people are willing to bet on
[00:00:30] themselves is like three cents it's like
[00:00:32] you know people like bit at most like 20
[00:00:34] bucks and most people are like betting
[00:00:35] negatives like they have so little
[00:00:37] confidence in their ability to achieve
[00:00:39] it and when you ask them why they don't
[00:00:41] have confidence is because they have no
[00:00:42] idea what they're doing they know that
[00:00:44] they have no idea what they're doing
[00:00:46] they know that they're essentially just
[00:00:47] crossing their fingers and just hoping
[00:00:49] for the best and just trying to overcome
[00:00:51] the idea that they don't know what
[00:00:52] they're doing through just pure effort
[00:00:54] alone


=== Spaced retrieval VS Spaced repetition ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfKQZqaQ5po

[00:00:00] space retrieval is the proper term it's
[00:00:01] retrieval practice it's retrieval it's
[00:00:03] you know the word is retrieval like
[00:00:05] that's ubiquitous in the mainstream
[00:00:07] space people just know that a space
[00:00:09] repetition I don't know where that
[00:00:10] originated from but people understand
[00:00:11] their space repetition so I call it
[00:00:13] space repetition when I talk about it in
[00:00:14] public if I do writing about it or if
[00:00:16] I'm publishing about it or if I'm
[00:00:17] talking to people that know about the
[00:00:19] science mind I call it space retrieval
[00:00:20] this is another aspect
[00:00:22] how research gets translated into
[00:00:24] practice is the language that people use
[00:00:26] a word that's used in the research
[00:00:27] Community to mean one thing can mean
[00:00:29] something else in in the practice
[00:00:31] Community words that get used in the in
[00:00:34] the research Community sometimes never
[00:00:36] actually make it out you can have two
[00:00:38] different words for the same exact thing
[00:00:40] everything that that can go wrong does
[00:00:42] go wrong


=== This is what most students get wrong ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYXwDZ90Bxc

[00:00:00] students that do better especially long
[00:00:02] term especially for bigger more
[00:00:03] challenging goals they're the ones that
[00:00:05] know that they can put aside time and do
[00:00:06] something without needing for it to
[00:00:09] always feel urgent if you always require
[00:00:11] something to feel urgent for you to do
[00:00:13] it there is no real situation where that
[00:00:14] is an advantage to you in life there's
[00:00:16] no possible situation where the
[00:00:18] necessity for your task execution
[00:00:20] relying on urgency is a good thing


=== How to avoid feeling overwhelmed doing Mindmaps ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex7bjPLNzWc

[00:00:00] we've got we've got Janelle and Sonia
[00:00:02] with us who are our guests and they're
[00:00:03] going to be sharing some of the
[00:00:04] struggles that they've had and I'm going
[00:00:06] to go through and dissect them I am uh I
[00:00:10] haven't really looked at any of their
[00:00:12] work I don't know what the concerns and
[00:00:14] issues really are yet um so I'll be
[00:00:18] going through it fresh you'll be able to
[00:00:19] see how I approach it and the the key
[00:00:23] learning and takeaway for you is not
[00:00:25] just to say h here's a couple random
[00:00:27] people and the problems that they face
[00:00:28] but also just to learn my Approach cuz
[00:00:31] my Approach for um tackling problems and
[00:00:36] uh solving learning or self-management
[00:00:37] related issues is usually pretty similar
[00:00:40] um even if the the the types of problems
[00:00:42] are quite diverse so there's there's a
[00:00:45] way that you can learn to approach your
[00:00:47] own problems and sort of diagnose and be
[00:00:49] the mechanic of your own brain like I
[00:00:50] always say so um without further Ado I
[00:00:53] will uh I think Janelle we'll just start
[00:00:57] with you I'm going to move you over to
[00:01:00] my screen here so everyone else can see
[00:01:03] you
[00:01:05] and yep so based on the chat it says
[00:01:08] everything looks good that's perfect so
[00:01:11] Janelle um would you mind just uh
[00:01:14] introducing yourself just letting me
[00:01:17] know uh you know where you're from what
[00:01:20] your you know what level of Education
[00:01:22] you're at and just a brief background in
[00:01:25] terms of like you know what are you
[00:01:26] studying and what are some of the issues
[00:01:28] that you are facing
[00:01:33] hello I'm Janelle I'm a second year bio
[00:01:36] student in
[00:01:37] Canada um I
[00:01:40] guess right now I'm very unsure what my
[00:01:44] problems are because I just changed my
[00:01:47] methods um throughout first year I
[00:01:50] mostly relied on anky practice problems
[00:01:53] that's basically what I would use a lot
[00:01:56] of
[00:01:57] anky and I thought that was like
[00:02:00] it worked a lot in the beginning I got
[00:02:02] really good midterm grades I'd get 90%
[00:02:05] almost 100 it'd be good but by the end
[00:02:07] of it I would Crash and Burn and i' do
[00:02:10] pretty bad on my finals just because I
[00:02:12] couldn't study anymore so that's why I'm
[00:02:15] changing and I kind of moved on to like
[00:02:18] mind maps and higher order thinking but
[00:02:20] I'm struggling a lot with that okay so
[00:02:23] we we'll definitely um jump into that a
[00:02:24] little bit more can you tell me a little
[00:02:25] bit more like you said that it it made
[00:02:27] you kind of Crash when you were just
[00:02:30] using your previous methods when you say
[00:02:32] you sort of Crash what do you mean by
[00:02:35] that I I think I just didn't want to do
[00:02:38] it anymore like uh I I'd be so tired I'd
[00:02:42] have to I I'd have to make all those
[00:02:44] cards then I'd have to review them and
[00:02:47] then well I'd go I'd go through my
[00:02:49] material I'd have to understand
[00:02:51] everything in detail then I would go one
[00:02:53] by one put those into cards then after
[00:02:55] that I have to review them and then I
[00:02:57] have to do that over and over keep
[00:02:59] reviewing
[00:03:00] and then Plus on top of all my other
[00:03:02] courses I i' I'd just given up and uh
[00:03:06] yeah I didn't really want to study
[00:03:08] anymore right so it sounds like you were
[00:03:09] just getting pretty
[00:03:10] overwhelmed yeah yeah okay so uh the
[00:03:15] higher order stuff in the mind mapping
[00:03:16] that you've been trying uh you've been
[00:03:17] saying that you you struggled with that
[00:03:19] a little bit um what what are the
[00:03:22] methods that you're trying to use and
[00:03:24] then what are the parts you're finding
[00:03:26] quite
[00:03:27] difficult well since I'm pretty new to
[00:03:31] this
[00:03:33] um I haven't been I haven't been like uh
[00:03:36] before a lecture I haven't been
[00:03:37] pre-reading my notes I probably should
[00:03:39] be doing that but after class I usually
[00:03:42] look for uh key terms and then I I can
[00:03:46] connect those together somewhat but then
[00:03:49] afterwards once I get into the key terms
[00:03:52] I start thinking about all these
[00:03:55] details um I start yeah I start thinking
[00:03:58] about all these
[00:04:00] details not really sure where to go from
[00:04:03] there so are you sort of saying that you
[00:04:07] you start thinking about these details
[00:04:08] and because you're kind of getting into
[00:04:10] the details you feel like you're losing
[00:04:12] your kind of higher order train you're
[00:04:14] sort of just getting sucked down into
[00:04:15] memorizing all the different details
[00:04:16] like you were trying to do
[00:04:18] before um yeah I'd say so is that like
[00:04:22] is that kind of the the issue that
[00:04:24] you're facing or is the issue slightly
[00:04:27] different um
[00:04:32] I'd say also just trouble creating
[00:04:39] relationships I
[00:04:42] guess so they as well yeah they're
[00:04:45] probably going to go hand in hand in
[00:04:47] that you're going to struggle with
[00:04:48] creating relationships and that's going
[00:04:49] to stop you from staying away from the
[00:04:51] details and okay so what I'm goingon to
[00:04:54] do is I'm gonna I'm gonna I guess talk a
[00:04:57] little bit just about the just a general
[00:04:58] approach
[00:05:00] um to make sure that we're on the same
[00:05:02] page and to so for everyone watching
[00:05:04] we're all on the same page and then sort
[00:05:06] of go through in a way like a checklist
[00:05:08] of the things that you need to make sure
[00:05:10] that you're doing and then we'll try to
[00:05:12] figure
[00:05:13] out which parts of that checklist you
[00:05:16] might not quite be hitting and I've got
[00:05:18] an idea about what the likely problems
[00:05:20] are that you're facing cuz it's a very
[00:05:22] um kind of like typical type of issue
[00:05:24] that you've got um so I'm very confident
[00:05:26] that we can get on to that um but to
[00:05:28] make this a apprehensive learning
[00:05:30] experience for everyone that's watching
[00:05:31] I'll just go through all the basics and
[00:05:32] the principles as well so if this is
[00:05:34] something that you already familiar with
[00:05:35] cuz you watch all my other content then
[00:05:37] number one well done um and number two
[00:05:40] uh it'll be a little bit basic so I'm
[00:05:42] just going to move you off the screen
[00:05:44] Janelle so I can see the uh everyone can
[00:05:47] see the white board or the green board
[00:05:49] that I've got here
[00:05:52] um yeah please don't draw on it oh sorry
[00:05:56] that's all good um okay
[00:06:00] so the the the way that this works is
[00:06:03] that um there there are some basic
[00:06:06] principles that we have to follow from
[00:06:08] not just higher a of learning but from
[00:06:09] like a system a learning system so I'll
[00:06:11] just go through and and and talk about
[00:06:13] some of those ones instead
[00:06:15] so when we talk about a learning system
[00:06:18] this is very different from learning as
[00:06:21] a singular technique and this is because
[00:06:23] a system is composed of multiple
[00:06:24] techniques and the idea is that no
[00:06:27] single technique is going to be good
[00:06:29] enough to cover all of your needs you
[00:06:31] must have a stack of techniques which
[00:06:36] complement each other and enhance each
[00:06:37] other and so the the first big part of a
[00:06:41] learning system should be the way that
[00:06:42] you're doing your
[00:06:46] pre-study um pre study or or or or
[00:06:49] priming and I'll go into the the way
[00:06:52] that this um Builds on itself shortly
[00:06:54] and then after that we've got what I
[00:06:56] often call the main learning event Main
[00:06:59] learning event or main learning
[00:07:01] experience so for most people going
[00:07:02] through formal education that's going to
[00:07:04] be a class it's going to be a lecture um
[00:07:06] if you're not attending lectures which a
[00:07:09] lot of people aren't um then the main
[00:07:12] learning event could just be your first
[00:07:13] dedicated long sitdown study session the
[00:07:16] main learning event really just means
[00:07:19] the E the experience that you have where
[00:07:21] you're really going through and
[00:07:23] consuming content in like a really
[00:07:26] concentrated way that's going to be your
[00:07:28] main learning event and then after that
[00:07:30] you've got retrieval
[00:07:36] practice uh and retrieval practice is
[00:07:38] often something that has has to happen
[00:07:40] multiple times depending on how much
[00:07:42] time we've got available for it so these
[00:07:44] are these are different components that
[00:07:45] we have to have and you already
[00:07:46] mentioned that you are not always doing
[00:07:49] your pre-study and you you're sort of
[00:07:51] skipping that
[00:07:52] sometimes yeah so that that that's going
[00:07:55] to be a uh
[00:07:58] very just generally disadvantageous move
[00:08:02] because your prudy is really the thing
[00:08:04] that plugs the hole in your in your
[00:08:06] bucket right it's um you can you can
[00:08:10] always catch up on stuff if you fall
[00:08:12] behind but if you've got so much that
[00:08:15] you're falling behind on that all of
[00:08:17] your time is spent catching up then it's
[00:08:19] very difficult to ever really catch up
[00:08:22] because like the hole in the bottom of
[00:08:23] your bucket is is kind of like larger
[00:08:25] than the speed that you're able to
[00:08:27] refill it the pre- study is thing that
[00:08:31] kind of closes that hole it's the thing
[00:08:33] that uh reduces the amount that you're
[00:08:35] forgetting in the first place so even
[00:08:38] though in the short term let's say that
[00:08:40] you've got an hour on a Sunday and
[00:08:43] you're making a decision should I spend
[00:08:45] this hour on pre-study versus reviewing
[00:08:47] the stuff that I'm maybe falling behind
[00:08:48] on you should really always choose to
[00:08:51] spend it on the pre-study because yes
[00:08:54] you'll be falling behind on that hour's
[00:08:55] worth of material for that week or
[00:08:58] something
[00:09:00] however for the for the week to come
[00:09:02] you're going to have less that you're
[00:09:04] falling behind on which means that
[00:09:05] you're going to be in a better position
[00:09:07] so so you can eventually recover and
[00:09:09] catch up from that even if you take that
[00:09:10] short-term loss um so I would you know
[00:09:14] the the first thing that I'd say number
[00:09:16] one as a really high priority thing is
[00:09:18] really you should not be skipping out on
[00:09:21] pre study it's it's really one of the
[00:09:23] most important things that you can try
[00:09:25] to do to reduce the overwhelm your
[00:09:28] ability to tackle the learning during
[00:09:30] the main learning event your ability to
[00:09:32] do the retrieval effectively the amount
[00:09:34] of stuff you need to go through in your
[00:09:35] retrieval practice all of these things
[00:09:37] are going to be impacted by how well
[00:09:39] your brain has been primed to receive
[00:09:41] that knowledge which usually happens in
[00:09:43] the pre- study okay and that's directly
[00:09:45] a segue into some of the higher order
[00:09:47] methods and where you might be having
[00:09:48] some of those issues um so let's just uh
[00:09:53] pull this out here so ultimately with
[00:09:57] with anything that we're doing we we're
[00:09:58] we're trying try to do this
[00:10:00] higher higher order
[00:10:02] learning which I talk about all the time
[00:10:04] and if you're not aware of what that is
[00:10:05] then please check out my other videos as
[00:10:09] well
[00:10:11] the most like the the the simplest
[00:10:14] possible way that we can think about
[00:10:16] doing higher order learning is that
[00:10:18] we're giving meaning to new
[00:10:22] information by putting it into a
[00:10:25] network the the meaning and value of the
[00:10:28] information is being placed in relation
[00:10:31] to other pieces of information and it's
[00:10:34] almost to the point where it's like no
[00:10:36] matter how you achieve that as long as
[00:10:39] you're able to create meaning through
[00:10:42] relating it to other information you're
[00:10:45] going to achieve that and so there's
[00:10:46] there's lots of ways that we can try to
[00:10:48] do that we can try to create and and I'm
[00:10:50] going to give you a bunch of different
[00:10:51] ways that you can try to trigger higher
[00:10:53] order learning and I want you to think
[00:10:54] about this it's
[00:10:56] like in what way does this relate
[00:11:02] information to other information to give
[00:11:04] it
[00:11:05] meaning so creating analogies so
[00:11:08] creating an analogy is a way that we
[00:11:10] trigger higher order
[00:11:11] learning right so if we think about that
[00:11:13] that's because in order to create an
[00:11:15] analogy you can't really create an
[00:11:17] analogy on like a single thing an
[00:11:18] analogy is almost like a story in a way
[00:11:20] there's multiple components and they
[00:11:22] have to flow and relate and interact
[00:11:24] with each other in a way that actually
[00:11:25] makes sense so there's the value
[00:11:27] judgment of that as well to understand
[00:11:30] does this actually make sense or
[00:11:32] not um there's uh there's there's a more
[00:11:37] explicit way that we can um create these
[00:11:39] relationships which is literally just to
[00:11:40] think and ask ourselves how is this
[00:11:43] information related to what I've just
[00:11:45] learned or the alternative which is how
[00:11:48] is this information related to what I
[00:11:50] already know and relating it to our
[00:11:52] prior knowledge um there's also you
[00:11:55] could we could ask ourselves what is the
[00:11:57] relevance to this information in the big
[00:11:59] picture so we can think about it from a
[00:12:00] zoomed out lens to form a big picture
[00:12:04] but all of these different kind of
[00:12:05] mental
[00:12:07] strategies they require you to compare
[00:12:10] the information with other pieces of
[00:12:12] information and
[00:12:14] so something that makes this really
[00:12:16] really hard to do which Janelle you've
[00:12:18] actually already kind of mentioned is
[00:12:20] that if you start getting down right
[00:12:21] into the
[00:12:23] details then it becomes really really
[00:12:25] overwhelming because there's just too
[00:12:27] many things to try to
[00:12:29] uh hold on to and an analogy that I I've
[00:12:32] really been using a lot recently when
[00:12:34] I've been teaching this concept is to
[00:12:36] think of learning like a jigsaw puzzle
[00:12:38] so you know what I mean by a jigsaw
[00:12:40] puzzle like do you still use that word
[00:12:42] in Canada yeah yeah yeah so hopefully
[00:12:44] everyone in the chat you know what I
[00:12:45] mean by a jigsaw puzzle actually let me
[00:12:47] I'm actually curious cuz I use this
[00:12:48] analogy a lot can you let me know in the
[00:12:51] chat is there anyone who comes from a
[00:12:53] country where the word jigsaw puzzle is
[00:12:56] like you don't know what that means I
[00:12:58] would I would
[00:12:59] like to know that
[00:13:01] anyway so this this
[00:13:04] uh if you if you're solving a jigel
[00:13:06] puzzle like how does how do you first
[00:13:08] start you start with just a box full of
[00:13:10] like puzzle pieces
[00:13:12] right Jan know have you have you solved
[00:13:14] many puzzles before personally oh yeah I
[00:13:17] have like a box of puzzles right there
[00:13:19] in front of me okay perfect so when you
[00:13:21] sove a puzzle how do you start like what
[00:13:25] do you
[00:13:26] do what's your proc I just like I at the
[00:13:29] picture like I look at the picture on
[00:13:30] the box right yeah so that's the obvious
[00:13:33] one you look at in fact you probably
[00:13:34] don't even buy it if you doesn't even
[00:13:36] know what the picture on the box looks
[00:13:37] like for most people so you look at the
[00:13:38] picture on the box and then what you
[00:13:40] open the box and you see all the pieces
[00:13:41] that are in the Box what do you do next
[00:13:44] oh yeah I I sort them out I like go with
[00:13:46] edges and then like sort them by color
[00:13:49] exactly and like sort by the inside
[00:13:51] pieces now I want you to think about the
[00:13:53] process you're using to do that you're
[00:13:55] sorting out and you're you're kind of
[00:13:58] like grouping the pieces together based
[00:14:01] on similarities that they have that you
[00:14:04] feel are
[00:14:05] meaningful right so the edge pieces you
[00:14:09] sort together because you know that the
[00:14:10] edge pieces are meaningful because they
[00:14:13] form the outer boundary they're like the
[00:14:15] easiest things like you don't you don't
[00:14:18] like you know where it's going to fit
[00:14:19] like it's going to be somewhere on that
[00:14:20] edge you don't know where on that edge
[00:14:22] necessarily at first but you know it's
[00:14:23] going to be somewhere on the edge so
[00:14:25] they're kind of the easiest places to
[00:14:26] start often right so you know that you
[00:14:29] can group those Edge pieces
[00:14:32] together and then when you have I'll
[00:14:35] just bring you back cuz I'm talking to
[00:14:36] you um and then when you have all your
[00:14:41] Edge pieces clustered together then you
[00:14:43] know maybe for example uh let's say that
[00:14:45] you you're doing a jigsaw puzzle of like
[00:14:48] someone riding a bike through a city you
[00:14:51] know and then you can say okay well all
[00:14:52] these like blue pieces are probably part
[00:14:55] of the sky so you might get all the like
[00:14:58] blue looking pieces together and like
[00:14:59] say okay that that might be like the sky
[00:15:01] and you might have all the parts that
[00:15:03] look like the I don't know the the house
[00:15:05] and you you know kind of maybe group
[00:15:07] some of those together and then you
[00:15:08] probably have some pieces that are left
[00:15:10] over that you like don't really know
[00:15:12] where it
[00:15:13] fits um and so you might just like knock
[00:15:15] group them or you put them in like a
[00:15:16] miscellaneous pile of just like random
[00:15:18] pieces that probably go somewhere but
[00:15:19] you don't really know exactly where it
[00:15:21] goes right so that's that's the process
[00:15:23] that you use when you're solving a Joka
[00:15:25] puzzle
[00:15:26] right yes makes sense yeah
[00:15:30] so that is the exact same process that
[00:15:33] we want to use when we're learning new
[00:15:36] information the difference is you don't
[00:15:39] know what the big picture is going to
[00:15:40] look like it's a jigsaw puzzle that
[00:15:42] doesn't have an image on it and actually
[00:15:44] there are jigsaw puzzles that you can
[00:15:45] buy that don't have the image on like
[00:15:47] you got to figure it out yourself it's
[00:15:49] like a you know like a really painful
[00:15:50] way to do a jigsaw puzzle but some
[00:15:51] people really love that so if you're
[00:15:54] doing that your strategy is still going
[00:15:55] to be the same if you've got a jigsaw
[00:15:57] puzzle where you don't even know what
[00:15:58] it's going to look like at the end it's
[00:16:01] the exact same process you're going to
[00:16:02] use you're probably still going to look
[00:16:04] for the edge pieces and then you're
[00:16:06] still going to look at each piece to see
[00:16:09] how they might be similar to each other
[00:16:12] and so instead of forming these groups
[00:16:14] that you're like a little bit more
[00:16:15] certain about you'd form these groups of
[00:16:17] pieces that are like slightly more
[00:16:20] hypothetical sorry not
[00:16:22] hypothetical that are more of a
[00:16:24] hypothesis right you're like maybe these
[00:16:27] pieces are grouped together like I think
[00:16:30] like they're all very similar colors I
[00:16:32] think they might all be related to
[00:16:33] something and you don't know what
[00:16:34] picture it forms yet but you're at least
[00:16:36] trying to group them together to create
[00:16:38] some kind of meaning from them right you
[00:16:40] following along so far with this analogy
[00:16:42] it makes sense right yeah
[00:16:44] yeah now imagine trying to solve this
[00:16:47] jigsaw puzzle but instead
[00:16:50] of uh you know doing it this way you
[00:16:54] take one piece and you look at this
[00:16:57] piece you try try to memorize exactly
[00:17:00] what this piece looks
[00:17:01] like and once you feel like you've
[00:17:03] completely memorized what this piece
[00:17:05] looks like you put it down and you pick
[00:17:08] up another piece and you memorize
[00:17:10] exactly what that piece looks like and
[00:17:12] you understand everything about this
[00:17:13] piece you know how many millimeters one
[00:17:15] edges you know you know exactly the
[00:17:18] color and it goes from like one shade to
[00:17:19] another shade you know there's a
[00:17:20] gradient and there's like a 3 mm like
[00:17:23] dot of red on the corner like you know
[00:17:25] every single thing about this and then
[00:17:27] once you've memorized it completely you
[00:17:29] put it down and you pick up another
[00:17:30] piece imagine solving a jigel puzzle by
[00:17:34] doing that and trying to like form the
[00:17:37] picture
[00:17:38] somehow through having memorized each
[00:17:41] individual piece like how long would it
[00:17:44] take to solve a jigsaw puzzle by doing
[00:17:47] it that way right you can imagine that
[00:17:49] pretty long yeah in fact I I would say
[00:17:51] like if you could even do that
[00:17:54] like I I I I feel I feel like it would
[00:17:57] be literally impossible like I think I
[00:17:58] could spend my whole life trying to
[00:18:00] solve a single jigsaw puzzle that way
[00:18:01] and maybe like never finish it like by
[00:18:03] the time I'm on my like fourth or fifth
[00:18:05] piece I've honestly just forgotten the
[00:18:07] first piece
[00:18:08] anyway so then I would have to spend
[00:18:10] time to like pick up my first piece
[00:18:13] every five pieces and like constantly
[00:18:16] review it and this is the reason and and
[00:18:19] this is how you know most people use
[00:18:21] Flash Cuts right so yeah if those of you
[00:18:24] watching and listening right now didn't
[00:18:26] realize this has all been an analogy for
[00:18:29] um so this you know this is how most
[00:18:31] people use flash cards is that they will
[00:18:33] just like Focus really really intensely
[00:18:34] on just memorizing and understanding a
[00:18:36] single piece really really deeply and
[00:18:38] then they will just rely on trying to
[00:18:41] form this big picture eventually if they
[00:18:43] ever get time to do that which often
[00:18:44] they don't get time to do that um which
[00:18:47] is why some people will sit an exam and
[00:18:48] then during the exam they'll be like wow
[00:18:50] everything actually like this question
[00:18:51] made me realize and it made sense of the
[00:18:54] topic like they're learning during the
[00:18:56] exam which is not
[00:18:58] what you want to
[00:19:00] happen so your
[00:19:03] brain wants to form that big picture
[00:19:05] image once it understands the big
[00:19:07] picture imit it has it has more
[00:19:08] relevance it has more meaning and
[00:19:10] therefore it's easier to remember and
[00:19:11] it's easier to make sense of and it's
[00:19:12] easier to use that knowledge so the most
[00:19:15] important thing that we need to do when
[00:19:16] we're learning is sift through the
[00:19:18] pieces to try to create that big
[00:19:21] picture right and because we don't know
[00:19:23] what the picture looks like initially
[00:19:26] our big picture is going to be a
[00:19:27] hypothesis we're going to there's a
[00:19:29] hypothesis that we think the big picture
[00:19:31] looks a certain way and we're going to
[00:19:33] create these groups and we're going to
[00:19:34] we're going to work with them to see if
[00:19:37] that is truly the picture uh that we
[00:19:40] have hypothesized and we're probably
[00:19:41] going to be wrong but as we're
[00:19:43] continuing to build it out it's going to
[00:19:45] become clearer and clearer and clearer
[00:19:46] and more and more easy to do that so um
[00:19:50] Janelle probably What's Happening Here
[00:19:52] is that right now the reason that you're
[00:19:54] struggling probably is because you have
[00:19:56] a lot of the um kind of of habits of
[00:19:59] like trying to memorize each individual
[00:20:02] piece yeah and then when you start like
[00:20:04] laying down some of the edge pieces and
[00:20:06] you pick up a piece you kind of fall
[00:20:09] into the habit of like trying to
[00:20:11] memorize that piece instead of
[00:20:14] immediately just like trying to play
[00:20:15] around with it and and create these
[00:20:17] groups and so there's two things that
[00:20:20] you can do to try to train yourself out
[00:20:23] of that well the first thing is being
[00:20:24] aware of it which is it's like the zero
[00:20:26] thing it's just being aware that you you
[00:20:27] should try not to do
[00:20:29] that um but just like you would when you
[00:20:33] when you have a a jigsaw puzzle you've
[00:20:35] said that you've got your key terms and
[00:20:37] when you go through the key
[00:20:39] terms when you try to group those key
[00:20:42] terms together I want you to think about
[00:20:45] it very consciously by asking
[00:20:49] yourself why you think grouping it
[00:20:52] grouping these terms a certain way makes
[00:20:54] sense or or is important or relevant
[00:20:58] don't just group things together because
[00:21:00] you feel like they could be grouped
[00:21:02] together actually explicitly think about
[00:21:05] what type of group you think this
[00:21:07] represents and why that group is
[00:21:11] valuable or meaningful it's just like
[00:21:13] when you're serving a jigsaw puzzle you
[00:21:14] You' group them together because you
[00:21:16] have a hypothesis that this forms the
[00:21:18] sky or the road or the house when you're
[00:21:21] grouping the ideas together you want to
[00:21:22] know exactly what that group represents
[00:21:24] because remember your hypothesis is
[00:21:26] probably going to be wrong initially
[00:21:28] and so you want to be able to know why
[00:21:30] you're grouping it so that when you when
[00:21:33] you reflect on it and you adjust it
[00:21:35] you're actually making a meaningful
[00:21:36] adjustment it's not just kind of like oh
[00:21:37] this group didn't work and now you're
[00:21:39] kind of just left with all these
[00:21:40] isolated Concepts again right there's a
[00:21:43] there's there's a clear hypothesis that
[00:21:45] you're
[00:21:46] testing with each group that you form
[00:21:50] always come back to your existing set of
[00:21:53] groups and see if the picture is getting
[00:21:57] clearer if the picture is not getting
[00:21:59] clearer change your groups around that's
[00:22:03] the second
[00:22:05] thing as uh just like with a jigsa
[00:22:07] puzzle as you continue to solve it it
[00:22:10] should be getting easier because the
[00:22:12] picture is
[00:22:13] forming right like the first the hardest
[00:22:17] like the easiest part is forming the
[00:22:18] edge and then the hardest part is
[00:22:20] actually forming like the next layer
[00:22:22] that comes in from the edge but once
[00:22:24] you've got that it gets easier and
[00:22:25] easier cuz there's less pieces that you
[00:22:27] need to work through and there's more of
[00:22:28] a big picture that's forming so it's
[00:22:30] more about just like filling in the
[00:22:32] gaps the easiest part about uh you know
[00:22:36] the high order learning process is
[00:22:38] forming your first initial groups the
[00:22:40] hard part is refining those groups to
[00:22:44] see what actually forms the clearer
[00:22:45] picture so you do this let me get my
[00:22:50] green board out
[00:22:52] again this is what you
[00:22:54] do
[00:22:56] you number
[00:22:59] one
[00:23:01] uh you form groups and as we said these
[00:23:04] groups they have to be very very
[00:23:08] explicit um really like challenge your
[00:23:11] reasoning don't just don't just like
[00:23:12] make these groups and say oh they feel
[00:23:14] like they all kind of related together
[00:23:15] or like uh they they were under the same
[00:23:17] chapter heading or like oh my lecturer
[00:23:19] spoke them within the same minute of
[00:23:21] each other like these are not good
[00:23:23] reasons like you have to have a group
[00:23:26] that even if you were to just give it to
[00:23:27] some random other person they would look
[00:23:29] at these same groups and think think yes
[00:23:32] that's a very logical way of grouping it
[00:23:34] together so make really really explicit
[00:23:36] groups and then number two continue to
[00:23:40] refine each
[00:23:44] group by
[00:23:48] comparing to
[00:23:51] the big
[00:23:53] picture and this this is kind of like a
[00:23:56] a cyclical process that occurs
[00:24:03] so every time you form a group you then
[00:24:06] look at the other groups you formed and
[00:24:08] then you try to bring it together and
[00:24:10] then you ask yourself okay now instead
[00:24:12] of one group I've got two groups do
[00:24:14] these two groups actually make sense
[00:24:16] with each other like does it actually
[00:24:18] form like a more cohesive story for this
[00:24:21] topic if the answer is no maybe we try
[00:24:24] one more group see if we can build out
[00:24:26] that story a little bit more so we
[00:24:27] create another group and once we've
[00:24:29] grouped that and then we put it together
[00:24:31] and try to create a flow to see how they
[00:24:33] interact with each other we ask
[00:24:34] ourselves again like did this make it
[00:24:36] clearer is the big picture of this topic
[00:24:38] becoming clearer to me if the answer is
[00:24:40] still no after like three groups
[00:24:43] probably the way that you've grouped it
[00:24:45] needs to be changed so what you do is
[00:24:48] you just break the groups you bring them
[00:24:49] out into the original terms again you
[00:24:51] look for an alternative way to group the
[00:24:54] information and this process of just
[00:24:56] going back and forth group grouping and
[00:24:58] ungrouping and checking and making sure
[00:24:59] that it makes sense and just asking
[00:25:01] yourself this question of like does it
[00:25:03] make sense can I group this group it
[00:25:05] this way this takes time this takes
[00:25:07] effort and in fact it takes uh like
[00:25:09] literal resources you need to go into
[00:25:11] your learning materials you need to read
[00:25:13] your textbook you need to Google things
[00:25:15] to figure out whether this group makes
[00:25:18] sense or
[00:25:19] not and all of that is going to be
[00:25:23] effective for
[00:25:25] learning by the time you do this process
[00:25:28] again and again you'll have like your
[00:25:30] major groups formed for the overall
[00:25:32] topic and then you're going to group
[00:25:34] them again like you're going to form
[00:25:35] subgroups with within those big groups
[00:25:37] you're going to form and so it's exactly
[00:25:40] the same process but you're just having
[00:25:41] smaller and smaller groups until you get
[00:25:43] to the point where there's nothing to
[00:25:43] group anymore they're just individual
[00:25:46] Concepts but by doing that you're
[00:25:48] actually building on a web so if you're
[00:25:51] if you're using like a my map kind of
[00:25:53] technique it should it should look
[00:25:54] something like this I'll just move this
[00:25:56] over here so we can can still see that
[00:25:58] hope you can all see that
[00:26:02] still yeah
[00:26:05] so at first you'd have just like a list
[00:26:10] of kind of Concepts that that are there
[00:26:13] and then you take these Concepts and
[00:26:15] then you try to think okay can I group
[00:26:16] it into this one and then can I group uh
[00:26:19] maybe this one and these together into
[00:26:21] another group and then maybe I can group
[00:26:24] this one and this one and this one into
[00:26:26] another group and then so you'd have
[00:26:28] these three groups
[00:26:31] together and You' think how could these
[00:26:33] groups relate to each other potentially
[00:26:35] and you might say okay well there's
[00:26:36] maybe this kind of thing that works and
[00:26:39] you might say actually that doesn't make
[00:26:40] sense so you get rid of that and then
[00:26:42] you go back to the list and you'd form a
[00:26:44] different type of group so maybe you'd
[00:26:45] group it you know this way instead so
[00:26:47] and then you do that until you get to a
[00:26:48] point where you're actually pretty
[00:26:49] comfortable with the fact that you've
[00:26:51] got these kind of main groups and you
[00:26:54] understand the relationship that these
[00:26:55] groups have with each other
[00:26:58] and then once you're at that point you
[00:27:00] then will be branching it
[00:27:02] out and then when you Branch it out
[00:27:04] you're going to ask the same question
[00:27:06] does this relationship make sense does
[00:27:09] this continue to make sense and so as
[00:27:10] you continue it to expand out over time
[00:27:13] this gets increasingly larger and more
[00:27:17] complex and then once you've fleshed it
[00:27:19] out more fully you can go through to see
[00:27:21] if you can simplify it even more at no
[00:27:24] point during this process are you ever
[00:27:28] reading or consuming information for any
[00:27:32] other reason than to see whether the
[00:27:35] groups and flow that you've created
[00:27:38] makes sense that's key
[00:27:43] here as soon as you start consuming
[00:27:46] information just for the sake of
[00:27:49] consuming information or as soon as you
[00:27:52] start covering material just because
[00:27:55] it's there that's when you start losing
[00:27:57] cuz that's now falling into a lower
[00:27:59] order
[00:28:01] habit the the the intention the reason
[00:28:04] the purpose for consuming the
[00:28:06] information needs to be to solve the
[00:28:08] puzzle to form the picture and that
[00:28:11] framing means that you can read the same
[00:28:14] sentence the exact same paragraph the
[00:28:17] same list of bullet points but it has
[00:28:19] more meaning to you because it forms
[00:28:22] part of a bigger
[00:28:24] picture if you really really really
[00:28:26] struggle with holding yourself
[00:28:27] accountable to to thinking in this way
[00:28:30] actually set yourself a timer maybe
[00:28:31] every 5 minutes or 10 minutes set a
[00:28:33] timer that just goes off and every time
[00:28:35] the timer goes off you you stop you paus
[00:28:38] and you ask yourself am I consuming and
[00:28:41] reading and learning for the sake of
[00:28:43] figuring out the big picture or am I
[00:28:46] just reading it because I I I got sucked
[00:28:50] into a paragraph and I'm just trying to
[00:28:51] understand it am I trying to understand
[00:28:54] so that I can clarify my groups and my
[00:28:57] Rel relationships and create a flow that
[00:28:59] I feel like makes
[00:29:01] sense or am I just reading to
[00:29:06] understand the understanding
[00:29:10] um like understanding and good memory
[00:29:14] are a side effect and a symptom of
[00:29:19] creating a good organizational
[00:29:22] structure uh it's not the primary
[00:29:24] outcome we don't aim to get
[00:29:27] memory and understanding memory and
[00:29:30] understanding are formed as part of
[00:29:34] forming a good organizational structure
[00:29:38] I think that's really crucial to
[00:29:40] understand uh because it's
[00:29:42] counterintuitive uh it's
[00:29:44] counterintuitive that when you try to
[00:29:46] deliberately create better memory and
[00:29:49] understanding by trying to remember and
[00:29:51] understand it's actually less efficient
[00:29:54] than trying to create structure and
[00:29:56] meaning at a big picture level where the
[00:29:59] me the memorization understanding come
[00:30:01] as part of that and then after you've
[00:30:03] done that then you'd go through and see
[00:30:04] what You' forgotten and then that stuff
[00:30:06] you can Chuck into your flash cards and
[00:30:07] your ankey but you'd have only 20% of
[00:30:09] what you'd normally have because you've
[00:30:11] already remembered and understood the
[00:30:13] rest so that's kind of just like a like
[00:30:15] a in to-end sort of flow there that I've
[00:30:18] kind of rambled on about so far um
[00:30:21] Janelle did you have any like based on
[00:30:23] what I've just said right
[00:30:26] now and you kind of reflect on your own
[00:30:28] learning methods which yeah like which
[00:30:32] part of what I said to you feels maybe
[00:30:35] like different to what you might already
[00:30:37] be doing well like really stands out as
[00:30:38] like okay that's something that I'm kind
[00:30:40] of catching myself
[00:30:41] on um I think one thing that stood out
[00:30:45] to me probably was that your hypothesis
[00:30:48] can be wrong because when I put it onto
[00:30:51] Ani it's like I have this information
[00:30:54] it's like Chuck it onto the card and
[00:30:56] that's the information
[00:30:58] like the idea that I can be wrong but I
[00:31:00] can go back and change it and keep
[00:31:02] rearranging it's pretty foreign to me
[00:31:04] I'd say yeah and I think that's um so
[00:31:07] it's a really interesting concept
[00:31:09] because like there's a level of
[00:31:11] uncertainty right like when when when
[00:31:13] you're like not sure how everything fits
[00:31:15] together it creates this confusion and
[00:31:17] uncertainty and it can even cause like
[00:31:19] insecurity but that State of Mind where
[00:31:22] you're really like confused is actually
[00:31:25] really good for learning because it puts
[00:31:27] your brain in this kind of problem
[00:31:28] solving mode and therefore like that
[00:31:31] like confusion is a sign that your brain
[00:31:34] is trying to figure something out which
[00:31:37] is exactly what you want like imagine
[00:31:40] doing a jigsaw puzzle where like there
[00:31:43] is no confusion whatsoever you just
[00:31:45] literally pick up all the pieces and you
[00:31:47] just like it's it's just like a
[00:31:48] procedure like like you're just filling
[00:31:50] it like some kind of robot you know that
[00:31:53] number one would be insane but also
[00:31:55] number two you know it's like there
[00:31:59] there's there's obviously no like mental
[00:32:00] engagement going on there so that if
[00:32:03] you're feeling confused and you're
[00:32:04] feeling like uncertain and you're like
[00:32:06] not sure how it all fits together and
[00:32:08] like that that's the feeling that you
[00:32:10] have while you study that's actually a
[00:32:12] good thing like that's a that's a sign
[00:32:14] that you're really trying to think in
[00:32:16] the right way don't avoid
[00:32:19] that like if you if you try to avoid
[00:32:21] that by just focusing on understanding
[00:32:23] all the individual details that's when
[00:32:25] you fall into the Trap because you
[00:32:27] haven't actually crystallized it you
[00:32:29] haven't actually solved it all you've
[00:32:31] done is you've just left the puzzle on
[00:32:33] the table and you've gone to do
[00:32:34] something
[00:32:35] else right it's still unsolved and you
[00:32:38] know if if in in an exam that's how
[00:32:41] you're being tested you're going to wish
[00:32:42] you had spent the time to solve that in
[00:32:44] advance are there any other aspects that
[00:32:47] I've kind of talked about that you have
[00:32:49] some questions or uncertainties on or
[00:32:51] you need some clarification
[00:32:53] around
[00:32:56] um
[00:33:00] um I guess also I don't I don't know if
[00:33:03] I have a question right now but the idea
[00:33:05] of you like saying
[00:33:07] uncertainty is
[00:33:11] okay uh because I'm also very used to
[00:33:15] because what they say in school is oh
[00:33:17] you have to you always have to
[00:33:19] understand yeah the material before you
[00:33:22] put it into the problem set so that's
[00:33:26] that's once I start going into the Mind
[00:33:28] map I'd be so I'd be so lost I'm like
[00:33:31] where where is this going yeah like it
[00:33:33] seems like I don't really have like a
[00:33:36] goal yeah so Clarity is your goal what
[00:33:39] I'm saying is uncertainty is is is a
[00:33:42] good part of the process you don't want
[00:33:44] to stay uncertain
[00:33:45] forever but the uncertainty is like the
[00:33:47] necessary part to get to certainty
[00:33:50] that's actually meaningful cuz the worst
[00:33:52] case scenario is that you get the
[00:33:53] certainty but the certainty is based on
[00:33:55] like an illusion of knowledge
[00:33:57] like you don't actually know it you just
[00:33:59] think you know it and so what they say
[00:34:01] in school is often like yeah you need to
[00:34:04] understand things okay first of all
[00:34:05] teachers are not trained on learning
[00:34:07] science so actually what they say in
[00:34:09] school is not reflective of like
[00:34:12] upto-date you know like methods and
[00:34:13] knowledge and I'm not like bagging on
[00:34:15] teachers it's just not part of their
[00:34:16] training that's not really primarily
[00:34:18] their job
[00:34:20] um but the other thing is that it's not
[00:34:23] it's not that it's wrong you do have to
[00:34:24] understand it but what we're talking
[00:34:26] about right now is the process that you
[00:34:27] use to get to the understanding right
[00:34:30] it's like saying okay you need to build
[00:34:32] a house you can build a house in many
[00:34:35] different ways you can choose to build
[00:34:37] an entire house with a single
[00:34:39] screwdriver and if you do that your
[00:34:42] hands are going to bleed and you're
[00:34:43] going to be building that house for like
[00:34:44] 20 years and it's going to be amazing if
[00:34:47] you can actually build a house with a
[00:34:48] single
[00:34:49] screwdriver there is a more effective
[00:34:51] way of building the house you use
[00:34:53] different tools at different times uh
[00:34:56] and and through a different process the
[00:34:59] again the understanding is the symptom
[00:35:02] of the process so yes you have to get to
[00:35:05] understanding but the more efficient and
[00:35:07] more robust way of getting to the
[00:35:10] understanding happens to use a process
[00:35:12] that at first has a lot of uncertainty
[00:35:15] as part of it right in a way you can
[00:35:18] kind of think about it like this it's
[00:35:20] like the
[00:35:22] uncertainty means that you are aware of
[00:35:26] what you do not know and as soon and
[00:35:29] you're opening yourself up to all the
[00:35:30] things you don't know so it's really
[00:35:33] clear and then you are systematically
[00:35:35] addressing the things that you don't
[00:35:37] know and that's the process through
[00:35:39] which you're arriving at certainty and
[00:35:42] understanding but we're starting from
[00:35:43] being like okay let's let's get
[00:35:45] everything we don't know on the table
[00:35:46] first like let's be clear about what our
[00:35:48] uncertainty is and let's start working
[00:35:51] through the uncertainty to to find the
[00:35:53] meaning in that whereas if if you start
[00:35:57] from a position where you're not aware
[00:35:59] of where your uncertainties
[00:36:01] are and then you're trying to go through
[00:36:04] and and gain certainty you're sort of
[00:36:07] you're sort of like tricking yourself
[00:36:09] and then you're avoiding finding those
[00:36:11] gaps and then what happens is that those
[00:36:12] gaps get revealed to you eventually
[00:36:16] anyway and and actually that's a lot
[00:36:18] worse because it causes that can cause a
[00:36:19] lot of anxiety and a lot of problems
[00:36:21] because then you'll be studying but your
[00:36:23] internal sense of like how good your
[00:36:25] learning is going is not accur it
[00:36:27] anymore so if you do worse than an exam
[00:36:29] you don't know why and you don't know
[00:36:31] how to fix it because you don't know
[00:36:32] where it went wrong cuz when you were
[00:36:33] studying it actually felt
[00:36:36] good make
[00:36:38] sense yeah yeah um yeah but good
[00:36:42] question good
[00:36:43] question for the sake of time um we're
[00:36:46] going to move on to Sonia uh but Janelle
[00:36:50] please like keep keep thinking of
[00:36:51] questions and things and then hopefully
[00:36:52] towards the end of this we'll I we'll
[00:36:54] just come back and see if there's any
[00:36:55] other questions um for you but
[00:36:57] okay yeah thanks for sharing that Sonia
[00:36:59] I'm going to bring you onto the
[00:37:03] uh
[00:37:05] on it's going to Spotlight you on
[00:37:09] here
[00:37:14] Spotlight yeah Sonia could you please um
[00:37:18] just introduce yourself just you know uh
[00:37:22] where are you from what educational
[00:37:24] stage are you what type of stuff are you
[00:37:25] learning uh and what are some of the
[00:37:27] struggles that you have been
[00:37:30] facing yeah my name is Sonia I'm from
[00:37:34] India and uh India has many states so
[00:37:38] I'm from
[00:37:39] harana
[00:37:41] so I have done my bachelor in education
[00:37:44] and I have done Masters in
[00:37:46] Psychology and I have done a diploma in
[00:37:49] guidance and counseling also so uh I'm
[00:37:52] preparing for net it is an exam in India
[00:37:55] for assistant Prof Professor so that we
[00:37:57] can teach in colleges or
[00:37:59] universities uh the problem I'm facing
[00:38:03] is that I'm not being able to be
[00:38:06] consistent throughout my studies and I'm
[00:38:09] not revising the stuff I'm only further
[00:38:12] and further
[00:38:14] study yeah so so uh there's a couple
[00:38:17] things that you mentioned there number
[00:38:18] one was that you don't have the
[00:38:19] consistency and then the second thing
[00:38:21] was that you aren't revising you're just
[00:38:23] kind of studying further so that second
[00:38:25] Point uh do you mean that um you don't
[00:38:28] have time to like review what you've
[00:38:30] already learned and you're just spending
[00:38:32] all of your time just like learning more
[00:38:33] and more and more things is that what
[00:38:35] you meant by
[00:38:36] that yeah okay and and and why is so
[00:38:40] actually why is it for both so what's
[00:38:42] the reason you're not consistent when
[00:38:45] you say you're what do you what do you
[00:38:46] mean when you say you're not
[00:38:49] consistent uh see as I'm am a mother of
[00:38:52] two so I'm not able to be consistent
[00:38:56] through my
[00:38:58] studies is that just because of lack of
[00:39:00] time too many responsibilities too many
[00:39:03] things you're trying to juggle yes yes
[00:39:05] okay yes have too many responsibil So
[00:39:08] when you say you're not consistent what
[00:39:09] does that look like it means what you
[00:39:10] study on one day and then you're not
[00:39:12] able to study on another day or is it
[00:39:14] that you plan to study on one day but
[00:39:16] then something happens and then you
[00:39:18] can't and then you you know you plan to
[00:39:20] study on another day and sometimes you
[00:39:22] can like so what does what does it mean
[00:39:24] I want to really be able to visualize
[00:39:25] what it means for you to be
[00:39:28] inconsistent yeah yeah see uh I make my
[00:39:31] schedules for daily and one day I'm
[00:39:34] consistent I am doing whatever I have
[00:39:36] planned for me and next day something
[00:39:39] comes up to me and uh so I'm not able to
[00:39:42] do next schedules that I have scheduled
[00:39:45] for me
[00:39:49] okay so there's two there's there's a
[00:39:51] couple different ways that we can try to
[00:39:53] try to tackle this um so what's really
[00:39:56] important here for for me as a coach is
[00:39:58] to really understand where the root
[00:40:00] cause is and it's not to say that
[00:40:02] there's always one root cause uh there's
[00:40:04] usually multiple reasons that things
[00:40:05] happen but we need to really understand
[00:40:07] the root cause otherwise the advice I
[00:40:09] give you is not going to be very
[00:40:10] effective so I'm thinking about it from
[00:40:12] two different angles right now is it a
[00:40:14] time and task management problem or is
[00:40:16] it a kind of learning aspect um aspect
[00:40:20] problem and it could be both right so it
[00:40:22] could be time and task management in
[00:40:25] that there are some methods and
[00:40:27] techniques that you could use that make
[00:40:28] your schedules more flexible and more
[00:40:30] adaptable that make it so that when
[00:40:32] things arise you're able to you're able
[00:40:34] to roll with it and you're able to um
[00:40:36] adapt and overcome a little bit more
[00:40:37] easily so that could be one possible uh
[00:40:41] angle the other possible angle is that
[00:40:44] your method of learning could be too
[00:40:46] either timec consuming or too um too big
[00:40:50] too cumbersome like it you need to sit
[00:40:52] down at your desk and have perfect
[00:40:54] silence and you need to have you know
[00:40:55] all of your books out in front of you
[00:40:57] and you need at least 2 hours and like
[00:40:59] there could be too many requirements for
[00:41:01] you to have effective learning that
[00:41:04] makes it so that man your time
[00:41:06] management would have to be amazing to
[00:41:09] be able to study and fulfill all those
[00:41:11] requirements and that's what I'm trying
[00:41:12] to work out right now um based on that
[00:41:16] do you have an idea about which one
[00:41:19] where you think the issue is or maybe
[00:41:20] it's a bit of both maybe there's some
[00:41:22] time management methods you could use
[00:41:23] that make you more adaptable and then
[00:41:25] maybe there's some ways that your
[00:41:26] learning could be a little bit more
[00:41:28] flexible as well or is it just more one
[00:41:30] than the other what do you
[00:41:33] think no both I have time management
[00:41:36] also as see sometimes I'm studying for
[00:41:40] four to five hours continuously I study
[00:41:43] and sometimes I don't get time to study
[00:41:45] for one to two hours
[00:41:47] also okay so if you let's say that let's
[00:41:50] say that you had only
[00:41:53] um let's say that you had 30 minutes you
[00:41:56] got 30 minutes
[00:41:57] available would you be a do you would
[00:42:00] you feel that you can use that 30
[00:42:01] minutes of time to study
[00:42:05] effectively uh I can use that you can
[00:42:07] use that yeah so um so let's say that
[00:42:11] you've got a you know you've got a busy
[00:42:13] day you've got lots of things going on
[00:42:15] but between each thing each event you
[00:42:18] have an hour available right so just
[00:42:22] before lunch you've got an hour and then
[00:42:24] uh you know at 3:00 you've got another
[00:42:26] hour hour and then at you know 8:00 p.m.
[00:42:27] you've got another hour so throughout
[00:42:29] the day you've got three
[00:42:31] hours do you feel that if you had those
[00:42:34] slots of time and if there if there are
[00:42:36] no distractions that stop you from using
[00:42:38] that time do you feel that the method
[00:42:40] that you use to learn would allow you to
[00:42:43] get some good learning done within those
[00:42:46] little 1 hour
[00:42:48] blocks yes I can do that okay so
[00:42:52] therefore I think the problem is
[00:42:54] probably to do with a time man
[00:42:56] management side right CU if you're able
[00:42:57] to study effectively in those 1 hour
[00:42:59] blocks then your learning method is
[00:43:01] probably going to be you know not going
[00:43:03] to be the thing that's limiting you yet
[00:43:06] so when we think about the way that
[00:43:08] we're um managing time and tasks it's
[00:43:12] important that we are thinking about the
[00:43:14] two differently I'll start with the time
[00:43:16] management side of things so time
[00:43:17] management is really fundamentally it's
[00:43:20] just about how you schedule and then how
[00:43:21] you adjust your schedule it's it's
[00:43:24] really that's that's all it is
[00:43:27] um when you create a a daily schedule
[00:43:31] what's your approach to doing that I
[00:43:32] want you to like walk me through exactly
[00:43:34] what you would do as soon as
[00:43:36] you start your scheduling process like
[00:43:39] do you have a a calendar do you have an
[00:43:41] app you know what do you fill in first
[00:43:44] um how do you decide how your day is
[00:43:45] going to look
[00:43:48] like no actually I'm not making any
[00:43:51] schedule in return return I'm just
[00:43:54] thinking whenever I get time I have to
[00:43:56] study in morning I study after 9 and to
[00:44:01] 1
[00:44:02] p.m. okay I'm going to write this down
[00:44:05] so I'm going to bring this screen over
[00:44:10] here I'm just adjusting my screen share
[00:44:15] here okay that'll
[00:44:20] do
[00:44:23] um Okay so
[00:44:26] so uh just go walk through that again
[00:44:28] for me
[00:44:30] please so you're not you're not making a
[00:44:32] schedule
[00:44:34] yeah no no in return I'm not making but
[00:44:38] I uh whenever I get time I study see up
[00:44:41] to eight my children have gone to school
[00:44:44] MH uh after that I do one for one I do
[00:44:47] my household chores and after nine I
[00:44:50] start studying and up to 1 I do it I
[00:44:54] want to do it regularly but but I'm not
[00:44:56] consistent with that sometime I skip
[00:44:58] these okay and what's the reason that
[00:45:01] you would skip
[00:45:04] it see many many time many time I have
[00:45:08] other task also of household chores or
[00:45:12] something I have to go to market and so
[00:45:15] that's why I'm facing problem okay and
[00:45:18] these other tasks are they predictable
[00:45:20] or not
[00:45:23] predictable uh predictable they they are
[00:45:27] sometimes not sometimes not but
[00:45:28] sometimes
[00:45:29] are yeah okay so
[00:45:33] um how let's just say as a general
[00:45:37] percentage how many of your tasks that
[00:45:40] of these tasks that just come up they
[00:45:42] you know are
[00:45:44] predictable um versus not predictable
[00:45:47] like 50/50 or maybe like more
[00:45:49] unpredictable or more
[00:45:52] predictable uh 5050 they are 50/50
[00:45:59] yeah
[00:46:04] okay okay
[00:46:06] so
[00:46:08] um okay so there there there's there's
[00:46:11] straight off the bat there's like two or
[00:46:12] three things that I think that you can
[00:46:13] do that will that will help you um but I
[00:46:15] want to get a little bit more
[00:46:16] information first um how's your how's
[00:46:18] your focus and your attention and your
[00:46:20] and your energy and your ability to kind
[00:46:22] of uh you know do work and studying
[00:46:24] things throughout the day gener pretty
[00:46:26] good most of the day or do you are there
[00:46:28] certain times of the day or certain
[00:46:29] periods or certain things that really
[00:46:30] Tire you out and after that you just
[00:46:32] can't
[00:46:34] study see I'm very much focused for 9 to
[00:46:37] one from 9 to one and after that yeah
[00:46:40] after that my children come from school
[00:46:43] and so after that I can't study right
[00:46:47] and then are are you basically done you
[00:46:49] like from after your children come home
[00:46:52] you're just done for the whole day or do
[00:46:53] you get like a little pocket somewhere
[00:46:56] during that time where you're okay
[00:46:59] again no at night I get after 9 I get
[00:47:03] time okay and then after 9: you get time
[00:47:06] okay yeah now okay now sometimes okay
[00:47:10] not always but sometimes
[00:47:13] um is it possible during the day also
[00:47:17] for you to be able to focus and not like
[00:47:22] you know maybe uh maybe your kids are
[00:47:25] playing or doing something or doing
[00:47:27] homework or whatever that they might be
[00:47:28] doing where you can have kind of like a
[00:47:31] focused time maybe they've got a focus
[00:47:34] time maybe everyone's doing a focus time
[00:47:35] but is there some way that you can
[00:47:37] actually have some time during the day
[00:47:39] that's like protected and focused and
[00:47:41] your kids also know like you know I I I
[00:47:43] shouldn't be shouldn't be you know
[00:47:44] bothering
[00:47:47] her yeah in whenever I study in front of
[00:47:50] my children they
[00:47:52] know that they do not have to bother me
[00:47:55] okay
[00:47:56] so so in that case when you say that
[00:47:59] your children come home at 1: p.m. and
[00:48:01] then you're not able to focus is that
[00:48:05] because it's not that your children are
[00:48:07] bothering you but because you're just
[00:48:08] thinking about your children being there
[00:48:10] that makes you like what's the reason
[00:48:11] that it's hard to focus when your
[00:48:13] children are home yeah uh yeah because I
[00:48:16] think that I have to give time to them
[00:48:18] also sure right I mean which is true uh
[00:48:21] you do but okay so there's a you know
[00:48:25] there's a bit of a balance here okay
[00:48:27] cool I think that's enough to work with
[00:48:30] Okay the first thing that I'm going to
[00:48:31] say is that actually
[00:48:34] um I think the I think the main problem
[00:48:38] here is probably uh just your your your
[00:48:42] time allocation being a little bit
[00:48:45] sporadic um consistency is number one
[00:48:47] very important but it's very hard to get
[00:48:49] consistency if you don't have a good
[00:48:51] understanding of your current Baseline
[00:48:53] um and it's very hard to get a good
[00:48:54] understanding of your current Basel line
[00:48:55] if you don't have like a consistent
[00:48:57] system to go with so there's an
[00:48:59] interesting thing is
[00:49:01] that off the bat I would say that you
[00:49:03] should have a written schedule you
[00:49:05] should have actual times you should have
[00:49:07] an actual uh you know diary of times of
[00:49:10] the day where you're blocking out to do
[00:49:12] certain
[00:49:13] tasks this is not to say you need to use
[00:49:16] a schedule every single day for the rest
[00:49:18] of your life but it does give you better
[00:49:21] Clarity in terms of how you are actually
[00:49:23] spending your time and what you could do
[00:49:25] to try to reallocate that time so for
[00:49:27] example you might say that okay well
[00:49:29] between um you know 7 to 8:00 a.m.
[00:49:33] you're going to do something and you
[00:49:36] think it's going to take you that hour
[00:49:38] but and so you would say okay well I
[00:49:39] think it will take me one hour so You'
[00:49:41] put it into your schedule to take 1 hour
[00:49:43] now one of two things is going to happen
[00:49:45] one it's going to take you an hour or
[00:49:47] number two it's not going to take you an
[00:49:49] hour it will either be shorter or it
[00:49:50] will be longer and that's valuable
[00:49:54] information uh because that that gives
[00:49:56] you a better understanding of how long
[00:49:58] your real time spend actually is so what
[00:50:01] we're talking about here is called time
[00:50:04] tracking um and that makes it much
[00:50:06] easier to plan the other thing is that
[00:50:08] you can notice variations in how long
[00:50:10] certain things take and this is really
[00:50:12] the case for studying so let's say
[00:50:13] between 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. you know
[00:50:15] that that's a great Focus time for you
[00:50:17] to be able to to do things and you can't
[00:50:19] necessarily do all of your housework and
[00:50:21] things when the when the children are
[00:50:23] home maybe uh so so you might say okay
[00:50:26] well between 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. I'm
[00:50:29] going to study and between 9:00 a.m. to
[00:50:32] 10:00 a.m. I'm going to do some focused
[00:50:34] like housework and you'd say okay if I
[00:50:36] think about all the housework that I
[00:50:37] need to get done an hour maybe I can if
[00:50:40] I'm if I'm Focus maybe I can do
[00:50:42] everything in one hour you might say
[00:50:43] that you can you can do that so you'd
[00:50:46] you'd spend one hour and then after an
[00:50:48] hour you'd say okay have I been able to
[00:50:50] do this maybe Monday Tuesday Wednesday
[00:50:53] you can Thursday Friday you can't so now
[00:50:55] this this is data for you and you ask
[00:50:57] yourself well why why is it that Monday
[00:51:00] Tuesday Wednesday I was able to do all
[00:51:02] of my housework but then Thursday Friday
[00:51:04] I can't why did I go overtime or maybe
[00:51:07] every you know maybe um uh you know it
[00:51:11] could be that it's a certain time of the
[00:51:13] it's a certain day of the week is always
[00:51:15] like a little bit slower maybe it's
[00:51:17] because of other conditions maybe
[00:51:19] whenever it's raining there's more
[00:51:21] traffic so it takes longer to get to the
[00:51:23] shop and therefore it takes longer to do
[00:51:25] some of your household chores so it's
[00:51:27] about understanding all the different
[00:51:28] factors that affect your ability to to
[00:51:31] get into this flow and then shifting
[00:51:34] your time blocks around to try to make
[00:51:38] it work as best as as possible so just
[00:51:41] without knowing a lot about you and your
[00:51:44] family and all the all the chores and
[00:51:46] the household things that you need to do
[00:51:48] there's a few things that I would
[00:51:49] suggest at least you should try and it's
[00:51:51] going to be up to you to see whether it
[00:51:53] actually works or not I'm not going to
[00:51:54] presume that I know enough to to
[00:51:55] actually just say you should you should
[00:51:56] do this but I think you should you
[00:51:57] should try some of these things the
[00:51:59] first thing that I think that you should
[00:52:00] try is actually be making a very
[00:52:04] conscious decision about which
[00:52:07] household uh chores that are
[00:52:12] predictable okay you can
[00:52:15] do with your
[00:52:19] children okay either getting your
[00:52:21] children involved or just doing them or
[00:52:25] just getting your kids to do them for
[00:52:27] you or um just just doing them when
[00:52:31] they're when they're home
[00:52:32] again
[00:52:34] right so that's the first thing I would
[00:52:36] I would try if you already know that you
[00:52:39] want to spend you know time with your
[00:52:40] children when they're home uh and you
[00:52:43] know that it's going to be difficult for
[00:52:44] you to focus then make use of that time
[00:52:47] you've got 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m it's a
[00:52:49] it's a good Focus block of time right
[00:52:52] and there's going to be some things that
[00:52:53] you aren't able to do
[00:52:55] uh when your children are home and then
[00:52:57] you can try to do those but I'm sure
[00:52:59] that there are things that you're doing
[00:53:01] between 9:00 a.m. to 1: p.m. that you
[00:53:03] could probably do when your kids are
[00:53:04] home as well and it wouldn't make that
[00:53:07] much of a difference and we just try to
[00:53:08] move as much of that as we
[00:53:11] can the second thing is thinking about
[00:53:13] what are the things that take you more
[00:53:16] concentration more energy more attention
[00:53:19] where you really need to be at your Peak
[00:53:23] and I would be moving those so if we say
[00:53:27] Peak
[00:53:31] concentration and I'd be moving these
[00:53:33] Peak concentration things probably into
[00:53:35] this morning
[00:53:37] area so even in your studying there
[00:53:39] might be certain methods of studying
[00:53:41] that you think uh require a little bit
[00:53:43] more
[00:53:43] concentration um whereas there are some
[00:53:46] some things like for example you could
[00:53:48] maybe spend your 9 you could you could
[00:53:50] block out 900 p.m. to 9:30 is you to
[00:53:55] just relax have some tea just you know
[00:53:59] just chill out for a little bit and then
[00:54:01] 9:30 to 10: p.m. is dedicated time for
[00:54:04] you to just review through some of the
[00:54:06] material that you've studied maybe do
[00:54:08] maybe maybe just get a blank piece of
[00:54:10] paper and just do a mind map from memory
[00:54:12] and there are lots of things that you
[00:54:13] can do in a short period of time that
[00:54:15] can prep you for more effective targeted
[00:54:18] learning when you've got more time and
[00:54:20] you're able to concentrate so here's a
[00:54:22] here's a common flow that I've used
[00:54:23] myself and it could be used useful 9:30
[00:54:26] to 10 p.m. 30 minutes you think of
[00:54:28] everything that you've learned during
[00:54:30] that week and then you just dump it just
[00:54:32] brain dump from memory you map out as
[00:54:34] much as you possibly can and anything
[00:54:36] that you feel not confident on or you're
[00:54:38] not sure about or you're forgetting you
[00:54:40] just have a separate piece of paper and
[00:54:41] you just write it down you don't have to
[00:54:43] go and study it you don't have to go and
[00:54:44] learn it but you just note down what it
[00:54:46] is that you that's weak that's weaker
[00:54:48] and you go to sleep and the next morning
[00:54:50] you've got a piece of paper that has all
[00:54:52] of your weaknesses on it right and now
[00:54:54] you know exactly where to start you can
[00:54:57] start your first study session by just
[00:54:58] going through that list because that's
[00:55:01] targeted that's focused on what you know
[00:55:03] is a weakness for you and you can spend
[00:55:05] the first 30 minutes of studying just
[00:55:07] covering some of those
[00:55:09] weaknesses right and that just means
[00:55:10] that you get into a pattern and a habit
[00:55:12] of
[00:55:13] reviewing the third thing that I think
[00:55:15] which uh which Builds on this is if cuz
[00:55:21] one of the things that you mentioned at
[00:55:22] the beginning is that you don't have any
[00:55:23] time to review because you're just
[00:55:24] spending all of your time just learning
[00:55:26] this new
[00:55:27] material normally when it comes to
[00:55:29] learning the the knowledge tends to
[00:55:31] build
[00:55:33] um with within with you know you have
[00:55:36] like a topic and then you know that that
[00:55:38] topic will kind of like the knowledge
[00:55:39] within that topic will just sort of
[00:55:40] build right so even when you're just
[00:55:42] learning new things there is a way to
[00:55:44] try to review that while you are still
[00:55:47] learning the new things and so what I
[00:55:50] think is maybe the method that you're
[00:55:51] using for learning isn't allowing you to
[00:55:53] actually build on the knowledge it might
[00:55:56] be quite kind of like
[00:55:58] isolated what I would recommend is try
[00:56:02] to probably in that focused period of
[00:56:05] time in this kind of morning block try
[00:56:09] to
[00:56:11] um like try to try to
[00:56:14] study even if it's more shallow and
[00:56:17] superficial try to study
[00:56:19] ahead so don't just follow the course or
[00:56:22] the program or something at the same
[00:56:24] pace
[00:56:25] just try to study uh like not as deep
[00:56:29] and not as detailed but just like bigger
[00:56:32] broader so that you're kind of working
[00:56:35] ahead of the content because you want to
[00:56:38] be building your knowledge in layers
[00:56:41] like
[00:56:42] this rather than in
[00:56:45] columns like this you don't want to
[00:56:48] learn deep and
[00:56:49] detailed step by step by step you want
[00:56:53] to be learning very shallow and wide and
[00:56:57] then building a little bit more detail
[00:56:59] on that and then building a little bit
[00:57:00] more detail on that and building a
[00:57:02] little bit more detail and when you
[00:57:03] learn this way it's going to be easier
[00:57:04] even if you don't have dedicated time to
[00:57:07] review what you've already learned
[00:57:09] you'll naturally review it anyway
[00:57:12] because each layer is relying on you
[00:57:14] having the knowledge from the previous
[00:57:16] underlying layer so as you get more
[00:57:19] detailed you're testing yourself on your
[00:57:21] understanding of the basic
[00:57:23] concepts this is you know this is kind
[00:57:25] of one one sort of thing that you could
[00:57:26] do so the the third thing here is to
[00:57:29] layer your
[00:57:32] learning um but it does mean that you
[00:57:34] often need to um it does mean that you
[00:57:38] often need to learn uh
[00:57:42] slightly like different to how it's
[00:57:44] being taught to you which can be you
[00:57:46] know unsettling for some people but I
[00:57:48] would I would really recommend that you
[00:57:50] experiment with this and and try to give
[00:57:51] it a go um there's one more thing that I
[00:57:54] think would will probably help you which
[00:57:56] is number four is to
[00:57:59] schedule
[00:58:05] unpredictability okay so this is kind of
[00:58:07] like a um you know it's quite a foreign
[00:58:09] concept for a lot of people think about
[00:58:12] like
[00:58:12] this unexpected things will always
[00:58:15] happen but you're not going to know what
[00:58:16] it is because they're unexpected so but
[00:58:20] you know it's going to happen you don't
[00:58:22] know what it is but you know it's going
[00:58:23] to happen so you should actually
[00:58:25] schedule for
[00:58:26] that have time in your schedule that's
[00:58:29] dedicated as just in case time just in
[00:58:33] case something happens you've got this
[00:58:35] time that you can deal with it and now
[00:58:37] it's planned for and you can plan around
[00:58:39] it now in the best case scenario nothing
[00:58:41] happens now you've got extra time and
[00:58:44] you can use that extra time for more
[00:58:45] study or whatever you want to do right
[00:58:49] to catch up to review material that's
[00:58:51] free time for you that's time that
[00:58:52] you've created you can use that however
[00:58:53] you want but in the worst case scenario
[00:58:56] something does come up and what you're
[00:58:57] saying is that 50 50% of the time
[00:58:59] there's something not unpredictable
[00:59:01] that's
[00:59:02] happening now you've got a dedicated
[00:59:04] time that you can use to try to deal
[00:59:07] with it or deal with it as much as
[00:59:08] possible and maybe that amount of time
[00:59:10] is not enough but at least it's it's
[00:59:12] better than not having anticipated at
[00:59:14] all it's just going to reduce the impact
[00:59:15] that it has so your consistency may not
[00:59:17] be 100% every single day when an
[00:59:20] unpredictable thing happens though it
[00:59:22] means that it's not going to just it's
[00:59:23] it's not going to go to zero it's going
[00:59:25] to at least be 50% 60% you can maintain
[00:59:29] at least some baseline level of
[00:59:31] consistency because you're scheduling in
[00:59:33] a buffer you're scheduling in a cushion
[00:59:35] in case things go
[00:59:37] wrong okay so there's already quite a
[00:59:40] few things there um but obviously the it
[00:59:43] starts with actually having a written
[00:59:45] schedule I would really strongly
[00:59:47] recommend having a schedule that um you
[00:59:51] know is like you're committing to paper
[00:59:53] with actual um dates if you I personally
[00:59:55] use like Google Calendar because it's
[00:59:57] just easy to easy to use you can use
[00:59:59] paper you can use an app whatever you
[01:00:01] you're comfortable with but actually
[01:00:03] have it track the amount of time that
[01:00:06] you're taking get a realistic
[01:00:08] understanding of how you're spending
[01:00:10] your time and how long certain things
[01:00:12] take you and once you're able to really
[01:00:15] understand how long certain things take
[01:00:16] you you can then start scheduling things
[01:00:18] in advance anticipating how long things
[01:00:21] will take and then allocating your time
[01:00:23] a little bit more strategic ially by
[01:00:25] using these four little uh tips that
[01:00:29] I've given you again for you to
[01:00:30] experiment with okay based on um what
[01:00:35] I've told you here are there any
[01:00:38] particular parts that stick out to you H
[01:00:41] you know that you're not certain
[01:00:44] about no pretty straightforward okay
[01:00:47] give that a go what I'm going to do is
[01:00:49] I'm going to say okay Janelle if you're
[01:00:51] still there if you thought of any other
[01:00:53] questions dur during that
[01:00:56] time
[01:00:58] um if you guys have any questions at all
[01:01:02] then we'll we'll open up to that hold on
[01:01:04] I want to just try to
[01:01:10] do yeah any any any other kind of
[01:01:13] miscellaneous
[01:01:16] questions uh yeah I had a another
[01:01:19] question just like about the mind maps
[01:01:22] oh sometimes I do get like I get like a
[01:01:24] decent mind map like I get a decent
[01:01:26] skeleton but I have a I actually have
[01:01:29] like a lot of just incomplete mind maps
[01:01:32] I mentioned that like in the form like I
[01:01:34] have a bunch of mind maps and they're
[01:01:35] kind of scattered in my
[01:01:38] iPad but right now I'm just wondering
[01:01:42] like how the revision process goes for
[01:01:45] like the Mind map like you do the Mind
[01:01:47] map and then the next day like how that
[01:01:50] works filling in all those
[01:01:53] blanks uh
[01:01:55] yeah it kind of depends so um are your
[01:01:58] mind maps that are incomplete on like
[01:02:00] single lectures or are they on like
[01:02:02] entire
[01:02:03] topics um like I have this one mind map
[01:02:08] of the
[01:02:10] um right now I have this one mind map
[01:02:13] it's an entire topic it's just about
[01:02:16] the um it's just about the
[01:02:19] cell and all the
[01:02:22] different components
[01:02:25] how how incomplete are we talking like
[01:02:27] let's you know what percentage complete
[01:02:28] is
[01:02:30] it probably like if I look at this
[01:02:33] slides maybe like
[01:02:35] 30% is left
[01:02:38] over 30% left over okay so actually not
[01:02:41] yeah okay so if if that's the case um I
[01:02:44] think probably okay as a general
[01:02:47] principle if you've got my maps that are
[01:02:49] incomplete it's actually worthwhile just
[01:02:51] using your revision session to just
[01:02:53] complete them
[01:02:55] um yeah and and clean them up so the
[01:02:58] reason is because when the it's not it's
[01:03:01] not about whether you complete the Mind
[01:03:02] map or not it's about the type of
[01:03:04] thinking that doing the Mind map and
[01:03:07] doing it correctly not just like doing a
[01:03:08] mind map but like the thinking process
[01:03:10] that is involved in it it's about the
[01:03:12] type of learning that that helps to
[01:03:15] facilitate um so for for a lot of people
[01:03:18] that are just starting into that higher
[01:03:19] order um learning space the Mind map is
[01:03:22] their vehicle to trigger that higher
[01:03:24] order learning and the thinking process
[01:03:26] that's involved in creating that mind
[01:03:28] map is what allows you know that that
[01:03:31] higher order knowledge to be formed so
[01:03:33] you don't really want to avoid that even
[01:03:35] if you're doing it late or you know
[01:03:37] whatever it is like you want to have
[01:03:38] that happening at some point during your
[01:03:41] learning um if you weren't able to get
[01:03:44] onto it earlier that knowledge is
[01:03:47] probably not there anyway and you need
[01:03:50] to have that knowledge formed so it
[01:03:52] still makes sense to do it as part of
[01:03:54] your revision
[01:03:56] session this changes if you have other
[01:03:58] methods that you're using to to pad up
[01:04:00] your higher order learning though so if
[01:04:02] my maps are just one thing but actually
[01:04:04] you you've got a lot of higher order
[01:04:05] learning happening through another
[01:04:06] method that you're using as well then
[01:04:09] that changes things a little bit but
[01:04:10] based on what you have said I think the
[01:04:12] Mind map is kind of the primary vehicle
[01:04:14] for you to engage in higher order
[01:04:15] learning right yeah yeah so in that case
[01:04:19] you're probably going to have higher
[01:04:20] order learning gaps by not having
[01:04:21] completed it so whether you do that in
[01:04:23] the prese stud or whether you do that in
[01:04:25] your main learning event or whether you
[01:04:26] do that in your you know in your
[01:04:28] retrieval kind of like doesn't really
[01:04:31] make much of a difference you just got
[01:04:32] to do it at some point anyway you may as
[01:04:34] well just do it as part of your as part
[01:04:37] of your
[01:04:39] revision okay
[01:04:41] yeah yeah did that answer your question
[01:04:45] uh yeah yeah it did cool okay any other
[01:04:53] questions Sona any questions from you as
[01:04:57] well uh yeah it is not about my
[01:05:00] struggles but I want to ask you that how
[01:05:03] I can help uh my kids or some other
[01:05:06] children so that uh they can learn they
[01:05:10] can study yeah so uh my advice for any
[01:05:15] parent um and I actually had a I
[01:05:17] actually had a podcast uh recently not
[01:05:20] not my podcast I was invited as a guest
[01:05:21] onto onto a podcast I think it's coming
[01:05:23] out in a maybe a couple months so I'd
[01:05:25] really recommend watching that podcast I
[01:05:28] I'll post it on all my social media and
[01:05:30] whatever when it is released but the
[01:05:33] most important thing is to understand
[01:05:37] that the achievements of your child when
[01:05:41] they're young don't really
[01:05:44] matter um what's important is the
[01:05:47] mindset and the attributes and the
[01:05:49] person that that is
[01:05:52] building for the challenges that that
[01:05:54] they will face later in life and one of
[01:05:57] the things that I see a lot is that
[01:05:58] what's overemphasized is the actual
[01:06:00] outcome and achievement in these early
[01:06:03] you know years like you did you say your
[01:06:05] kids are 8 years
[01:06:07] old um my uh daughter is 11 and my son
[01:06:12] is seven 11 and seven yeah so definitely
[01:06:15] seven yeah pretty pretty young 11 also
[01:06:17] you know still very young
[01:06:20] so the um the worst thing that we can do
[01:06:24] is really emphasize like achievement
[01:06:26] like getting the certain you know
[01:06:28] particular outcome because when you're
[01:06:29] young you don't actually have enough
[01:06:31] Nuance to understand what it means for
[01:06:35] for for an outcome to be achieved or for
[01:06:37] it to be difficult or for the process
[01:06:39] involved in it like all the things that
[01:06:40] we're talking about right now this is
[01:06:42] too advanced for like a young child to
[01:06:44] really understand what they understand
[01:06:47] is
[01:06:49] outcome and um
[01:06:53] acceptance
[01:06:54] so if a child starts thinking my parent
[01:06:59] only is proud of me accepts me only
[01:07:02] cares about when I do well then what
[01:07:06] create what that creates is a sense of
[01:07:08] identity that is essentially based on
[01:07:11] achieving a certain
[01:07:13] outcome and again because they're too
[01:07:16] young to really like understand the
[01:07:18] Nuance what that means is that it
[01:07:20] doesn't create a child that's driven to
[01:07:22] succeed it does the opposite it creates
[01:07:26] a child that is terrified of
[01:07:29] failing which means that they will NE
[01:07:31] they they they avoid mistakes they avoid
[01:07:33] experimentation they avoid growth
[01:07:36] because that means that they may make a
[01:07:37] mistake they avoid challenges because if
[01:07:39] it's challenging they might fail and if
[01:07:42] they fail they will not be loved they
[01:07:44] will not be accepted they're not a
[01:07:46] worthwhile human being uh and then they
[01:07:48] feel they they feel that their entire
[01:07:49] self-worth is based on being a high
[01:07:52] achiever achieving a certain out come
[01:07:54] and that is completely limiting for
[01:07:58] growth and for life that method of
[01:07:59] thinking is not compatible with a
[01:08:04] healthy uh healthy and thriving and
[01:08:06] successful life right because that
[01:08:09] mistake and failure is is Paramount so
[01:08:12] what is the way that you could help
[01:08:14] other people your children other
[01:08:16] children uh be successful
[01:08:20] academically is actually to stop
[01:08:24] focusing on the helping them with the
[01:08:27] studying what we need to help them with
[01:08:29] is the stuff that I was talking uh
[01:08:30] talking about before with Janelle is
[01:08:32] help help them see learning as a process
[01:08:34] of problem solving and making mistakes
[01:08:36] help them see the value and the mistakes
[01:08:38] that they're making see the value in
[01:08:40] thinking about a process and
[01:08:42] understanding why things happen and how
[01:08:44] we can
[01:08:45] control why things happen create a sense
[01:08:48] of identity that takes pride and
[01:08:50] ownership and being a person that
[01:08:52] figures things out and isn't afraid to
[01:08:54] make mistakes when everyone else is and
[01:08:57] then that child will grow into an adult
[01:09:00] that can just tackle
[01:09:02] anything right that would be that that's
[01:09:05] my biggest you know biggest thing that's
[01:09:08] the that's the message that I tell
[01:09:09] parents all the time and it's a message
[01:09:10] that I'll always continue to tell tell
[01:09:12] tell parents
[01:09:14] forever yeah that's a good question and
[01:09:17] I think that's probably the all the time
[01:09:19] that we've got for this session Sonia
[01:09:23] and Janelle thank you very much for
[01:09:25] coming on and and participating in this
[01:09:27] it was like super last minute literally
[01:09:29] like hours before we went live we were
[01:09:31] just like yo can you can you come on uh
[01:09:33] so thank you for um being willing to do
[01:09:36] that it's very brave and it's very
[01:09:38] generous to be on a live stream you know
[01:09:42] on a on a channel and talk about some of
[01:09:43] the difficulties and your struggles I
[01:09:45] know that most people would not be you
[01:09:48] know brave enough and um be willing to
[01:09:51] to do that so everyone in the chat
[01:09:53] please you know say thank you leave your
[01:09:56] appreciation for son and Janelle um
[01:09:59] we'll wrap that up there thanks everyone
[01:10:01] for watching I hope this has been
[01:10:03] informative for you please again it's
[01:10:05] not about Sonia and Janelle's problems
[01:10:07] for you obviously think about the way
[01:10:09] that I'm dissecting things there's a few
[01:10:11] things here I'm always thinking about
[01:10:12] the root cause I'm always trying to get
[01:10:14] to the bottom of why certain problems
[01:10:16] exist um you can never fix anything if
[01:10:18] you don't know exactly why it's
[01:10:19] happening so I'm trying my hardest to
[01:10:21] characterize it and get all that
[01:10:23] information out um and you have that
[01:10:25] information in your own you know in your
[01:10:28] own reflection so just get into that
[01:10:29] habit of reflecting and trying to
[01:10:31] diagnose your own problems and
[01:10:32] experimenting with Solutions thank you
[01:10:34] all for tuning in um and we'll we'll end
[01:10:37] it there if I can figure out how to end
[01:10:39] the
[01:10:40] stream which seems to be this so thanks
[01:10:43] everyone see you
[01:10:48] later and I think


=== Normal goal setting VS Reverse goal setting ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9JA0TqYP3o

[00:00:00] the idea with normal goal setting is we
[00:00:02] say where are we now where do we want to
[00:00:05] get to and then how do we go from where
[00:00:07] we are now to where we want to get to
[00:00:10] it's very logical and there's nothing
[00:00:11] inherently wrong with this but it can be
[00:00:14] complicated when your goal is very
[00:00:17] long-term or very complex and it's
[00:00:18] actually unclear how you can actually
[00:00:21] get to where you want to go from where
[00:00:23] you are and these are the types of
[00:00:24] situations where reverse goal setting
[00:00:26] really shines


=== What can we learn from a digital artist? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4VQGsdOZJ0

[00:00:00] you guys know people yeah the artist the
[00:00:01] artist he got real famous recently for
[00:00:03] selling like the first yeah yeah it has
[00:00:06] uploaded like a piece of art like every
[00:00:07] single day like last 13 14 years like
[00:00:09] every single day and he never stockpiles
[00:00:11] he never makes this material in advance
[00:00:12] he does it every single day and he's
[00:00:14] never missed a day and what he said it
[00:00:16] was like he only spends 45 minutes to an
[00:00:17] hour every day and he doesn't spend
[00:00:19] longer than that and he just does the
[00:00:20] best possible effort in that time he's
[00:00:22] not worried about making a masterpiece
[00:00:23] he's worried about getting the best
[00:00:25] possible thing in that amount of time
[00:00:26] that's available and he's seeing his
[00:00:28] work as not that single piece but the
[00:00:30] collection of all of his pieces and I
[00:00:32] think that kind of approach if you're
[00:00:33] like a perfectionist it's not about
[00:00:35] getting the perfect product necessarily
[00:00:37] it's about getting the perfect kind of
[00:00:38] package like the Total Image and that
[00:00:40] sometimes what that means is you just do
[00:00:42] your best and the time available rather
[00:00:43] than just trying to smash everything out
[00:00:45] to the Perfection every single time yeah
[00:00:46] minimum viable effort yeah


=== What happens when research papers are retracted? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f9cg7TJSEI

[00:00:00] so there's a website called retraction
[00:00:02] watch and they're doing good work
[00:00:03] they're doing important work but it is
[00:00:05] amazing like nothing happened after a
[00:00:08] paper is retracted literally nothing and
[00:00:10] so sometimes because of the extra bump
[00:00:12] in publicity that a paper gets from
[00:00:14] being retracted it's actually cited more
[00:00:16] often for the thing that is you know
[00:00:19] there are problems with it and this
[00:00:21] you're really trying to look for the
[00:00:23] fact that it's retracted or not it's
[00:00:24] easy to miss it especially a lot of the
[00:00:26] sites that will index it and they just
[00:00:28] have the PDF so when you click to it
[00:00:29] you're going straight to the PDF but
[00:00:31] then it's like that PDF was actually
[00:00:32] uploaded on a personal blog or something
[00:00:34] of the author because it was retracted
[00:00:37] from you know maybe like a publicly
[00:00:38] available database or some other kind


=== Don't waste your time on manifestation ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNoJzMq708g

[00:00:00] manifestation
[00:00:01] I feel like I'm going to get hated on by
[00:00:03] like every single um Tick Tock Instagram
[00:00:07] um and I don't even know what you call
[00:00:09] them they're just influencers for the
[00:00:10] sake of influencing
[00:00:12] um but I think it's like super overrated
[00:00:14] I don't want the benefit of like all
[00:00:16] this manifestation stuff that is better
[00:00:19] than just doing like proper goal setting
[00:00:20] and planning you get all the benefits
[00:00:22] you know it allows you to like focus in
[00:00:24] and centralize in and visualize where
[00:00:26] you want to go and think about it
[00:00:28] critically and then and make sure that
[00:00:29] everything is aligned to it but at least
[00:00:31] in that when you do proper goal setting
[00:00:33] and planning for it you're actually
[00:00:35] aligning your actions and behavior for
[00:00:37] it as well whereas manifestation can be
[00:00:39] Broad and some people are like literally
[00:00:41] thinking they can manifest anything by
[00:00:43] just like speaking it into the universe
[00:00:46] well let's do this you speak into the
[00:00:48] universe I'll do things we'll meet up in
[00:00:50] 10 years and see where we got okay let's
[00:00:52] just empirically test it


=== Don't give your future self more work to do. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_GGP0Es0K4

[00:00:00] the future version of you is probably
[00:00:02] going to be just as busy or busier than
[00:00:06] you are now don't give the future
[00:00:09] version of you more work to do I've seen
[00:00:12] this time and time again with the
[00:00:13] students that I work with students that
[00:00:14] have these great systems getting them
[00:00:16] good results in the short term but
[00:00:18] they're not preparing themselves for the
[00:00:19] challenges of next year or the year
[00:00:21] after that and they eventually just get
[00:00:22] more and more overwhelmed every year
[00:00:25] until one day it's just not good enough
[00:00:27] and something breaks and then at that
[00:00:28] point they're trapped like I was without
[00:00:31] any time to make any changes once I
[00:00:33] realize how bad learning debt was I had
[00:00:36] to do a complete reset of how I was
[00:00:37] studying so now I'm always making sure
[00:00:40] that I invest that effort in upfront as
[00:00:43] early as I can to build that knowledge
[00:00:45] as quickly as I can to make the future
[00:00:47] version of myself have an easier time of
[00:00:49] handling that knowledge


=== Why studying does not equate to learning? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJHZV8-3GXM

[00:00:00] I'm always talking about how studying is
[00:00:02] not learning studying is what we do but
[00:00:05] learning is what happens in our brain
[00:00:06] you wouldn't say you learn unless that
[00:00:08] time spent studying helped the
[00:00:10] information become part of your
[00:00:12] knowledge and stay in your memory so
[00:00:13] that you can use it studying only leads
[00:00:16] to learning when number one the
[00:00:18] information is encoded into your memory
[00:00:20] and number two you can actually use that
[00:00:22] knowledge through retrieval if you're
[00:00:24] not able to do that then all you've done
[00:00:25] is spend time on doing this random thing
[00:00:27] called studying which hasn't led to
[00:00:28] learning


=== If a student displays this, it's a red flag! ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92bjFiDPpGE

[00:00:00] if someone displays this it is a red
[00:00:02] flag like this is a harsh limitation to
[00:00:05] them being able to improve is people
[00:00:07] that are not open-minded but not
[00:00:09] open-minded in a very specific way
[00:00:11] they're not open-minded about their own
[00:00:14] beliefs and assumptions and conclusions
[00:00:16] that they make about themselves and
[00:00:18] their ability so people that think that
[00:00:21] they are you know good at a certain
[00:00:22] thing and you may be good at that thing
[00:00:23] however I think the Hallmark of someone
[00:00:25] that's actually successful is that they
[00:00:27] can truly entertain the idea and
[00:00:29] seriously consider the thought that
[00:00:31] maybe they're not that they could be
[00:00:33] wrong


=== Don't overdose on learning techniques ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlborvQUQs8

[00:00:00] so one of my first major realizations
[00:00:02] was that you can kind of overdose on
[00:00:05] learning techniques in medicine there is
[00:00:07] this concept of a therapeutic index and
[00:00:10] it goes like this a therapeutic index is
[00:00:13] the dose range at which that medication
[00:00:15] is effective for example if you've got
[00:00:16] pain you can take painkillers if you
[00:00:19] take too little it's not going to be
[00:00:20] enough if you take too much it can be
[00:00:23] very dangerous and you might even die so
[00:00:26] there's a range in which it's effective
[00:00:28] and it's doing good for you if you go
[00:00:31] outside of that range it becomes either
[00:00:33] unhelpful or it can become even harmful
[00:00:35] so this is when I realized that a
[00:00:37] technique can be helpful but if you use
[00:00:39] it too much it can actually harm you in
[00:00:41] the long run


=== 10,000 Hours of No-BS Study Advice in 14 Minutes ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2Ogza-n3i0

[00:00:00] so I only really seriously started
[00:00:02] studying when I was 17 trying to enter
[00:00:04] into medical school since then I have
[00:00:06] studied easily over 10 000 hours I've
[00:00:10] studied medicine I've studied education
[00:00:12] learning science Computing marketing
[00:00:15] business accounting all sorts of
[00:00:17] different things and for the first five
[00:00:19] or six years of studying I probably
[00:00:21] spent twice the amount of time that I
[00:00:25] needed to I have made more mistakes than
[00:00:27] most but I have learned from them in
[00:00:30] this video I want to share three of the
[00:00:33] most mind-blowing realizations that I
[00:00:35] had around studying each of these
[00:00:37] realizations resulted in me making
[00:00:39] massive improvements to my learning
[00:00:41] ability and make sure to stick around
[00:00:42] because the last realization alone
[00:00:44] probably accounted for at least 80
[00:00:47] percent of all of the wasted time over
[00:00:50] the years and the changes I made because
[00:00:52] of it are what allowed me to eventually
[00:00:54] become a top scholar if you're new to
[00:00:56] the channel welcome I'm Dr Justin sung
[00:00:58] I'm a full-time learning coach and
[00:00:59] learning researcher I'm also the head of
[00:01:01] learning and I can study and a former
[00:01:03] medical doctor over the last decade I've
[00:01:04] worked with tens of thousands of people
[00:01:05] from around the world to help them learn
[00:01:07] more efficiently before we jump in I'd
[00:01:09] appreciate if you can give this video a
[00:01:10] like
[00:01:11] to help with the algorithm so one of my
[00:01:13] first major realizations was that you
[00:01:16] can kind of overdose on learning
[00:01:18] techniques let me explain in medicine
[00:01:21] there is this concept of a therapeutic
[00:01:23] index and it goes like this a
[00:01:25] therapeutic index is the dose range at
[00:01:28] which that medication is effective for
[00:01:30] example if you've got pain you can take
[00:01:31] painkillers if you take too little it's
[00:01:33] not going to be enough if you take too
[00:01:35] much it can be very dangerous you might
[00:01:38] even die so there's a range in which
[00:01:41] it's effective and it's doing good for
[00:01:43] you if you go outside of that range it
[00:01:46] becomes either unhelpful or it can
[00:01:48] become even harmful now when I was 17 I
[00:01:51] discovered flashcards for the first time
[00:01:53] and it was magical one of my friends was
[00:01:56] doing really well and they said hey this
[00:01:57] is a technique I use I tried it and I
[00:01:59] loved it and I went all in on it I had
[00:02:02] thousands of flash cards and honestly a
[00:02:04] lot of the results that I got in my
[00:02:05] first year of uni were because I was so
[00:02:07] heavily involved in my flashcards so it
[00:02:09] was working well what's the problem the
[00:02:12] problem was that it wasn't sustainable
[00:02:13] and when I got into medical school I had
[00:02:16] so many flashcards that I was getting
[00:02:17] overwhelmed I didn't have time to finish
[00:02:19] them all and it also wasn't enough I
[00:02:21] wasn't being able to think in the way
[00:02:23] that I needed to think yes I could
[00:02:25] recall the facts but I couldn't use the
[00:02:26] knowledge properly so how does this
[00:02:28] relate to overdosing well the thing is
[00:02:30] because I had so many flashcards and I
[00:02:33] was spending so much time just getting
[00:02:34] through them it was taking time away for
[00:02:37] me to invest in learning about other
[00:02:39] methods that I could use or
[00:02:40] experimenting I basically trapped myself
[00:02:42] I needed to change my methods but I was
[00:02:45] spending so much time with my current
[00:02:47] methods I didn't have time to change
[00:02:49] them so this is when I realized that a
[00:02:51] technique can be helpful but if you use
[00:02:53] it too much it can actually harm you in
[00:02:55] the long run so what did I do
[00:02:57] differently I started making
[00:02:59] tiny tiny adjustments to how I study
[00:03:02] every two or three days I would
[00:03:04] experiment with a small change where the
[00:03:07] consequence of getting it wrong was very
[00:03:09] very small and then I'd reflect on how
[00:03:11] it's been been going and how I felt
[00:03:13] about it across the next two or three
[00:03:14] days so that eventually I was able to
[00:03:17] rely on flashcards less and less I knew
[00:03:20] that what I was doing right now wasn't
[00:03:21] sustainable I knew I had to make some
[00:03:22] kind of change and I knew I wasn't going
[00:03:24] to be able to completely remove myself
[00:03:26] from the current system that I'd build
[00:03:28] straight away so I made sure to take
[00:03:30] very very very small steps and the
[00:03:32] benefit of this was number one obviously
[00:03:34] that I eventually I was able to escape
[00:03:36] that but number two is that I got really
[00:03:38] really in tune with the effect that my
[00:03:40] studying was having I'm always talking
[00:03:42] about how studying is not learning
[00:03:45] studying is what we do but learning is
[00:03:47] what happens in our brain you wouldn't
[00:03:48] say you learned unless that time spent
[00:03:50] studying helped the information become
[00:03:53] part of your knowledge and stay in your
[00:03:55] memory so that you can use it studying
[00:03:57] only leads to learning when number one
[00:03:59] the information is encoded into your
[00:04:02] memory and number two you can actually
[00:04:03] use that knowledge through retrieval if
[00:04:05] you're not able to do that then all
[00:04:07] you've done is spend time on doing this
[00:04:08] random thing called studying which
[00:04:10] hasn't led to learning and by doing this
[00:04:11] process of reviewing and making these
[00:04:13] very frequent adjustments to my process
[00:04:16] I was able to be much clearer in terms
[00:04:18] of what I'm spending my time doing and
[00:04:21] the impact that I was having on my
[00:04:23] memory and the quality of my learning
[00:04:25] Not only was I able to remove my
[00:04:27] dependence and over-reliance on
[00:04:29] flashcards but also I started seeing
[00:04:30] that a lot of other things that I was
[00:04:31] doing with my studying were problematic
[00:04:33] as well and that's a story for another
[00:04:35] video now I know a lot of students find
[00:04:38] this process very daunting they've got
[00:04:40] the system that they're really
[00:04:41] comfortable with and there's level of
[00:04:43] insecurity or uncertainty around
[00:04:45] changing this me personally I actually
[00:04:47] really enjoyed experimenting in the
[00:04:49] process of actually upgrading myself but
[00:04:51] the key is to change things gradually
[00:04:54] don't just take away all of your flash
[00:04:56] cards and leave a gaping void because
[00:04:58] otherwise you're going to have nothing
[00:04:59] to fill it for example I currently right
[00:05:02] now have a gaping void in my self-esteem
[00:05:04] that can only be filled by you liking
[00:05:07] and subscribing
[00:05:09] so let's fast forward I made all of
[00:05:11] these changes and eventually I became a
[00:05:13] super learner right no wrong I had some
[00:05:17] other issues which brings me to my
[00:05:18] second realization don't create learning
[00:05:22] debt yes learning debt and I'm not
[00:05:25] talking about a student loan here by the
[00:05:27] time I was on my fourth year of
[00:05:28] University I was entering into Hospital
[00:05:30] attachments and I was a pretty decent
[00:05:32] student I had already decided that a
[00:05:34] plus wasn't where I wanted to spend my
[00:05:36] time because I was getting really
[00:05:37] involved in teaching and education by
[00:05:39] that point so I was getting sort of A's
[00:05:41] and a minuses and feeling fairly
[00:05:44] confident to hit the wards and then I
[00:05:45] had my very first attachment which was
[00:05:47] General medicine or internal medicine
[00:05:48] for those of you in the states and then
[00:05:50] I failed I failed my first attachment
[00:05:52] and I know this because my boss told me
[00:05:54] directly I had the knowledge but I just
[00:05:58] did not know how to use it and the right
[00:06:00] way to work with real patients the way
[00:06:03] that I had stored and organized that
[00:06:05] information was set for my exams not the
[00:06:09] real world and what's even worse is that
[00:06:12] because I've been studying for these
[00:06:14] exams a lot of the times after the exams
[00:06:16] I would forget like most of what I had
[00:06:18] studied and so what ended up happening
[00:06:20] is that I would come home from the
[00:06:21] hospital during my placements and I'd
[00:06:23] spend my evening spending hours studying
[00:06:25] most of the time just relearning the
[00:06:28] stuff that I'd learned from you know
[00:06:30] going through med school I'd go through
[00:06:32] my old med school notes and just
[00:06:33] re-remember the stuff that I'd already
[00:06:35] studied and then try to make sense of it
[00:06:37] again in a more useful way and I
[00:06:40] remember thinking to myself why did I
[00:06:43] not just learn it the right way to begin
[00:06:46] with I would have saved so much time
[00:06:47] this is what I mean by learning debt the
[00:06:51] methods I'd used in the past were fine
[00:06:53] for my present needs but they created
[00:06:56] problems for my future self which meant
[00:07:00] that now I had to spend extra time to
[00:07:02] relearn things properly while also
[00:07:05] having to learn new material too I was
[00:07:08] hit with a double burden of work so one
[00:07:11] thing I've realized which I always tell
[00:07:13] to my students now is that the future
[00:07:15] version of you is probably going to be
[00:07:17] just as busy or busier than you are now
[00:07:21] don't give the future version of you
[00:07:24] more work to do it is worth it to do it
[00:07:28] right the first time and even outside of
[00:07:30] medicine I've seen this time and time
[00:07:31] again with the students that I work with
[00:07:33] students that have these great systems
[00:07:34] getting them good results in the short
[00:07:36] term but they're not preparing
[00:07:37] themselves for the challenges of next
[00:07:39] year or the year after that and they
[00:07:40] eventually just get more and more
[00:07:42] overwhelmed every year until one day
[00:07:44] it's just not good enough and something
[00:07:46] breaks and then at that point they're
[00:07:47] trapped like I was without any time to
[00:07:50] make any changes once I realize how bad
[00:07:52] learning debt was I had to do a complete
[00:07:55] reset of how I was studying luckily I
[00:07:57] was already used to experimenting with
[00:07:58] my Methods at the time so it wasn't too
[00:08:00] bad but these are the steps that I teach
[00:08:02] my students now when they're in the same
[00:08:04] position
[00:08:04] number one identify your retrieval needs
[00:08:09] what do you need to know how do you need
[00:08:11] to know and think about it and how long
[00:08:14] do you need to know it for how do you
[00:08:16] need to use that knowledge not just
[00:08:18] immediately but in the future number two
[00:08:21] map your current learning process what
[00:08:24] do you do when information comes in
[00:08:26] start there then what do you do with it
[00:08:28] what methods are you using how are you
[00:08:29] thinking about it if you've never really
[00:08:31] thought about how you learned before
[00:08:33] this step can be actually quite
[00:08:34] challenging you might have to spend a
[00:08:36] few days actually observing how you
[00:08:38] study to actually map it all out and
[00:08:40] that's actually a really good thing
[00:08:41] because it means that you're starting
[00:08:43] the first step to making some serious
[00:08:45] improvements number three challenge your
[00:08:48] reasoning why do you use the methods and
[00:08:51] processes that you use does the method
[00:08:53] and process you're using allow you to
[00:08:56] achieve the retrieval needs that you've
[00:08:58] identified do you even know do you even
[00:09:00] know why you're using the methods that
[00:09:01] you're using or is it just out of habit
[00:09:03] or because all of your friends are doing
[00:09:04] it ask yourself whether this process is
[00:09:07] going to help you to reach your goals in
[00:09:09] terms of what you need to know how you
[00:09:10] need to know it and how long you need to
[00:09:12] know it for and again you may not know
[00:09:13] you may do this step and find that
[00:09:16] you're drawing blanks and that's fine
[00:09:17] it's just about learning a little bit
[00:09:19] more but it's an important step to start
[00:09:21] mapping out whether you're actually
[00:09:22] spending your time in a productive way
[00:09:24] and watching some of my other videos is
[00:09:25] going to help you learn some of that
[00:09:26] fundamental Theory as well number four
[00:09:28] learn and experiment learn about how
[00:09:31] Learning Works experiment make some
[00:09:34] gradual changes like they talked about
[00:09:36] in my first realization take it slow and
[00:09:39] gradually try to upgrade your system
[00:09:40] before I realize this yes I was
[00:09:43] experimenting but I didn't have the
[00:09:45] right goal so a lot of that time that I
[00:09:47] spent on experimenting reflecting was
[00:09:49] sort of wasted now learning is seriously
[00:09:51] very complicated and I can't tell you
[00:09:53] exactly every single process that you
[00:09:55] need to use for your goals and in fact
[00:09:56] it's kind of impossible because it
[00:09:57] depends on what your strengths and
[00:09:59] weaknesses are and what your goals are
[00:10:00] and what your situation is the right
[00:10:02] process for you is going to be different
[00:10:03] for the right process from someone else
[00:10:04] but what does remain true through tend
[00:10:07] to be the principles of effective
[00:10:09] learning even if the flavor is a little
[00:10:11] bit different the principles usually in
[00:10:14] every single instance have to be adhered
[00:10:16] to and the videos that I upload on my
[00:10:18] channel generally are focused on the
[00:10:19] principles I want you to know what the
[00:10:22] principles are so you can go and craft
[00:10:23] your own learning process because it's
[00:10:24] just not possible for me to tell you
[00:10:26] everything that you need to do step by
[00:10:28] step it doesn't work that way and one of
[00:10:30] the most important principles which I
[00:10:32] realized embarrassingly late in my kind
[00:10:35] of learning life I guess was that you
[00:10:38] cannot get stronger without lifting the
[00:10:41] weight maybe because I was just a really
[00:10:43] busy person with medical school and
[00:10:45] running my non-profit and doing my
[00:10:47] teaching and all of that but I was
[00:10:48] pretty obsessed with efficiency you can
[00:10:51] probably tell I kind of still am but as
[00:10:53] a result of that I always looked for the
[00:10:56] faster and easier less effortful way of
[00:11:00] doing things like I was always tired I
[00:11:01] wanted to spend less effort on things if
[00:11:03] I could so I would look through all of
[00:11:05] these learning techniques makes and
[00:11:06] learning systems and I spent really many
[00:11:08] hours across years experimenting with
[00:11:11] methods that were meant to make learning
[00:11:13] easier and faster for me which seems
[00:11:16] perfectly logical but I realized that
[00:11:19] that was actually sabotaging me let me
[00:11:22] put it this way the best way to make
[00:11:24] learning easier for you in the long run
[00:11:26] is to actually just be an expert at the
[00:11:29] topic the more you know the more
[00:11:31] connections that you have to work with
[00:11:34] the more you can make sense of new
[00:11:35] information because you've got more
[00:11:36] things to connect it to and to do that
[00:11:38] you need to a know things about that
[00:11:42] subject and B know how to use what you
[00:11:47] know to make sense of new information
[00:11:50] which is a skill the thing about
[00:11:52] learning especially higher order
[00:11:53] learning which is the type of learning
[00:11:55] that builds these networks and
[00:11:56] connections is that it requires mental
[00:11:58] effort it's like trying to lift away
[00:12:00] just by staring at it it's not gonna
[00:12:03] work and by trying to make learning
[00:12:05] easier and less effortful what you're
[00:12:07] actually trying to do there is remove
[00:12:10] your brains need to process the
[00:12:13] information you're taking the brain out
[00:12:15] of the equation and you cannot build
[00:12:17] knowledge in your mind when you remove
[00:12:19] your mind
[00:12:21] building high quality knowledge takes
[00:12:23] effort it's actually called desirable
[00:12:25] difficulty and as you spend the right
[00:12:28] effort in the right way you're able to
[00:12:30] learn more build expertise and then as
[00:12:33] your expertise grows it becomes easier
[00:12:36] and easier to learn more new information
[00:12:39] is less new because there are so many
[00:12:42] more anchor points of prior knowledge
[00:12:44] that you can actually connect to and
[00:12:46] make sense out of it's like doing a
[00:12:48] jigsaw puzzle as you complete it it's
[00:12:50] easier to see how the remaining pieces
[00:12:53] fit in but if you avoid the effort and
[00:12:55] you're just trying to make it faster and
[00:12:56] easier and you're not thinking about how
[00:12:58] to spend the right effort in the right
[00:12:59] way and that makes you learn things in
[00:13:01] isolation or just memorize things
[00:13:03] superficially using whatever apps or
[00:13:04] software like I spent a lot of time
[00:13:06] trying to do then it makes it harder
[00:13:08] because it's harder to build those
[00:13:10] connections it's kind of like trying to
[00:13:12] solve a jigsaw puzzle by just seeing all
[00:13:13] the pieces scattered on the floor and
[00:13:15] just like looking at it waiting for you
[00:13:16] to magically just see how it fits
[00:13:18] together so now I'm always making sure
[00:13:20] that I invest that effort in up front as
[00:13:24] early as I can to build that knowledge
[00:13:25] as quickly as I can to make the future
[00:13:27] version of myself have an easier time of
[00:13:30] handling that knowledge not only am I
[00:13:32] not creating learning debt I'm actually
[00:13:34] building myself a learning asset that
[00:13:36] continues to give myself rewards over
[00:13:39] time so if you want to learn a little
[00:13:41] bit more around the specific methods
[00:13:43] that you can use to try to build this
[00:13:45] high quality knowledge then a good place
[00:13:46] to start might be a big picture overview
[00:13:48] of how I structured my learning system
[00:13:50] for when I ranked first at Monash for my
[00:13:53] Masters or if you've got time there's
[00:13:55] this playlist you can check out which
[00:13:56] goes through the foundations of
[00:13:58] efficient learning it's a good place to
[00:13:59] start make sure to like this video

=== DON'T fall into this goal setting trap ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pishuorM0D8

[00:00:00] this is a trap and a lot of people fall
[00:00:01] into in their goal setting is that they
[00:00:03] think well I intend to get better but
[00:00:05] they don't really have a mechanism for
[00:00:07] how that Improvement is going to take
[00:00:09] place learn how to improve otherwise you
[00:00:13] really can't plan for anything you're
[00:00:15] not going to be able to make an estimate
[00:00:16] of how long it's going to take you
[00:00:17] you'll only be left with an intention
[00:00:19] time passing does nothing it's what we
[00:00:21] do in that time that matters


=== Should studytubers provide citations? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-sDaYPX3lU

[00:00:00] I generally am think citations are
[00:00:02] important but the problem is there's
[00:00:05] this behavior of like I need a citation
[00:00:07] and then once the citation's there okay
[00:00:08] I feel good well you can find a citation
[00:00:10] for almost anything there's just a lot
[00:00:13] of bad research out there like they
[00:00:15] don't measure learning outcomes very
[00:00:16] well they don't have a well-designed
[00:00:18] study they reach conclusions like way
[00:00:20] out of whack with kind of what the the
[00:00:22] study of design is supposed to do and so
[00:00:24] there's kind of no way getting around
[00:00:27] the fact that you have to Grapple with
[00:00:29] how research is done uh or someone has
[00:00:31] to you know like someone in this
[00:00:33] research practice role if Learners dig
[00:00:35] into this enough and they want some of
[00:00:37] the primary resource like they have to
[00:00:38] start thinking about this on a certain
[00:00:40] level you need to be able to examine and
[00:00:42] synthesize from the research to really
[00:00:44] understand what it's saying one of the
[00:00:45] things that I found was that the people
[00:00:47] that are always asking for references
[00:00:48] and citations for everything are the
[00:00:50] people that even if you give it to them
[00:00:51] is going to be pointless and the people
[00:00:53] that don't ask for it they know how to
[00:00:54] look it up themselves


=== Why can some people successfully use ineffective study techniques? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csW49JYQPSY

[00:00:00] first you take notes if you're a bad
[00:00:02] note taker just use someone else's then
[00:00:04] you make a copy of those notes leaving
[00:00:06] blanks in keywords then when you study
[00:00:08] you mentally try to fill in those blanks
[00:00:10] referring to your notes when you get
[00:00:11] stuck you can literally memorize
[00:00:12] hundreds of pages of notes by using this
[00:00:14] technique once you memorize the first
[00:00:16] line without referring to your notes
[00:00:17] move on to the second line memorize your
[00:00:19] notes line by line remember you only
[00:00:21] fill in the blanks mentally and once you
[00:00:23] memorize the entire page move on to the
[00:00:25] next one then keep practicing until you
[00:00:26] memorize your entire set of notes I know
[00:00:28] there may be software out there or you
[00:00:30] might want to write this on a computer
[00:00:30] but I really think it helps to write my
[00:00:32] hand he likely has a higher level of
[00:00:36] deep processing ability and does not
[00:00:38] inherently struggle with making higher
[00:00:40] order connections without having a
[00:00:42] higher order technique this is an
[00:00:43] example of deep process tanking which is
[00:00:45] what I call it where you have people
[00:00:46] that have higher innate abilities for
[00:00:48] deep processing and they're able to get
[00:00:50] away with having ineffective techniques
[00:00:51] but you know what this is all I'm gonna
[00:00:53] say about this use this technique and
[00:00:56] then see how it works for you and then
[00:00:58] leave a comment


=== How to Change Your Behavior ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHpUULzC6iE

[00:00:00] Focus directly on the behavior we don't
[00:00:02] often go down the chain we sort of say
[00:00:04] it felt this way so I did this but
[00:00:06] actually what's more important is a
[00:00:07] chain in between because if you know
[00:00:09] that there's a behavior that occurred as
[00:00:10] a response it's very difficult to change
[00:00:12] their behavior just by willing it to
[00:00:14] change what's more you know manageable
[00:00:15] and tangible is to think about what is
[00:00:18] the chain that led to that behavior and
[00:00:19] interrupt that chain because again the
[00:00:21] behavior is kind of just the outcome
[00:00:23] it's the symptom of that underlying
[00:00:25] chain and that underlying process and
[00:00:26] that's much more disruptible and that's
[00:00:27] another thing that research is finding
[00:00:29] more and more consistently is that
[00:00:30] trying to change behaviors by trying to
[00:00:32] change the behavior is very fruitless


=== The BETTER way to do the whiteboard dump study technique ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-Z6Of1o6_E

[00:00:00] travel whiteboard and a marker test your
[00:00:03] brain by writing down everything you
[00:00:05] remember
[00:00:07] use symbols and abbreviations to make
[00:00:11] the process quicker
[00:00:13] so I think the reason they're using the
[00:00:15] Whiteboard is so that you can erase
[00:00:16] things and then do it again so you can
[00:00:18] do it like Point by point but that's
[00:00:20] actually detrimental you don't want to
[00:00:22] do it Point by point you want to be able
[00:00:24] to get everything down that you remember
[00:00:25] and then integrate and then connect it
[00:00:27] with as many things as you can so I
[00:00:30] would like
[00:00:32] look not everyone's got a tablet I
[00:00:34] understand that but if you've got a
[00:00:35] tablet and you can ride with Infinite
[00:00:36] Canvas that will be a lot better for
[00:00:38] doing this rather than a whiteboard
[00:00:40] marker or just get a big piece of paper
[00:00:42] like a a two piece of paper just get a
[00:00:45] pencil wearing a pen and just start like
[00:00:47] writing and drawing and mapping the
[00:00:49] connections on it it's going to be way
[00:00:51] harder but it's going to be more

=== What is Chain Analysis? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJRrLU3wL-4

[00:00:00] most common example is like if I'm
[00:00:01] teaching someone a new technique and the
[00:00:03] technique is a little unfamiliar to them
[00:00:04] and they're trying to use it and if
[00:00:05] they're encountering difficulty some
[00:00:07] students will encounter that difficulty
[00:00:08] and they will persist and persevere
[00:00:10] through some students will find that
[00:00:12] they feel uncomfortable and that makes
[00:00:14] them feel uncertain maybe potentially
[00:00:17] insecure and that makes them feel afraid
[00:00:19] and therefore the response to that is to
[00:00:22] not use the technique or to go back to
[00:00:24] what feels more comfortable for them and
[00:00:25] come back into their comfort zone so
[00:00:27] that would be sort of you know what we
[00:00:28] normally call a chain analysis where
[00:00:30] we're tracking what are the thoughts and
[00:00:32] feelings that have arise and then what
[00:00:34] are the subsequent thoughts and feelings
[00:00:36] that happen after that in a chain to
[00:00:38] eventually produce the behavior that's
[00:00:40] the chain that we're analyzing and this
[00:00:42] is what we in Clinical Psychology is
[00:00:43] called chain analysis


=== DON'T follow study tips like this ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvOaWo3VvXM

[00:00:00] straight a student's memorize textbook
[00:00:02] and notes you can use the one two three
[00:00:05] method first read silently in your head
[00:00:08] and write down everything you remember
[00:00:10] on a blank piece of paper repeat step
[00:00:13] one and two three times follow for more
[00:00:16] study tips
[00:00:23] every part of this is terrible this is
[00:00:26] like there's just really nothing going
[00:00:28] for this really it's a just a terrible
[00:00:31] method like look there's a generative
[00:00:33] effect from free recall that is entirely
[00:00:36] deep processing dependent but I think
[00:00:38] anyone that has even a basic
[00:00:41] understanding of learning science and
[00:00:44] how learning actually works at least
[00:00:47] like I missed the last thing she read
[00:00:49] was from 1955 like it basically ignores
[00:00:53] the last like four decades worth of
[00:00:55] Neuroscience and learning science
[00:00:57] research


=== The TRUTH about Top Achievers ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2YeEVbfALE

[00:00:00] a lot of people often don't actually
[00:00:02] know why and how they were able to
[00:00:04] succeed a lot of top achieving Learners
[00:00:06] they're not really aware of what it was
[00:00:08] that helped them do well academically or
[00:00:11] in learning they're not able to
[00:00:12] distinguish between what methods were
[00:00:15] useful versus what methods they used but
[00:00:18] actually it wasn't that the method
[00:00:20] really helped but it's that they were
[00:00:21] able to just make it work for them
[00:00:23] because they were smart enough so just
[00:00:25] observing what people that are
[00:00:27] successful are doing that is unique to
[00:00:29] them can actually be more helpful than
[00:00:32] just taking what they say at face value


=== How To Change Your Life In 2025 (with Reverse Goal Setting) ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1x659j8mA

[00:00:00] in 334 days I went from being lost and
[00:00:05] confused about what type of future I
[00:00:07] wanted for myself and generally not very
[00:00:09] happy to being fulfilled and excited
[00:00:13] about life and I did this not by just
[00:00:15] changing how I felt about things I used
[00:00:18] a method of goal setting and planning
[00:00:20] that allowed me to literally change the
[00:00:23] way that I spend each and every day
[00:00:25] giving me the confidence to know that
[00:00:27] every step that I'm taking is helping me
[00:00:28] to craft the future that I want it's a
[00:00:30] method of goal setting and planning that
[00:00:32] I now teach and train to thousands of
[00:00:35] students and professionals around the
[00:00:36] world and I firmly believe that it is
[00:00:39] one of the best ways of goal setting and
[00:00:42] planning that allows you to make a real
[00:00:44] difference in your lives rather than
[00:00:46] just feeling good because you have set
[00:00:49] goals so in this video I'm going to
[00:00:50] break down those three methods step by
[00:00:52] step and then at the end of the video
[00:00:54] I'll give you three extra steps that you
[00:00:56] can use to massively improve your
[00:00:58] chances of reaching your goals if you
[00:00:59] need to the channel welcome I'm Dr
[00:01:01] Justin sung I'm a full-time learning
[00:01:04] coach learning researcher a lecturer and
[00:01:05] the head of learning at I can study I'm
[00:01:07] also a former medical doctor and for the
[00:01:08] last decade I have worked with tens of
[00:01:11] thousands of Learners from around the
[00:01:13] world helping them to learn more
[00:01:14] efficiently in 2017 I started working as
[00:01:17] a junior doctor actually that's my
[00:01:19] stethoscope right here if you can see
[00:01:21] that that's my adrenal doctor
[00:01:22] stethoscope and I was at the time
[00:01:24] working 60 to 70 hour shifts and it was
[00:01:27] grueling these 10 hour shifts at a
[00:01:29] hospital are so much more tiring than
[00:01:31] any other 10 hours of work that I've
[00:01:33] done in any other job it is so fast
[00:01:36] paced and you're just under the pump all
[00:01:38] the time but at that point in my life I
[00:01:39] had already been running my non-profit
[00:01:42] education business here in New Zealand
[00:01:44] for four years so after work I then
[00:01:46] spend an additional three to five hours
[00:01:48] every evening just working on my
[00:01:49] business and helping my students and to
[00:01:51] be honest I actually liked it in this
[00:01:55] weird like masochistic kind of way I
[00:01:58] liked being pushed to my limit I I
[00:02:00] learned a lot about myself I really feel
[00:02:02] like I thrived in that kind of
[00:02:03] environment but fast forward six months
[00:02:06] and I was not at all having fun in that
[00:02:09] job I started really hating work yes the
[00:02:12] hours were long but the thing that
[00:02:13] really started getting to me was that I
[00:02:15] just did not feel like I had control
[00:02:16] over my life if you are working as a
[00:02:19] doctor or a nurse you're in the hospital
[00:02:21] you probably know what I mean by this
[00:02:23] your life is really dictated by like the
[00:02:26] hospital administrators and this roster
[00:02:28] and the schedule and you just don't feel
[00:02:29] like you really have any control over
[00:02:31] where your life is going anymore I was
[00:02:32] working so hard and it felt like the
[00:02:36] impact that I could make was just being
[00:02:38] absolutely crushed by this hugely
[00:02:41] inefficient system and I knew that my
[00:02:42] work was important like technically but
[00:02:45] I stopped feeling that it was important
[00:02:47] and I think that's really important that
[00:02:48] you feel connected with the work that
[00:02:50] you're doing I really stopped feeling
[00:02:52] that while I was working as a doctor so
[00:02:54] I know that it's a little bit ironic in
[00:02:55] a way to say that my work as a doctor
[00:02:57] didn't seem fulfilling even though the
[00:02:59] work of a doctor doctor is so impactful
[00:03:01] but like working in that system just
[00:03:03] took all of that human element out of it
[00:03:06] for me at least personally and then it
[00:03:08] was kind of this like double frustration
[00:03:11] for me because I was also business
[00:03:12] minded so I could see how the system
[00:03:14] could be improved but then at the same
[00:03:16] time I felt like even more frustrated
[00:03:18] because I couldn't actually do anything
[00:03:19] to change that so that really really
[00:03:21] bugged me and I became very
[00:03:22] disillusioned with the idea of clinical
[00:03:23] practice and I felt like my soul and
[00:03:26] energy was just being completely drained
[00:03:28] like I remember that there would be
[00:03:29] these times where I would wake up in the
[00:03:31] morning and I would legitimately feel
[00:03:33] like I wanted to be sick like I I wished
[00:03:36] I was sick just so that I would have a
[00:03:39] real reason not to go into work that day
[00:03:42] or like I would hope that there would be
[00:03:43] this natural disaster that occurs it
[00:03:45] cuts off all the roads and access to the
[00:03:47] hospital so it's like oh I really want
[00:03:49] to come into work but there's no
[00:03:50] possible way that I can get there I
[00:03:52] guess I'll just have to stay home today
[00:03:53] like I would legitimately feel these
[00:03:55] things I would dread waking up going
[00:03:57] into work and that's a terrible way to
[00:03:59] feel and I know that that's the way that
[00:04:01] a lot of people actually feel about
[00:04:02] their jobs and so after months of
[00:04:05] feeling this way I eventually decided to
[00:04:08] leave full-time medicine and swap into
[00:04:11] education full-time and that's been like
[00:04:13] four years ago so on the 26th of May
[00:04:16] 2019 I worked my final day as a clinical
[00:04:20] doctor actually technically not true
[00:04:21] because like a year later I picked up a
[00:04:23] Locum shift and I absolutely hated it
[00:04:26] and then I just never picked up another
[00:04:27] shift again but officially 26th of May
[00:04:29] 2019 that was my final day as a doctor
[00:04:31] and when I talk about now I can talk
[00:04:32] about it really objectively but at the
[00:04:34] time I was really uncertain like can I
[00:04:36] make it on my own can I be successful
[00:04:38] doing this what type of Life am I even
[00:04:40] gonna craft for myself what is it going
[00:04:42] to look like what do I need to do to
[00:04:43] make it work and this is when I use
[00:04:45] reverse goal setting and by using this
[00:04:47] method I was able to create a plan and a
[00:04:50] structure of exactly how I would spend
[00:04:52] every single day and every single week
[00:04:53] to get to the goal that I wanted to get
[00:04:55] to and then on the 24th of April 2020
[00:04:59] exactly 3 134 days after my last day I
[00:05:01] was able to create this map and this is
[00:05:04] a map that eventually became the basis
[00:05:06] for the I can study learning program
[00:05:07] which is now used by thousands of people
[00:05:09] around the world it's also at the same
[00:05:11] time when I was working out of this
[00:05:13] office which you may recognize as a
[00:05:15] backdrop for my older videos since then
[00:05:19] I have felt so much more control of my
[00:05:22] life I wake up feeling energized I look
[00:05:24] forward to working I feel like the way
[00:05:26] that I'm spending my time is helping me
[00:05:27] to build the future that I want I'm
[00:05:29] excited about it I feel fulfilled more
[00:05:32] fulfilled than when I was working as a
[00:05:33] doctor especially you know some of the
[00:05:34] messages and reviews that people and
[00:05:37] emails that people are sending me about
[00:05:38] the impact that it's had on their lives
[00:05:40] reading these kinds of messages it makes
[00:05:42] me feel like my impact is being
[00:05:44] Amplified rather than being just like
[00:05:46] smushed into nothing so although my
[00:05:48] story is about leaving medicine I think
[00:05:50] that the uncertainties are really the
[00:05:52] same for anyone who's kind of unhappy
[00:05:54] about their current situation and
[00:05:56] wanting to know how to make a change the
[00:05:58] questions like will things get better
[00:06:00] can I even make it what if I fail what
[00:06:03] am I even meant to do ultimately I think
[00:06:05] the question is I feel bad about my
[00:06:07] current situation what do I do about it
[00:06:10] and this is where reverse go setting
[00:06:11] would come in handy so here's how the
[00:06:13] framework goes the idea with normal goal
[00:06:15] setting is we say where are we now where
[00:06:19] do we want to get to and then how do we
[00:06:21] go from where we are now to where we
[00:06:23] want to get to it's very logical and
[00:06:25] there's nothing inherently wrong with
[00:06:27] this but it can be complicated when your
[00:06:30] goal is very long term or very complex
[00:06:32] and it's actually unclear how you can
[00:06:35] actually get to where you want to go
[00:06:37] from where you are and these are the
[00:06:39] types of situations where reverse goal
[00:06:40] setting really shines now I've I call it
[00:06:43] reverse goal setting I think it's also
[00:06:44] called backwards goal setting I'm sure
[00:06:46] lots of other people talk about this
[00:06:47] topic I've been using this for such a
[00:06:49] long time I actually don't remember if I
[00:06:50] thought of this myself or if I read it
[00:06:51] from somewhere so I'm sure this is not
[00:06:53] going to be like a super original
[00:06:54] concept but I think it's very helpful
[00:06:56] regardless so let's go through the Steps
[00:06:58] step one is to ask ourselves where do we
[00:07:02] want to get to what is the goal and this
[00:07:05] can be a long-term goal it can be a
[00:07:07] medium-term goal I'd recommend choosing
[00:07:09] something that's at least sort of six to
[00:07:12] nine months away otherwise it's not
[00:07:14] going to be as useful and there's some
[00:07:16] issues with this that we're going to
[00:07:17] cover at the end of this video if we
[00:07:18] choose a time period that is too short
[00:07:20] so this here is our goal and for me that
[00:07:24] was for me to have my own business I
[00:07:26] wanted to be in control of my hours and
[00:07:28] my time and my energy and what I was
[00:07:30] doing with my days I wanted to produce
[00:07:33] an impact and help people in the realm
[00:07:36] of Education where I used my expertise
[00:07:38] and I wanted to do this at a massive
[00:07:40] scale those were really important for me
[00:07:42] so that was my goal and then what you do
[00:07:44] is that you imagine the person who could
[00:07:48] definitely already achieve this goal
[00:07:50] this is like this hypothetical person
[00:07:52] who is the perfect person that would a
[00:07:56] hundred percent achieve this goal if no
[00:07:58] one else in the world could achieve this
[00:07:59] goal except for this person this is the
[00:08:02] guy that's gonna do it or the girl and
[00:08:04] you ask yourself for this perfect
[00:08:05] hypothetical person what are the skills
[00:08:08] and the attributes and the assets and
[00:08:10] the knowledge that this person has that
[00:08:13] makes this goal inevitable for them and
[00:08:16] so by the end of this stage we've
[00:08:18] created like this artificial person that
[00:08:21] would be perfectly primed to have
[00:08:23] achieved the scope here are a list of
[00:08:25] some of the categories that I use for
[00:08:27] thinking about all the different
[00:08:28] attributes feel free to pause on the
[00:08:30] screen and take a screenshot if you need
[00:08:31] to each of these items is related to
[00:08:35] Something in the research that's called
[00:08:36] employability capitals which is a little
[00:08:38] bit more recent in the research but it's
[00:08:39] about looking at the factors that
[00:08:41] contribute to and influence a person's
[00:08:43] ability to succeed especially in their
[00:08:45] career and what we're going to do is
[00:08:47] we're going to work back from these so
[00:08:48] for each of these items we actually want
[00:08:50] to rate and score this hypothetical
[00:08:53] person we've imagined out of 10. so you
[00:08:56] don't have to do 10 out of 10 for
[00:08:57] everything of course that's going to be
[00:08:58] the best but it's not always going to be
[00:08:59] necessary to achieve this goal like you
[00:09:01] don't have to have the literal perfect
[00:09:04] specimen of a human to achieve a goal
[00:09:07] that is not you know like to become you
[00:09:09] know like a crazy astronaut person
[00:09:11] although if your goal that you're using
[00:09:13] here is to become an astronaut maybe you
[00:09:14] do need to have 10 out of 10 for
[00:09:15] everything so by the end of this you're
[00:09:16] going to have a list of all of these
[00:09:18] ratings 7 out of 10 for some of them six
[00:09:20] out of 10 for some 10 out of 10 for some
[00:09:21] of them and you'll have this character
[00:09:22] profile file of this ideal person that
[00:09:25] you want to craft yourself into becoming
[00:09:27] so that you can reach this goal for each
[00:09:29] of these items as well as scoring them
[00:09:30] also leave a little comment about what
[00:09:32] that really looks like so that's
[00:09:34] specific you want to be able to look at
[00:09:35] this list in the future and be really
[00:09:37] really clear about what particular
[00:09:38] aspects this person is good at and what
[00:09:40] they're bad at so when you know the item
[00:09:42] says time management gives the rating
[00:09:44] for time management but make a few
[00:09:46] comments and remarks in terms of what
[00:09:48] time management means for you or means
[00:09:50] for this person and why they're so good
[00:09:52] at it now in addition to this list of
[00:09:55] items another thing that we know really
[00:09:57] helps you to succeed and thrive in
[00:09:59] whatever goal that you have planned is
[00:10:01] to like this video And subscribe so
[00:10:03] anyway for me when I did this I found
[00:10:05] that I had some high priority gaps and
[00:10:08] especially my business knowledge and
[00:10:10] Acumen and my networks and some of my
[00:10:12] qualifications so that formed part of
[00:10:14] the plan for my next steps so step three
[00:10:17] after we've done this is we're going to
[00:10:19] look at our current state and use the
[00:10:22] exact same items and do the same process
[00:10:24] so how do we score ourselves on each of
[00:10:27] these items and leave a few comments
[00:10:29] rationalizing and explaining why once
[00:10:31] we've done this we're ready for step
[00:10:32] four which is to do a force field
[00:10:35] analysis which is a type of analysis
[00:10:37] that we can do that helps us to identify
[00:10:40] the barriers and drivers to helping us
[00:10:42] achieve our goals so on one side of this
[00:10:45] force field you're going to draw the
[00:10:47] barriers so these are the things that
[00:10:49] would prevent you from developing your
[00:10:51] skills and your attributes and your
[00:10:52] knowledge and whatever you need to do to
[00:10:55] grow into becoming this person what are
[00:10:58] the things that stop you and prevent you
[00:11:00] on the other side we put down our
[00:11:02] resources when we think of resources we
[00:11:05] can think of the physical resources
[00:11:07] tangible things such as access to books
[00:11:10] and and technology and the courses and
[00:11:13] you know like literal physical things
[00:11:15] that you can use and activate to help
[00:11:17] you achieve these things as well as the
[00:11:19] time we have available to invest the
[00:11:21] money we have available to invest and
[00:11:23] the people we have access to so you can
[00:11:24] think about resources in these four
[00:11:26] categories and then finally we're ready
[00:11:27] for step five which is to then create
[00:11:30] the plan and this is focused on the
[00:11:32] immediate Next Step the idea is how do
[00:11:34] we use the resources at our disposal to
[00:11:37] overcome the barriers we have identified
[00:11:40] and help us incrementally slightly
[00:11:43] improve and develop closer to becoming
[00:11:46] that ideal person that we have already
[00:11:48] envisaged envisaged in envisaged
[00:11:51] envisioned
[00:11:53] um
[00:11:55] thought off at this point when you're
[00:11:57] making these really really short-term
[00:11:58] goals like what can I do in the next day
[00:12:00] or the next week that's going to get me
[00:12:02] that one step closer you can use you
[00:12:04] know smart goals or any other type of
[00:12:06] goal setting framework here's an example
[00:12:08] of smart goals that I just picked up off
[00:12:09] indeed.com I'm not going to go over
[00:12:11] smart goal setting here there is 100
[00:12:13] million other videos that can explain
[00:12:15] this it's a very well established
[00:12:16] framework of goal setting you've
[00:12:18] probably already heard of it yourself
[00:12:18] using this type of goal setting can help
[00:12:20] make your goals more actionable more
[00:12:23] measurable more concrete and therefore
[00:12:25] overall more likely for you to actually
[00:12:27] reach it and achieve it so this is the
[00:12:29] situation where you might use one of
[00:12:31] those types of techniques and so this is
[00:12:32] really the summary of reverse goal
[00:12:34] setting and you can see why it's
[00:12:35] reversed because we're starting with the
[00:12:36] goal where we want to end up and then
[00:12:38] we're thinking about what type of person
[00:12:40] would be able to achieve that with
[00:12:42] carrying that back in terms of what are
[00:12:44] the attributes and the skills and the
[00:12:45] knowledge and the assets that this
[00:12:46] person has that allows them to so easily
[00:12:48] achieve this goal and we're saying well
[00:12:50] how can I become that person so that
[00:12:52] achieving the goal becomes an
[00:12:53] inevitability for us and then we can
[00:12:57] take the immediate Next Step which is to
[00:12:59] bring ourselves a little bit marginally
[00:13:02] closer by using reverse goal setting
[00:13:04] settings as a very process oriented very
[00:13:08] actionable way that gives us the highest
[00:13:11] chance of success for achieving our
[00:13:13] goals but wait there's more there are
[00:13:16] actually three more things that you can
[00:13:19] be spending extra time doing we're
[00:13:22] spending a little bit more time on these
[00:13:24] three things will massively increase
[00:13:27] your chances of being able to achieve
[00:13:29] your goals the first one is in spending
[00:13:31] more time to learn about the actual goal
[00:13:35] itself
[00:13:36] obviously in order to know what type of
[00:13:39] person you need to be to achieve these
[00:13:41] goals you actually need to know about
[00:13:43] the nature of the goal so if you are
[00:13:45] unable to accurately identify the
[00:13:47] attributes and how good you need to have
[00:13:49] those attributes then it affects
[00:13:51] everything else with regards to your
[00:13:52] plan and that can mean that you spend a
[00:13:55] lot more time and energy either
[00:13:57] developing skills that are actually
[00:13:59] unnecessary or maybe neglecting skills
[00:14:01] you didn't realize were really important
[00:14:03] to develop so spend some extra time to
[00:14:05] talk to people gain more information
[00:14:07] about this do some reading and here's a
[00:14:09] pro tip for you observation is often
[00:14:11] better than Insight a lot of people
[00:14:13] often don't actually know why and how
[00:14:16] they were able to succeed and I see this
[00:14:18] a lot especially in learning a lot of
[00:14:20] top achieving Learners they're not
[00:14:22] really aware of what it was that helped
[00:14:24] them do well academically or in learning
[00:14:27] they're not able to distinguish between
[00:14:28] what methods were useful versus what
[00:14:31] methods they used but actually it wasn't
[00:14:34] that the method really helped but that
[00:14:36] they were able to just make it work for
[00:14:38] them because it was smart enough or
[00:14:40] there were some other factors at play so
[00:14:42] just observing what people that are
[00:14:44] successful are doing that is unique to
[00:14:46] them can actually be more helpful than
[00:14:49] just taking what they say at face value
[00:14:51] sometimes
[00:14:53] likewise for number two I would really
[00:14:55] recommend that you spend more time to
[00:14:57] learn more about yourself again if
[00:15:01] you're not able to correctly rate
[00:15:02] yourself then your plan is going to be
[00:15:04] wonky in all sorts of ways it's
[00:15:05] worthwhile to spend the months or even
[00:15:08] longer actually observing and reflecting
[00:15:10] on the methods and the skills and the
[00:15:12] techniques and knowledge and assets that
[00:15:13] you use or have access to so you can
[00:15:16] give yourself a proper rating when you
[00:15:17] do this process you may actually realize
[00:15:19] and and learn more about your methods
[00:15:22] and techniques than you realize and that
[00:15:24] in itself is actually going to be hugely
[00:15:26] beneficial for you and because both
[00:15:27] number one learning about the goal and
[00:15:29] number two learning about yourself
[00:15:30] affect every other part of the plan
[00:15:33] moving forward spending that extra month
[00:15:36] for example upfront pays off big time
[00:15:39] and preventing wasted time and effort
[00:15:41] especially if you've got a goal that is
[00:15:43] going to take like one or two or three
[00:15:45] or four or five years and finally number
[00:15:46] three is to spend more time to like
[00:15:49] these videos I mean uh spend more time
[00:15:52] to play want a realistic timeline one
[00:15:55] thing that I would strongly recommend
[00:15:56] that you do is to look at each of your
[00:15:58] items and think how long would it take
[00:16:00] to improve each item by just one so if
[00:16:04] you're a three out of ten right now but
[00:16:06] you want to get to a seven out of ten
[00:16:07] then how long will it take to get from
[00:16:09] three to four then four to five and five
[00:16:11] to six on and so forth until you hit
[00:16:13] seven or whatever your goal is you then
[00:16:14] want to think about how many items you
[00:16:17] can realistically improve simultaneously
[00:16:20] because you can't cover everything all
[00:16:22] at once in my experience having done
[00:16:23] this activity and taught this technique
[00:16:25] to so many people now I can say as a
[00:16:27] general rule of thumb that it's not easy
[00:16:30] to improve on more than two or three
[00:16:32] items at a time otherwise you end up
[00:16:35] getting overloaded and you risk not
[00:16:36] making good progress on anything and
[00:16:38] there's another rule of thumb I've
[00:16:40] generally observed that you can improve
[00:16:42] each of these items by one out of ten
[00:16:44] each month if you're diligent but then
[00:16:48] it starts to slow down so it might take
[00:16:50] you months to go from seven to an eight
[00:16:52] and then seven more months to go from an
[00:16:54] eight to a nine years to go from nine to
[00:16:55] a ten and this is just the nature of
[00:16:57] becoming an expert getting to 10 out of
[00:16:59] 10 for anything takes years not months
[00:17:02] now when you do these three activities
[00:17:04] especially the last one you will find
[00:17:07] probably that in a lot of cases you may
[00:17:09] not actually know how to improve in the
[00:17:12] first place like you're three out of ten
[00:17:14] now you need to get to seven out of ten
[00:17:15] but you don't actually know how to go
[00:17:17] from three to four in the first place if
[00:17:19] that's the situation then the most
[00:17:21] important thing for you moving forward
[00:17:22] is your next step needs to be to learn
[00:17:24] how to improve otherwise you really
[00:17:27] can't plan for anything you're not going
[00:17:29] to be able to make an estimate of how
[00:17:30] long it's going to take you you'll only
[00:17:32] be left with an intention and this is a
[00:17:33] trap and a lot of people fall into when
[00:17:35] they're goal setting is that they think
[00:17:36] well I intend to get better but they
[00:17:38] don't really have a mechanism for how
[00:17:40] that Improvement is going to take place
[00:17:42] time passing does nothing is what we do
[00:17:45] in that time that matters and speaking
[00:17:47] of time you may also find that when you
[00:17:50] do this activity the time that it takes
[00:17:52] for you to get to your desired attribute
[00:17:55] profile is longer than the time that you
[00:17:58] have available to reach that goal if
[00:18:00] this is a situation you may need to
[00:18:02] reconsider your goal and I know that
[00:18:05] that can be really really challenging
[00:18:06] but it's just the truth sometimes if you
[00:18:09] leave things too late there's only so
[00:18:11] much that you can do I'm not saying give
[00:18:13] up on the go but at least you'll have to
[00:18:15] acknowledge that there's going to be an
[00:18:17] element of luck in trying to reach that
[00:18:19] so in my example because I'd already
[00:18:22] been doing the coaching and the learning
[00:18:24] Consulting thing for years six or seven
[00:18:26] years by the time I was doing this plan
[00:18:27] for myself the specific knowledge around
[00:18:29] learning science and the coaching
[00:18:31] practice there wasn't a big gap there a
[00:18:33] few things that I wanted to refine and
[00:18:35] so it was realistic for me to try to
[00:18:36] refine that within a year if that wasn't
[00:18:39] the case and I'd only been doing this
[00:18:41] for like one or two years then creating
[00:18:43] a life transformative program for people
[00:18:46] to use all around the world within one
[00:18:48] year that wouldn't have been realistic
[00:18:49] so I would have had to reconsider my
[00:18:51] goal in the first place now a common
[00:18:53] example of where I see this is with
[00:18:56] people setting really short-term goals
[00:18:57] for these exams and this is the reason
[00:18:59] at the very beginning why I said use a
[00:19:02] longer term goal a lot of people will
[00:19:04] use an exam in like three or four months
[00:19:07] and they're really deficient on a lot of
[00:19:09] these attributes so it's not very
[00:19:12] practical or realistic for all of those
[00:19:14] things to improve the amount that they
[00:19:17] need to in just three or four months in
[00:19:19] that situation it may actually be wiser
[00:19:22] to forego that exam and just accept that
[00:19:25] you're not going to do very well in that
[00:19:26] exam but then work on creating a plan to
[00:19:28] develop each of these skills so that
[00:19:30] next year if you can reset that exam you
[00:19:33] absolutely crush it but then now you're
[00:19:35] actually prepared for every exam and
[00:19:37] every year that comes up after that
[00:19:39] because your skills are fundamentally
[00:19:41] higher whereas if you were to create a
[00:19:44] plan that only optimizes for that
[00:19:46] short-term goal then your plan may just
[00:19:48] be like study study study study every
[00:19:50] single day and then if you aren't able
[00:19:52] to do well because you didn't have the
[00:19:54] skills and the attributes now you've
[00:19:56] actually failed at reaching your goal in
[00:19:58] the first place and also you didn't
[00:19:59] develop any other skills needed to
[00:20:01] tackle it moving forward so you kind of
[00:20:03] like screwed yourself twice there and
[00:20:05] again it's really really really hard to
[00:20:08] reconsider a goal I fully get that and
[00:20:11] that's like a personal decision I'm
[00:20:13] going to leave that up to you but just
[00:20:14] some thoughts to think about now to make
[00:20:15] this all a little bit easier for you let
[00:20:17] me help you with some of those first few
[00:20:18] steps if you want to learn a little bit
[00:20:20] more about how you can improve your
[00:20:22] learning efficiency and how to think
[00:20:23] about that and what you can do to set up
[00:20:25] a plan then I would recommend starting
[00:20:27] with this video here around how you can
[00:20:30] train your brain to become smarter if
[00:20:33] you're wanting to learn a little bit
[00:20:34] more about time management how you can
[00:20:36] improve that then you might want to
[00:20:38] start with this episode here where I
[00:20:40] talk about why time management is a lot
[00:20:43] of cases a little bit overrated and if
[00:20:45] you want a step-by-step guide on how you
[00:20:47] can improve almost all of these items in
[00:20:49] the fastest possible way then you may be
[00:20:52] interested in checking out my program at
[00:20:53] icanstudy.com everything that I've
[00:20:55] talked about in this video and a lot
[00:20:57] more is covered in the earlier modules
[00:20:59] of that program so you can check the
[00:21:01] link in the description to watch more
[00:21:02] otherwise thanks for watching appreciate

=== The power of reverse goal setting ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woRAgn_c5Mk

[00:00:00] in 2017 I started working as a junior
[00:00:02] doctor I just did not feel like I had
[00:00:04] control over my life my soul and energy
[00:00:07] was just being completely drained what
[00:00:10] do I need to do to make it work and this
[00:00:12] is when I use reverse goal setting and
[00:00:14] by using this method I was able to
[00:00:16] create a plan and a structure of exactly
[00:00:18] how I would spend every single day and
[00:00:20] every single week to get to the goal
[00:00:22] that I wanted to get to I was able to
[00:00:23] create this map and this is a map that
[00:00:26] eventually became the basis for the I
[00:00:28] can study learning program which is now
[00:00:30] used by thousands of people around the
[00:00:31] world since then I have felt so much
[00:00:34] more control of my life


=== Why brain-dumps aren't always effective? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt9WvrInOAU

[00:00:00] rather than just passively rereading
[00:00:02] your textbook highlighting your notes
[00:00:04] which is amazing and easy and fun which
[00:00:06] is why we all do it it's completely
[00:00:08] correct something called active recall
[00:00:10] it's hard it is taking knowledge out of
[00:00:13] your brain instead of just rereading
[00:00:15] stuff I'm gonna choose something to
[00:00:17] remember let's do chapter one biology
[00:00:19] I'm going to test myself on it and I'm
[00:00:21] gonna write down every single thing that
[00:00:23] I can remember from that chapter from
[00:00:24] memory and I can use a few prompt words
[00:00:26] if I want from the chapter but I'm just
[00:00:29] going to go ahead and write
[00:00:31] [Music]
[00:00:34] okay so here's actually an interesting
[00:00:37] thing that I want to point out I want
[00:00:38] you to look at the notes that they've
[00:00:39] written they're actually writing mixed
[00:00:41] notes mixed notes is when you have
[00:00:42] linear as well as some non-linear
[00:00:45] relational note taking this is a
[00:00:46] technique that's going to be really good
[00:00:48] if you already have high deep processing
[00:00:50] but if you're struggling with the Deep
[00:00:51] processing in itself that is something
[00:00:54] that this technique is not going to help
[00:00:55] with


=== Studying is not learning ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcXuActro70

[00:00:00] so here's what I know now that just
[00:00:01] changed the game studying is not the
[00:00:03] same thing as learning studying is like
[00:00:05] reading a book or writing some notes but
[00:00:07] you haven't learned it until that
[00:00:08] knowledge is in your head and you can
[00:00:10] use it and there's different levels too
[00:00:12] for example regurgitating some facts as
[00:00:14] a lower level than a nuanced discussion
[00:00:16] or solving complex problems researchers
[00:00:19] sometimes talk about this as higher
[00:00:21] order versus lower order learning and
[00:00:24] different types of studying can actually
[00:00:25] help to generate different orders of
[00:00:27] learning why does this matter years ago
[00:00:29] I didn't know about this stuff and I
[00:00:31] thought I was pretty good at studying
[00:00:32] after all I got into medical school all
[00:00:34] that time and effort that I sunk in just
[00:00:36] what you do right you work hard not
[00:00:38] quite imagine you're driving along and
[00:00:40] your car breaks down if you're like me
[00:00:41] pull over pop the hood take a look and
[00:00:43] you think I don't know anything about
[00:00:45] cars if you don't know how the engine
[00:00:47] works you cannot fix it most people know
[00:00:50] that learning is a process but what goes
[00:00:52] on in that process if we don't do well
[00:00:54] do we know why and how to fix it or do
[00:00:56] we just guess and hope causes a lot of
[00:00:58] anxiety


=== Research publication bias is a BIG problem ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ5X3G7HCP0

[00:00:00] There is almost like a bandwagon fallacy
[00:00:02] effect that occurs with this publication
[00:00:04] bias where you have all these
[00:00:06] Publications around a certain concept
[00:00:07] that sort of self-validating each other
[00:00:09] without taking a more critical lens at
[00:00:11] like how relevant is that or is that
[00:00:12] really the direction we should be going
[00:00:13] in the great example I have around this
[00:00:15] is learning styles where learning styles
[00:00:17] just became this enormous movement and
[00:00:19] fed it became like essentially
[00:00:20] ubiquitous Universal everywhere like a
[00:00:22] lot of times if you begin a research
[00:00:24] study with a faulty presumption then the
[00:00:27] whole study itself doesn't really count
[00:00:30] for much


=== Don't rely on positive reinforcement for motivation ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yot7HltnLks

[00:00:00] here's how to study when you really
[00:00:02] don't feel like studying guys this hat
[00:00:04] helped me from getting nothing done to
[00:00:06] getting everything done first step is to
[00:00:08] go to the store and buy some trees now
[00:00:10] every time you study for over 30 minutes
[00:00:13] reward yourself with a treat this is
[00:00:15] green stuff Behavior psychology it
[00:00:18] literally motivates you to start
[00:00:20] studying follow for more hacks
[00:00:22] this is talking about the consequence
[00:00:24] aspect of behavior change and Behavioral
[00:00:26] Science the consequence means that a
[00:00:29] behavior is being reinforced if I do
[00:00:31] something and I positively reinforce
[00:00:32] myself then it creates like that little
[00:00:34] you know bit of a dopamine head I feel
[00:00:36] bitter about it and it creates a level
[00:00:37] of conditioning modern research is
[00:00:39] moving away from consequences and
[00:00:41] reinforcement because consequences are
[00:00:44] much less of a driver of behavior change
[00:00:47] than the opposite which is the thing
[00:00:49] that comes before the behavior which is
[00:00:51] often called antecedence antecedents are
[00:00:53] the triggers that create a behavior in
[00:00:55] the first place


=== The BIGGEST problem with flashcards ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTFtOA3dh0c

[00:00:00] I have used flash cards like if I was
[00:00:01] going to learn a language I might use
[00:00:03] some flash cards in the beginning but
[00:00:04] I've had this experience where if you're
[00:00:06] on the flashcard app and you put it in
[00:00:08] and you miss it that first round and
[00:00:10] then it's like it'll prompt you again in
[00:00:11] I don't know 10 seconds and then you're
[00:00:13] like okay probably again and it's like
[00:00:14] well the question is why did you not
[00:00:16] know that just being prompted again 30
[00:00:19] seconds later is not really going to
[00:00:22] materially change what you know if all
[00:00:25] you look at oh yeah this is supposed to
[00:00:26] be that okay that's it and one of the
[00:00:28] things with flash cuts and I think that
[00:00:29] happens a lot is people don't really see
[00:00:31] the difference between queued versus
[00:00:32] free recall what happens is they they
[00:00:34] just build pattern recognition for that
[00:00:36] very specific cue of that flashcard
[00:00:38] they'll read the first three words
[00:00:39] remember what that flashcard was and
[00:00:40] they'll be able to record the things
[00:00:41] without really having to do any of the
[00:00:43] actual type of retrieval process that
[00:00:45] you would need to do if assessed in any
[00:00:46] other context and it creates this
[00:00:48] illusion of confidence


=== How are group assignments beneficial? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBTuQi-KdM

[00:00:00] group assignments group assignments uh
[00:00:02] yeah they're overrated for sure because
[00:00:04] most people in your group are not
[00:00:05] pulling their way and and number two
[00:00:07] most people that are giving you the
[00:00:08] assignments don't really know if their
[00:00:10] time is even going to help you in the
[00:00:11] first place uh and then number three
[00:00:13] they're often very annoying logistically
[00:00:16] and just to get your head around to try
[00:00:18] to complete them
[00:00:19] there are some exceptions obviously but
[00:00:21] just as a blanket statement and I'm
[00:00:23] saying this like I've looked through
[00:00:25] lots of different curriculums and I've
[00:00:27] looked through different ways that
[00:00:28] Educators and different institutions at
[00:00:30] both secondary and tertiary education
[00:00:32] tend to
[00:00:34] think about assignments well I don't
[00:00:36] think it's very well thought out in a
[00:00:37] lot of ways so I'm gonna say in general
[00:00:39] the group assignments are kind of
[00:00:40] overrated they can be really tokenistic
[00:00:43] as well


=== What I notice in all successful students ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ4uPXLbIrE

[00:00:00] I think the sign of someone that is
[00:00:01] actually truly intelligent and also
[00:00:03] mature and therefore is able to be
[00:00:04] successful is the ability to actually
[00:00:06] entertain the idea that maybe they're
[00:00:09] not as good that they don't know as much
[00:00:10] it's much better to go in under that
[00:00:13] assumption and then realize hey I was
[00:00:15] actually that good rather than go in
[00:00:16] under the assumption that you were and
[00:00:18] then miss out on the learning that you
[00:00:20] could have and I think that that comes
[00:00:21] down to kind of more of a sense of
[00:00:23] security and ego than really truly
[00:00:25] anything else


=== Is gaming overrated or underrated? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7K6e0LKtog

[00:00:00] gaming
[00:00:01] gaming
[00:00:03] I mean gaming is so hyped at the moment
[00:00:05] right like it's such a popular thing
[00:00:07] like I think gaming is properly rated
[00:00:11] it's fun I like gaming
[00:00:14] um you know if you're addicted that's
[00:00:15] not good but so is being addicted to
[00:00:17] anything I think it gets a bad rip
[00:00:21] um
[00:00:21] but I don't think that bad rep is
[00:00:23] necessarily deserved actually so I'm
[00:00:26] gonna say that it's super hype and it
[00:00:28] has a bad rip properly rated


=== Why are TikTok study tips harmful? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8fQo-3tXvk

[00:00:00] your teacher announces the highest and
[00:00:02] lowest grades on the last exam somehow
[00:00:04] you got the highest here's what you did
[00:00:06] so back in college I tried this weird
[00:00:08] technique called blurting I pulled out
[00:00:10] my notes the night before a huge biology
[00:00:13] exam and reviewed everything for 30
[00:00:15] minutes then I put my notes away took
[00:00:18] out a separate sheet of paper and wrote
[00:00:19] down everything that I could remember
[00:00:21] once done I used a different colored pen
[00:00:24] to write down everything I forgot
[00:00:25] repeated this process and used other
[00:00:27] tricks follow along
[00:00:30] the problem that I have is like it's
[00:00:32] really really simplified the message
[00:00:34] that studying and studying well is a
[00:00:37] simple thing to do is harmful when you
[00:00:39] hear a message saying like this is how
[00:00:41] you get the top Mark like this is what
[00:00:43] you did what that means is that if you
[00:00:45] do this technique and you still do not
[00:00:48] do well for the people that don't do
[00:00:50] well how they feel is even worse they
[00:00:53] will then start believing that they are
[00:00:56] the problem


=== How can you study ahead of the class? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEwzx3F7UJU

[00:00:00] studying ahead of class yeah definitely
[00:00:02] underrated but you don't have to like be
[00:00:05] studying everything ahead of class I
[00:00:07] think the issue is that most people
[00:00:08] don't know how to study ahead of class
[00:00:10] in a way that's effective for them that
[00:00:13] is good priming when people study ahead
[00:00:15] of class they still study at lower
[00:00:16] orders ahead of class and that is
[00:00:19] honestly like a little bit pointless
[00:00:21] like there is still a benefit but that
[00:00:24] amount of time could have been used for
[00:00:25] something that's so much more productive
[00:00:26] and people aren't used to working with
[00:00:29] purely higher order structures before
[00:00:30] filling in lower order detail but if you
[00:00:33] were able to do that then that method of
[00:00:35] Presidio priming is very helpful


=== Most students do not know their potential with learning. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGmKC2luMY

[00:00:00] was doing these deep consultations with
[00:00:01] students where I'd sit with them for an
[00:00:03] hour a couple hours and would go through
[00:00:04] every single thing that they're doing in
[00:00:06] terms of their learning process and then
[00:00:07] all the struggles that they're facing
[00:00:08] and then I would look through it and I'd
[00:00:09] say okay well here's the issue this is
[00:00:11] the reason why your entire life you've
[00:00:12] had these negative experiences like your
[00:00:14] base intelligence is actually good
[00:00:15] enough it's just being throttled because
[00:00:16] your Technique is garbage and at the
[00:00:18] time I sort of I saw it from a very
[00:00:20] mechanical tactical point of view like
[00:00:22] here are the techniques that are not
[00:00:23] working you just replace them and you're
[00:00:24] going to get better results good you've
[00:00:25] hit your outcome but they started crying
[00:00:27] and they started breaking down and
[00:00:28] initially I was very confused I was like
[00:00:29] oh did I say something wrong you
[00:00:31] know
[00:00:32] empathetic enough or whatever you know
[00:00:34] what was going on


=== Are brain dumps useful? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNDLSN8ULJo

[00:00:00] brain dots brain dumps are underrated
[00:00:03] because most people don't know them I'm
[00:00:05] pretty sure it's not a commonly known
[00:00:06] technique still fairly underutilized
[00:00:09] brain dumps are are good they're
[00:00:11] effective you need to be able to do
[00:00:12] different orders of learning for brain
[00:00:14] dumps don't just do the lower order ones
[00:00:15] low water brain dams are good for low or
[00:00:17] order retrieval practice but you you
[00:00:20] need to make sure that it's not the only
[00:00:21] method of retrieval practice like make
[00:00:22] sure to hit the higher rotors because
[00:00:23] you're going to get tested at the higher
[00:00:24] orders anyway


=== Learning Expert plays Overrated Underrated with Study Techniques ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9wsjsm0KBc

[00:00:00] hey everyone it's Dr Justin sung here
[00:00:01] I'm a former medical doctor and now
[00:00:03] full-time running coaching consultant
[00:00:04] and welcome to another episode of
[00:00:06] overrated underrated where we're going
[00:00:08] to be going through lots of different
[00:00:09] ideas and I'm going to be explaining my
[00:00:11] take on them as briefly as possible
[00:00:13] [Music]
[00:00:18] brain dumps are underrated because most
[00:00:21] people don't know them I'm pretty sure
[00:00:24] it's not a commonly known technique it's
[00:00:26] one of the more common ones I think but
[00:00:27] it's still fairly underutilized yeah
[00:00:30] brain dumps are good they're effective
[00:00:32] you need to be able to do different
[00:00:33] orders of learning for brain dumps don't
[00:00:35] just do the lower order ones like low
[00:00:37] order brain dams are good for lower
[00:00:38] order retrieval practice but you you
[00:00:41] need to make sure that it's not the only
[00:00:42] method of retrieval practice like make
[00:00:43] sure to hit the higher rotors because
[00:00:44] you're going to get tested at the higher
[00:00:46] orders anyway self-care self-care is so
[00:00:49] misunderstood and for that reason I'd
[00:00:52] say it's very underrated and and I say
[00:00:54] this as someone who like probably
[00:00:56] doesn't do enough self-care myself and
[00:00:59] I'm also internally saying I'm
[00:01:01] underrating it myself but you know you
[00:01:05] can't pull out an empty Cup right but
[00:01:07] most people is not like empty cup it's
[00:01:09] like the cup is broken and the hand is
[00:01:11] cut and then like the person is scars
[00:01:13] from ever holding a cup ever again like
[00:01:15] people will push themselves to the point
[00:01:16] not of tiredness not of exhaustion not a
[00:01:19] fatigue not at the point that they
[00:01:20] should rest but way beyond that point
[00:01:22] and they'll cycle through that point
[00:01:24] again and again and again through
[00:01:25] burnout to get to the point where now
[00:01:27] they're just like completely depleted
[00:01:29] especially in Asian countries where
[00:01:30] there's a lot of pressure to just have
[00:01:31] that like success of whatever that means
[00:01:34] so self-care is underrated really
[00:01:37] underrated
[00:01:38] hell yeah
[00:01:40] hell no in terms of the decision-making
[00:01:41] uh practice I'm presuming this is
[00:01:44] definitely underrated yeah yeah there
[00:01:46] are so many decisions that you can make
[00:01:48] that are so much simpler when you've
[00:01:49] realized that this decision doesn't
[00:01:51] require me to think too much because the
[00:01:54] consequence of failure versus the
[00:01:55] potential benefit is not significant
[00:01:58] enough for this question for this
[00:02:00] decision to be that meaningful the idea
[00:02:02] is that if it's not a hell yeah or how
[00:02:03] no decision then it doesn't really
[00:02:04] matter just make the decision and go
[00:02:06] with it it's not worth just like mulling
[00:02:08] over it too much and oh this is a really
[00:02:10] really complicated field I don't want to
[00:02:11] go into it too deep because to keep it
[00:02:12] brief but overall look it up underrated
[00:02:16] studying ahead of class yeah definitely
[00:02:19] underrated but you don't have to like be
[00:02:21] studying everything ahead of class I
[00:02:23] think the issue is that most people
[00:02:25] don't know how to study ahead of class
[00:02:27] in a way that's effective for them that
[00:02:30] is good priming when people study ahead
[00:02:31] of class they still study at lower
[00:02:33] orders ahead of class and that is
[00:02:36] honestly like a little bit pointless
[00:02:38] like there is still a benefit but that
[00:02:40] amount of time could have been used for
[00:02:41] something that's so much more productive
[00:02:43] and people aren't used to working with
[00:02:45] purely higher order structures before
[00:02:47] filling in lower order detail but if you
[00:02:49] were able to do that then that method of
[00:02:52] Presidio priming is very helpful and
[00:02:53] also all the ways that I teach about
[00:02:54] pre-studio priming any of my other
[00:02:56] videos
[00:02:57] are teaching the more effective way FYI
[00:02:59] virtual meetings
[00:03:03] people hate virtual meetings
[00:03:07] I think they're underrated because
[00:03:09] people hate them
[00:03:10] I don't love having virtual meetings but
[00:03:13] honestly like be being able to have a
[00:03:15] virtual meeting saves so much times like
[00:03:17] you know like physical meaning always
[00:03:18] takes more time and yes you're losing
[00:03:20] out on these other benefits yes I
[00:03:22] understand that and if you're only doing
[00:03:23] virtual meetings I know it's like kind
[00:03:25] of
[00:03:26] you know it kind of affects you but like
[00:03:29] it's it's still like a good thing like
[00:03:31] you know you're able to work remotely
[00:03:32] you're able to you know interact with
[00:03:34] all these other people and not have to
[00:03:35] like imagine if virtual meetings didn't
[00:03:37] exist
[00:03:38] like what would your life look like you
[00:03:39] know would you be able to even do the
[00:03:40] work that you do could you interact with
[00:03:42] the people that you interact with for
[00:03:43] that reason I'd say it's underrated even
[00:03:44] though people hate them it's like it's
[00:03:46] necessary evil
[00:03:48] New Zealand New Zealand is
[00:03:51] um
[00:03:52] hmm you know what
[00:03:56] you know what I I like living in New
[00:03:59] Zealand you know I live in New Zealand
[00:04:00] not because I have to but because I I
[00:04:02] want to I think it's a beautiful country
[00:04:05] I think in a lot of ways though I think
[00:04:07] it is overrated I think it's always that
[00:04:08] grass is greener on the other side type
[00:04:10] of thing and I say this knowing that the
[00:04:12] entire world sees New Zealand as almost
[00:04:13] like this Utopia I think anyway I think
[00:04:16] that's the impression that a lot of
[00:04:17] people have is like this like like a
[00:04:19] beautiful amazing place where like
[00:04:21] everything is really great and the
[00:04:22] healthcare is free and that's good the
[00:04:25] fact that Healthcare is free is good
[00:04:27] um like I'd much rather live in New
[00:04:29] Zealand than in the US for example where
[00:04:30] like I don't know if I get hit by a car
[00:04:32] I'll probably just die
[00:04:34] um but uh there's a lot of stuff that
[00:04:37] goes on in terms of New Zealand's like
[00:04:38] policy like Politics as well as
[00:04:42] um like the nature of the policies and
[00:04:44] sort of internalize and
[00:04:46] institutionalized racism
[00:04:48] um the climate change policies and level
[00:04:51] of proactiveness it's like this clean
[00:04:52] green image is like hmm do we really
[00:04:55] deserve that really or are we just
[00:04:57] writing off of it because the country
[00:04:58] naturally happens to be beautiful and
[00:05:00] we've got such a small population that
[00:05:01] these problems don't seem too massive
[00:05:03] yeah
[00:05:04] so a little overrated I think
[00:05:07] but still great
[00:05:09] manifestation
[00:05:11] I feel like I'm going to get hated on by
[00:05:13] like every single
[00:05:15] um I don't know like Tick Tock Instagram
[00:05:19] um like I don't even know what you call
[00:05:21] them they're just influencers for the
[00:05:22] sake of influencing
[00:05:24] um but I think it's like super overrated
[00:05:27] I really think it's very overrated I I
[00:05:30] think I don't I don't see the benefit of
[00:05:33] like all this manifestation stuff that
[00:05:35] is better than just doing like proper
[00:05:37] goal setting and planning you know like
[00:05:40] you get all the benefits you know it
[00:05:42] allows you to like focus in and
[00:05:43] centralize in and visualize where you
[00:05:45] want to go and think about it critically
[00:05:47] and then and make sure that everything
[00:05:48] is aligned to it but at least in that
[00:05:50] when you do proper goal setting and
[00:05:52] planning for it you're actually aligning
[00:05:55] your actions and behavior for it as well
[00:05:56] whereas manifestation can be Broad and
[00:05:59] some people are like literally thinking
[00:06:00] they can manifest anything by just like
[00:06:02] speaking it into the universe
[00:06:04] well let's do this you speak into the
[00:06:07] universe I'll do things we'll meet up in
[00:06:09] 10 years and see where we got okay let's
[00:06:11] just empirically test it
[00:06:16] Feynman technique I think it's
[00:06:17] pronounced but uh a fireman technique is
[00:06:21] underrated the fireman method is very
[00:06:23] good it's a great introductory way of
[00:06:25] learning about how you can actually
[00:06:27] start breaking into some levels of
[00:06:28] higher order relational thinking in a
[00:06:30] very simple easy to understand set of
[00:06:32] instructions
[00:06:33] again and this is kind of the the case
[00:06:35] with any type of self-regulated learning
[00:06:37] technique is that there's always nuances
[00:06:39] and there's always different ways that
[00:06:40] it can go like you can try to do the
[00:06:42] technique but you can interpret it wrong
[00:06:43] or you might not be able to do the
[00:06:45] processing required to get the benefit
[00:06:46] from it and then you wouldn't find it
[00:06:47] very effective and so from an individual
[00:06:50] level there's lots of other things to
[00:06:51] consider but generally if you're just
[00:06:53] shotgunning an approach if I was talking
[00:06:55] to like a a 13 year old or a 14 year old
[00:06:58] that's just getting into study
[00:07:00] strategies for the very first time
[00:07:01] finding technique would be definitely
[00:07:03] maybe top 10 on the list of things that
[00:07:05] I'll get them to start working with
[00:07:09] yeah okay well look I think most people
[00:07:11] if you're watching this video you
[00:07:13] potentially subscribe to me uh and if
[00:07:16] you subscribe to me you probably already
[00:07:18] know what my views are on Space
[00:07:19] repetition let me be super clear
[00:07:22] space repetition is overrated
[00:07:25] space repetition is necessary you can't
[00:07:27] avoid it but you shouldn't abuse it you
[00:07:30] need to know how to use it correctly and
[00:07:31] you need to know how to use it for the
[00:07:33] right types of knowledge you cannot
[00:07:35] space repetition your way you cannot
[00:07:38] wrote spaced repetition your way to
[00:07:40] success right like just think about how
[00:07:44] easy it would be to succeed if that's
[00:07:46] all you needed to do especially now with
[00:07:48] AI low order learning is becoming less
[00:07:50] and less valuable anyway data
[00:07:52] availability and just knowing things is
[00:07:54] going to be less and less important
[00:07:55] space repetition if you're not using it
[00:07:58] use it if you're not using it use it if
[00:08:02] you are using it you're probably using
[00:08:03] it enough already you don't have to do
[00:08:05] more and more so
[00:08:08] having some lower order space repetition
[00:08:10] active recall just retrieval practice
[00:08:13] coverage is good once you've covered it
[00:08:15] you're done you don't have to just keep
[00:08:17] covering it more work on the other
[00:08:19] things that are going to increase your
[00:08:20] initial encoding or your ability to have
[00:08:22] interleaved retrieval or higher orders
[00:08:24] of retrieval those are the things that
[00:08:25] are going to get you more bang for buck
[00:08:28] roof assignments uh yeah they're
[00:08:30] overrated for sure because most people
[00:08:32] in your group are not pulling their
[00:08:33] weight and and number two most people
[00:08:35] that are giving you the assignments
[00:08:36] don't really know if their time is even
[00:08:38] going to help you in the first place uh
[00:08:40] and then number three they're often very
[00:08:42] annoying logistically and just to get
[00:08:44] your head around to try to complete them
[00:08:46] there are some exceptions obviously but
[00:08:48] just as a blanket statement and I'm
[00:08:50] saying this like I've looked through
[00:08:52] lots of different curriculums and I've
[00:08:54] looked through different ways that
[00:08:55] Educators and different institutions at
[00:08:57] both secondary and tertiary education
[00:09:00] tend to think about assignments well I
[00:09:03] don't think it's very well thought out
[00:09:04] in a lot of ways so I'm going to say in
[00:09:06] general group assignments are kind of
[00:09:08] overrated they can be really tokenistic
[00:09:10] as well gaming
[00:09:13] gaming
[00:09:15] I mean gaming is so hyped at the moment
[00:09:17] right like it's such a popular thing
[00:09:19] like
[00:09:20] um I think gaming is properly rated
[00:09:24] it's fun I like gaming
[00:09:26] um you know if you're addicted that's
[00:09:28] not good but so is being addicted to
[00:09:30] anything I think it gets a bad rip
[00:09:33] um but I don't think that bad rep is
[00:09:36] necessarily deserved actually so I'm
[00:09:39] gonna say that it's super hype and it
[00:09:41] has a bad rip property rated
[00:09:44] study groups
[00:09:46] study groups are generally underrated I
[00:09:50] think people tend to avoid study groups
[00:09:51] in some situations because they haven't
[00:09:53] had good experiences with study groups
[00:09:54] before and as a result they don't feel
[00:09:57] like they
[00:09:58] will get benefit from it so they avoid
[00:10:01] it but I think if you know how to use
[00:10:03] study groups in the right way and you
[00:10:06] know how to sort of facilitate it with
[00:10:08] each other then I think study groups can
[00:10:09] be really beneficial actually
[00:10:11] so yeah underrated
[00:10:13] so that's it for this episode of
[00:10:14] overrated underrated if there's anything
[00:10:16] that I mentioned that you want me to
[00:10:17] dive into in more detail please leave a
[00:10:19] comment down below let me know what it
[00:10:21] is that you want me to dive into and
[00:10:22] also specify the question about what
[00:10:26] aspect of it you want me to dive into in
[00:10:28] the very very first overrated underrated
[00:10:29] video that we did for this I just said
[00:10:32] leave a comment below on what you want
[00:10:33] me to expand on people just said like
[00:10:34] the word expand on it and I was like
[00:10:36] what about it so that that was my fault
[00:10:38] this time be a little bit more specific
[00:10:40] but anyway thank you for watching if you
[00:10:41] like this stuff leave a like leave a
[00:10:43] comment make sure to subscribe and I'll
[00:10:44] catch you in the next one
[00:10:51] thank you

=== Why Nootropics are OVERRATED... ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R6mE0FI-Rw

[00:00:00] I don't really think that nootropics are
[00:00:03] probably as hyped up as they are
[00:00:05] marketed to be personally I think that
[00:00:06] they can probably boost performance for
[00:00:09] some people especially in the short term
[00:00:10] and so what's probably happening is that
[00:00:13] there is some level of individual
[00:00:14] variation right potentially they're
[00:00:16] either getting a longer or stronger
[00:00:18] placebo effect which is again like it's
[00:00:21] still an effect right or they're more
[00:00:23] sensitive to the ingredients both as
[00:00:25] possible but either way as long as it's
[00:00:27] not harming someone I think it's just
[00:00:30] fine one of the big dangers is that if
[00:00:32] you're on existing medication and you
[00:00:34] take something those ingredients will
[00:00:36] you know there's a higher chance that it
[00:00:37] might interact with the medication so
[00:00:39] check with your doctor beforehand


=== The Surprising Connection between Learning Skills and Self Worth ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ_ShfX-uGU

[00:00:00] beliefs you form about yourself who you
[00:00:02] are what you're capable of your
[00:00:03] potential what you can or cannot achieve
[00:00:05] and how to some extent your sense of
[00:00:06] self-worth as well a lot of that is
[00:00:08] actually attached to your perspective of
[00:00:10] how well you can learn your experiences
[00:00:11] through school how well you've done in
[00:00:13] exams how well you have performed how
[00:00:14] you're struggling compared to your
[00:00:16] friends when you're trying to learn
[00:00:16] something your ability to work with new
[00:00:18] information you've studied this thing
[00:00:19] you're trying to learn it you know all
[00:00:20] of those things feed into your sense of
[00:00:22] like sort of self-belief


=== How to make the most out of uni resources? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YBjx3iTKkY

[00:00:00] the way that I've seen most people use
[00:00:02] lecturers it's kind of like a waste of
[00:00:04] time because the questions that are
[00:00:06] being asked the lecturers are the ones
[00:00:07] that are very very basic surface level
[00:00:09] you really should be aiming to have
[00:00:11] self-regulated learning skills to the
[00:00:13] point where you don't need help with
[00:00:14] those simple level questions the way
[00:00:17] that I like to use questions is to test
[00:00:20] hypotheses or check things that I have
[00:00:22] synthesized together that is almost
[00:00:25] impossible to really figure it out for
[00:00:27] myself try to develop the skills to
[00:00:29] figure out all the basic stuff by
[00:00:31] yourself use expertise for where
[00:00:33] expertise is needed


=== The harsh truth about learning research ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpBPgGw0izU

[00:00:00] there is this existing normative belief
[00:00:02] around what learning is and how learning
[00:00:04] should be that is really sort of odd
[00:00:06] because it's actually not very logical
[00:00:07] to think about learning as occurring
[00:00:09] that way yet it is the way that everyone
[00:00:11] thinks about intuitively it's illogical
[00:00:13] yet the normative belief people have a
[00:00:15] lot of times what people don't realize
[00:00:16] is that the researchers they're not
[00:00:18] doing research to help you they do
[00:00:20] research to figure out why the brain
[00:00:23] works the way it does or what what
[00:00:25] happens and then it's just an offshoot
[00:00:27] of that kind of small subset of that
[00:00:29] which is like oh this is actually
[00:00:30] practical or what other practical
[00:00:32] implications of that and I think in
[00:00:33] recent years researchers have especially
[00:00:35] in learning Sciences area have done more
[00:00:38] of that more Outreach more like hey wait
[00:00:40] a second why are our textbooks designed
[00:00:41] like this why are teachers doing this
[00:00:43] why are students doing that but that is
[00:00:45] not the primary purpose that most
[00:00:46] research goes on you know that's not why
[00:00:49] people are writing papers that's not how
[00:00:50] people further their careers really


=== Are Nootropics Worth Buying? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_15tA17Fo

[00:00:00] this is how I think you should think
[00:00:02] about nootropics in order for a
[00:00:04] nootropic to be worth it for your money
[00:00:06] the effect needs to be significant
[00:00:08] enough for it to be worth it obviously
[00:00:10] but the effect is actually something
[00:00:12] that you are measuring subjectively
[00:00:15] yourself if you feel like something is
[00:00:17] helping you and you feel like it works
[00:00:19] and therefore you feel like it's worth
[00:00:21] your money it doesn't actually really
[00:00:24] matter what studies or research says
[00:00:27] because you are making the value
[00:00:28] judgment that it's worth it for yourself
[00:00:30] and that's actually important there are
[00:00:31] lots of things that you know people will
[00:00:33] do because it makes them feel better
[00:00:35] they are creating the placebo effect for
[00:00:37] themselves and in some ways it's
[00:00:39] actually smart it's finding ways that
[00:00:41] you can tap into these powerful
[00:00:44] psychological effects that your mind is
[00:00:46] able to produce at the end of the day
[00:00:48] what matters is how you feel about it
[00:00:49] and the outcomes that you're getting


=== What to do if medicine doesn't align with you? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sh0fwPt2nc

[00:00:00] they know that doctors are resistant to
[00:00:02] leaving medicine and a lot of that you
[00:00:04] know for some of those people it's
[00:00:05] because they do feel like they align
[00:00:06] with medicine and we're just totally
[00:00:07] fine you know I think a lot of people
[00:00:08] misunderstand my messages like you
[00:00:10] should quit medicine but it's not right
[00:00:11] it's like meaning yeah yeah if it's not
[00:00:14] for you then you know by all means you
[00:00:16] know you have the option don't like
[00:00:17] don't kill yourself literally you know
[00:00:20] um there's there's other options and it
[00:00:21] takes a bit of work it's not as hard as
[00:00:22] hating your life for years right
[00:00:24] nothing's harder than that


=== The trick to remembering everything you study ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7obXUgx_hOM

[00:00:00] the reason why a lot of the time you'll
[00:00:02] be studying and studying and studying
[00:00:03] and then a week later you've forgotten
[00:00:05] half or more of what you've learned
[00:00:07] because when you learned it it wasn't
[00:00:09] relevant and so the trick to effective
[00:00:13] learning basically all the principles of
[00:00:15] efficient learning are about getting
[00:00:17] your brain to not prune and get rid of
[00:00:21] information that it thinks is not worth
[00:00:23] keeping and the way we do that is to in
[00:00:25] a way trick the brain into thinking that
[00:00:28] it's worth keeping and the way we do
[00:00:29] that is through creating connections and
[00:00:32] relationships


=== The TRUTH about Natural Therapies ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDPSc7Aa11E

[00:00:00] so here's something that you need to
[00:00:01] know about supplements natural therapies
[00:00:03] all of this sort of stuff way back in
[00:00:05] the day there were all these you know
[00:00:06] plants and herbs and stuff they were
[00:00:07] just ground up mixed with some pepper
[00:00:09] you know cook it over your fireplace and
[00:00:11] you drink that and you feel better we
[00:00:12] studied that right we put our science
[00:00:14] head-on we looked at that we distilled
[00:00:17] it and then we turned it into a
[00:00:19] medication so Western medication is
[00:00:22] essentially the distilled refined
[00:00:24] versions of the stuff that worked but it
[00:00:27] all started from you know like natural
[00:00:29] stuff but because science is constantly
[00:00:31] extracting the things that work from the
[00:00:33] natural stuff over time in the modern
[00:00:36] day the stuff that is considered more
[00:00:38] Natural Therapy naturopathic stuff they
[00:00:41] tend to be stuff that is more mild less
[00:00:43] consistent potentially more dangerous or
[00:00:45] in some cases legitimately it just does
[00:00:47] not work it's just completely placebo


=== Here’s the CORRECT way to do cramming ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQHo2hsQu6A

[00:00:00] cramming is effective in a lot of ways
[00:00:03] it puts our brain instead of urgency and
[00:00:05] it makes us work through the material
[00:00:06] faster and because we're covering more
[00:00:08] topics in a single session it means that
[00:00:10] we're able to find Connections in
[00:00:11] relationships between those Concepts
[00:00:13] that we might have otherwise missed if
[00:00:14] they were presented to us week by week
[00:00:16] in isolated silos
[00:00:19] however cramming is often done poorly
[00:00:22] because we do it all the way at the very
[00:00:23] end when the assignment or the exam is
[00:00:25] due if we simply just do the exact same
[00:00:27] process but we do it at the beginning it
[00:00:30] means that now we've got more free time
[00:00:32] more flexibility and we can either enjoy
[00:00:35] life and do other things


=== Zettelkasten won't work unless you do this... ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6uLcSprPic

[00:00:00] the problem that I have was little
[00:00:01] castle is actually not a problem I have
[00:00:03] with Zito casting as a system the
[00:00:04] problem that I have is that zero casting
[00:00:06] is only effective when your ability to
[00:00:08] process and prioritize the relationships
[00:00:11] is done correctly it's very dependent on
[00:00:13] your deep processing ability so if
[00:00:15] you're someone that has only used to
[00:00:16] lower order learning in low order
[00:00:17] thinking and they're creating low
[00:00:19] quality relationships and connections
[00:00:21] then the network that they create using
[00:00:23] the zerocast system method will also be
[00:00:25] low quality and so they will be very
[00:00:27] limited in the benefit that they get
[00:00:29] from it therefore I think the first step
[00:00:31] regardless of what method you're using
[00:00:33] is to get good at the cognitive skill of
[00:00:35] Higher Learning the main benefit only
[00:00:37] comes once you have a good deprocessing
[00:00:39] ability yourself first


=== How I Ranked 1st at Monash University: 4-step Framework ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z7frfjiEcM

[00:00:00] I recently graduated at the top of my
[00:00:01] class with my master of education
[00:00:03] program at Monash University which is
[00:00:05] one of the top ranked universities in
[00:00:06] the world and in this video I'm going to
[00:00:08] be sharing with you four kind of
[00:00:10] uncommon things that I did that allowed
[00:00:12] me to place first and at the end of this
[00:00:15] video I'm also going to be sharing with
[00:00:16] you one thing that I didn't do that I
[00:00:19] see a lot of people doing that would
[00:00:21] have made all four of those things
[00:00:23] basically useless so stay tuned to find
[00:00:26] out by the way if you are wondering
[00:00:28] where I am this is not a Swanky new
[00:00:31] office I wish I had a Swank in the
[00:00:33] office it looked like this but actually
[00:00:34] this is just the Airbnb that we're
[00:00:35] staying at I'm in LA right now final day
[00:00:37] of my US tour meeting up with a bunch of
[00:00:40] students it's been a good time heading
[00:00:41] to Singapore next but I'm ready to go
[00:00:43] back home okay so before we start a
[00:00:46] little bit of context the program I did
[00:00:47] was the master of education and general
[00:00:49] educational studies and going into it I
[00:00:51] set myself a goal I wanted to be able to
[00:00:54] complete the program and get very good
[00:00:56] results while spending significantly
[00:00:58] less time than normal and other people
[00:01:00] would spend on studying because
[00:01:03] you know I've got a channel I've got a
[00:01:06] reputation I guess to try to prove I
[00:01:07] wanted to show my methods in action and
[00:01:09] actually I already created videos on
[00:01:11] some of those methods which you can
[00:01:12] check out those videos do tell you how I
[00:01:15] studied for it and it's an accurate
[00:01:16] depiction of the way that I studied all
[00:01:19] my material by the end of the year I won
[00:01:20] the dean's award for academic Excellence
[00:01:22] which is given the top graduating
[00:01:23] student of the cohort my work was taken
[00:01:26] as the Exemplar for high distinction
[00:01:28] which is the highest possible grade for
[00:01:30] half of my papers I was the first
[00:01:32] student to ever receive a hundred
[00:01:34] percent in one of those papers and for
[00:01:36] one of my assignments the lecturer said
[00:01:39] that it was a waste to use it as an
[00:01:41] assignment so they actually created an
[00:01:42] entire new method of assessment that
[00:01:45] will allow me to get the grade by just
[00:01:47] getting it published somewhere instead
[00:01:49] before I graduated I was invited back to
[00:01:52] be a lecturer and I did all of this
[00:01:55] online through remote learning in fact
[00:01:57] the first time I visited the actual
[00:01:58] campus was to run a workshop for the
[00:02:01] upcoming Masters and PhD students I now
[00:02:03] now continue to guest lecture at Monash
[00:02:06] University teaching learning skills
[00:02:07] working with Masters and PhD students in
[00:02:09] education and Monash university has
[00:02:12] recently agreed to be our more research
[00:02:14] partner for I can study which is my
[00:02:16] company that teaches all of these skills
[00:02:18] to measure these methods and publish on
[00:02:22] their success and I did all of this in
[00:02:24] about 15 of the recommended time or how
[00:02:27] long other people were studying in fact
[00:02:29] if you look at just the amount of time I
[00:02:31] spent studying and taking away all the
[00:02:33] time on just literally writing essays
[00:02:35] and assignments I probably only spent
[00:02:37] about 40 hours across the entire year of
[00:02:41] proper reading and studying and without
[00:02:43] these four ways I would not have been
[00:02:46] able to do that now a disclaimer these
[00:02:49] four things they will work for basically
[00:02:51] any subject that you want to use this
[00:02:54] for basically any curriculum any
[00:02:56] structure however they do require you to
[00:02:59] have certain number of skills in place
[00:03:01] now obviously I had these skills but if
[00:03:03] you struggle struggle with these steps
[00:03:05] then you can train yourself to reach
[00:03:07] them start with a simpler version tone
[00:03:09] them down but aim to reach this
[00:03:11] eventually and I promise you you're all
[00:03:14] capable of reaching this level with a
[00:03:16] little bit of practice over time I can
[00:03:18] say that with confidence because
[00:03:18] training these skills is actually what I
[00:03:21] do for a living so let's get started
[00:03:23] with number one now the first thing is
[00:03:25] to aim high and this seems like obvious
[00:03:28] advice but you really have nothing to
[00:03:31] lose from aiming higher than you think
[00:03:33] you're capable of achieving on top of
[00:03:35] actually setting Higher Goals and
[00:03:37] pushing yourself to try a little bit
[00:03:39] harder it also makes you think
[00:03:40] fundamentally differently there used to
[00:03:42] be these really popular bracelets and I
[00:03:43] don't know if they're still popular
[00:03:44] anymore but it used to say
[00:03:46] wwjd and it stood for what would Jesus
[00:03:49] do it was really really popular because
[00:03:51] it was a way for people to think like ah
[00:03:53] what would the characteristics and
[00:03:56] attributes of in this case Jesus
[00:03:58] B in my situation and I think this is a
[00:04:02] really good reframing technique because
[00:04:03] it's very difficult for us to think
[00:04:05] about what we should do from our
[00:04:08] perspective and it can be easier to
[00:04:09] think what would someone else do that
[00:04:12] was able to achieve this so when we aim
[00:04:14] high we can think about what type of
[00:04:17] behaviors actions characteristics
[00:04:19] someone that could achieve at that level
[00:04:21] would do and then we can try to copy
[00:04:24] them and thinking about it in this way
[00:04:25] can help us study smarter rather than
[00:04:27] just harder it makes us evaluate our own
[00:04:30] bad habits and catch ourselves on things
[00:04:33] that we might doing purely because we
[00:04:35] have been used to doing them and we've
[00:04:37] been doing them for years and years even
[00:04:39] though in the back of our mind we really
[00:04:41] know it's not going to be helpful for us
[00:04:43] because we know that a truly Elite
[00:04:45] student probably isn't doing that it's
[00:04:48] going to make us look for Alternatives
[00:04:50] and you know they always say shoot for
[00:04:52] the moon and fall on the Stars if you
[00:04:55] aim high worst case scenario you just
[00:04:58] won't hit that at goal but you're
[00:05:00] probably going to do better than you
[00:05:01] would have anyway by the way I've never
[00:05:03] really understood that saying because
[00:05:04] the Moon is significantly closer than
[00:05:06] all the stars that we see in the sky
[00:05:07] septu is a simple one it is to cram yes
[00:05:11] cram but cram early I made sure at the
[00:05:14] beginning of every semester to put aside
[00:05:16] two weeks where I was going to go
[00:05:18] through all the content for all the
[00:05:20] papers as much as I could now I didn't
[00:05:22] have all the resources available I
[00:05:24] didn't have all the lecture materials
[00:05:26] they weren't released in advance I had
[00:05:28] lecture objectives to work with I knew
[00:05:31] the textbook that they were going to use
[00:05:32] and I knew the general gist of what was
[00:05:34] going to be covered so I let myself use
[00:05:36] that as a guiding Stone to get as much
[00:05:38] pre-study done as possible and cramming
[00:05:41] is effective in a lot of ways it puts
[00:05:44] our brain instead of urgency and it
[00:05:45] makes us work through the material
[00:05:46] faster and because we're covering more
[00:05:48] topics in a single session it means that
[00:05:50] we're able to find connections and
[00:05:52] relationships between those Concepts
[00:05:53] that we might have otherwise missed if
[00:05:55] they were presented to us week by week
[00:05:57] in isolated silos
[00:06:00] however cramming is often done poorly
[00:06:03] because we do it all the way at the very
[00:06:04] end when the assignment or the exam is
[00:06:06] due and that puts unnecessary stress and
[00:06:08] pressure on us if we simply just do the
[00:06:10] exact same process but we do it at the
[00:06:12] beginning it means that now we've got
[00:06:14] more free time more flexibility and we
[00:06:17] can either enjoy life and do other
[00:06:19] things for me I was still working
[00:06:21] full-time you know this has happened
[00:06:23] over the last year and a half basically
[00:06:25] so all the stuff that I've been doing
[00:06:26] that you've been seeing on my YouTube I
[00:06:28] was doing all of that concurrently while
[00:06:30] studying for my master of education so
[00:06:32] for me it was really really important to
[00:06:34] save as much time as possible I know
[00:06:37] that some of you watching you've got
[00:06:38] young family you've got kids you've got
[00:06:40] a mortgage to pay you've got a job that
[00:06:42] you're working full-time while also
[00:06:43] trying to study full-time and the trick
[00:06:46] is going to be about making sure you can
[00:06:48] clean out and save some of those days by
[00:06:51] doing your cramming as early as possible
[00:06:53] when you're working ahead doing that
[00:06:55] early cramming you have to do it the
[00:06:57] right way
[00:06:58] let me explain there's a few things that
[00:07:00] we need to think about here so this line
[00:07:02] is a timeline of learning here all right
[00:07:05] time then different types of information
[00:07:07] are more useful for our brain depending
[00:07:11] on what stage of learning we're at so in
[00:07:14] the earlier stages our brain is craving
[00:07:16] more structure it doesn't do well with
[00:07:19] lots of fine details it doesn't do well
[00:07:22] with all those facts and figures and
[00:07:23] statistics and definitions what it wants
[00:07:25] to know is how to think about the topic
[00:07:28] compared to the later stages where then
[00:07:31] it's going to be a lot better to take in
[00:07:33] all of those details because those
[00:07:35] details now become more relevant and
[00:07:38] this is just all about Connections and
[00:07:40] this is what research on human cognitive
[00:07:42] architecture tells us at the beginning
[00:07:43] our brain has a prior set of knowledge
[00:07:47] and connections and networks which allow
[00:07:49] it to make sense of information now if a
[00:07:52] new piece of information comes in and we
[00:07:54] cannot see how they might be connected
[00:07:56] to what we already know then it becomes
[00:07:59] very difficult to make it relevant which
[00:08:02] means that our brain doesn't see what
[00:08:03] the point is of holding on to it which
[00:08:06] is why we would very quickly forget it
[00:08:09] and this is the reason why a lot of the
[00:08:11] time you'll be studying and studying and
[00:08:13] studying and then a week later you've
[00:08:14] forgotten half or more of what you've
[00:08:16] learned because when you learned it it
[00:08:19] wasn't relevant and so the trick to
[00:08:22] effective learning basically all the
[00:08:24] principles of efficient learning are are
[00:08:26] about getting your brain to not prune
[00:08:29] and get rid of information that it
[00:08:32] thinks is not worth keeping and the way
[00:08:34] we do that is to in a way trick the
[00:08:36] brain into thinking that it's worth
[00:08:38] keeping and the way we do that is
[00:08:40] through creating connections and
[00:08:42] relationships so at the very very
[00:08:44] beginning when you're first learning
[00:08:45] about a subject what we want to do is we
[00:08:47] want to find those key pieces of
[00:08:49] information throughout the entire text
[00:08:51] of what we're learning that we know are
[00:08:53] slightly more relevant and familiar
[00:08:56] compared to the knowledge that we all
[00:08:58] already have and this allows us to
[00:09:01] create what I often call Anchor points
[00:09:03] of relevance that means that when we get
[00:09:05] new information coming in after that we
[00:09:08] now know how it's connected because
[00:09:09] we've got more points to connect it with
[00:09:11] and then as we continue to learn more we
[00:09:14] can connect it to more and more points
[00:09:16] so in a way what we're saying is that
[00:09:18] the easiest way to learn something new
[00:09:20] is to have prior knowledge on it already
[00:09:22] you can't always apply knowledge and
[00:09:24] everything so what we do is that we
[00:09:25] build prior knowledge which I know
[00:09:28] sounds impossible and I guess
[00:09:30] technically if you really get into
[00:09:32] definitions it is impossible but
[00:09:34] hopefully you get the gist it's about
[00:09:35] taking the level you're at now and then
[00:09:37] learning just enough to take you to the
[00:09:39] next level which allows the next level
[00:09:41] to be more relevant and the next level
[00:09:42] to be more relevant so that eventually
[00:09:44] you can cover all of the content down to
[00:09:46] the finest detail but each step feels
[00:09:49] relevant because you're building on the
[00:09:51] knowledge of the previous step and it
[00:09:52] often means that you have to go out of
[00:09:54] order skipping huge amounts of material
[00:09:56] as you go on your first passes through
[00:09:58] the material real there is a time to
[00:10:01] learn everything and knowing when is the
[00:10:03] right time is something that makes a
[00:10:06] enormous difference if you spend all of
[00:10:08] your time at the early stages committing
[00:10:09] to details and definitions and trying to
[00:10:11] memorize everything then there's no
[00:10:12] point because a few weeks later you're
[00:10:14] gonna have forgotten it anyway you're
[00:10:16] still not going to know how to think
[00:10:17] about it you're still not going to know
[00:10:18] how it's all related together because
[00:10:20] you haven't been able to consolidate it
[00:10:22] a lot of people say that you should go
[00:10:23] and memorize things first and then
[00:10:25] consolidate it afterwards but that
[00:10:27] doesn't actually make sense you cannot
[00:10:29] learn it first and consolidate it
[00:10:30] afterwards at least not efficiently
[00:10:31] Because by the time you come to
[00:10:33] consolidating it you've already
[00:10:35] forgotten a lot of it that's how good
[00:10:37] and efficient your brain is at for
[00:10:39] getting information that's why the most
[00:10:41] efficient way is to make sure that we're
[00:10:43] consolidating it at the time we are
[00:10:45] learning it in fact some fascinating
[00:10:47] Neuroscience research has shown that the
[00:10:49] quality of your memory later in the
[00:10:51] future can be predicted at least
[00:10:54] partially by the type of activity your
[00:10:56] brain underwent at the first time at
[00:10:58] learned it which means is that how we
[00:10:59] think about information now when we
[00:11:01] first consume it dictates how well we're
[00:11:04] going to know that information later
[00:11:06] which is also kind of logical if you
[00:11:09] think about it so ignore those details
[00:11:10] at the beginning when I was going
[00:11:12] through and if you watch my other videos
[00:11:14] when I'm actually studying it you'll see
[00:11:15] that I'm putting this in practice I'm
[00:11:16] getting a big picture understanding and
[00:11:18] then each iteration I'm just building
[00:11:20] the complexity and depth and detail of
[00:11:23] that information if I run out of time
[00:11:24] that's fine because I've gotten the most
[00:11:26] important stuff done first if I really
[00:11:29] need to cram in those details I can do
[00:11:31] that a week or two before the exam just
[00:11:33] Chuck it into that short-term memory
[00:11:34] cram the details in and even if I forget
[00:11:36] it a couple weeks later it's all good
[00:11:38] because I wouldn't even need it a couple
[00:11:39] weeks later so it's about being
[00:11:41] strategic with what information you
[00:11:43] learn at what stage of your learning
[00:11:46] process and this is crucial for
[00:11:48] Effective learning if you don't follow
[00:11:50] these principles I don't think it's
[00:11:52] realistic to do well at least at a
[00:11:55] higher level especially you know for
[00:11:57] those of you that are in University or
[00:11:58] those of you that are in high school
[00:11:59] that are struggling with this this is
[00:12:01] going to flip your world upside down so
[00:12:04] how do we actually do this well you can
[00:12:06] look at my other video to see some of
[00:12:07] the techniques that I use in terms of
[00:12:09] non-linear mapping and how I arrange
[00:12:10] those Concepts it's quite a bit to go
[00:12:12] through that video is going to do it
[00:12:13] more Justice than I can right now
[00:12:15] literally because I have to check out of
[00:12:16] this Airbnb in like 20 minutes I need to
[00:12:19] wrap this video up and by the way here's
[00:12:21] a very interesting thing is that we
[00:12:22] actually intuitively already know that
[00:12:24] there is a time and place to learn
[00:12:26] different types of information so for
[00:12:28] example if you were learning biology for
[00:12:30] the very very first time in your life
[00:12:32] you wouldn't say that the most efficient
[00:12:33] way to learn that is to go and read
[00:12:35] through 2000 PhD thesis to try to figure
[00:12:40] out you know basic Elementary biology
[00:12:44] it'd just be way Overkill and just go
[00:12:46] over your head you know for example if
[00:12:48] you want to learn about learning science
[00:12:49] the most efficient way to learn about
[00:12:51] learning science is not to spend years
[00:12:54] of your life going through primary
[00:12:56] research on learning science to create
[00:12:58] data system the most efficient way to
[00:13:00] learn it would actually be to join let's
[00:13:03] say a program created by someone that
[00:13:05] did spend all that time to do that and
[00:13:07] did all the trial and error for you and
[00:13:08] then packaged it in a very very nice
[00:13:10] consumable way for someone like yourself
[00:13:15] so we know that some information is
[00:13:17] going to go over our heads if it's too
[00:13:18] advanced but the trick is realizing that
[00:13:21] that happens at a micro level to even in
[00:13:23] a single lecture even in a single
[00:13:25] chapter even in a single paragraph some
[00:13:28] information is simply not suited for our
[00:13:30] brain at that time and it's better to
[00:13:33] pick the path of most relevant you will
[00:13:37] be able to cover all the information
[00:13:39] you're not going to miss anything it
[00:13:40] just means that you're going to go
[00:13:41] through it multiple times picking up
[00:13:43] different things as you go and now the
[00:13:46] fourth point and this is actually more
[00:13:47] of a pro tip but it is to be very
[00:13:48] resourceful and strategic with the way
[00:13:51] that you use your resources and the
[00:13:53] biggest resource that you have often in
[00:13:54] University setting is the staff the
[00:13:57] lecturers now the way that I've seen
[00:13:58] most people use lecturers is it's kind
[00:14:01] of like a waste of time because the
[00:14:03] questions that are being asked the
[00:14:04] lecturers are the ones that are very
[00:14:06] very basic surface level they're just
[00:14:08] saying I don't understand this can you
[00:14:09] explain it to me you know what is the
[00:14:11] meaning of this particular thing you
[00:14:12] said this in the lecture what does that
[00:14:13] mean you really should be aiming have
[00:14:15] self-regulated learning skills to the
[00:14:17] point where you don't need help with
[00:14:19] those simple level questions these are
[00:14:21] the types of problems that you need to
[00:14:22] have the skill to be able to figure out
[00:14:24] yourself like you shouldn't really have
[00:14:25] to ask someone else for low level
[00:14:28] information like that you can either
[00:14:29] look it up yourself and learn the skills
[00:14:32] of looking things up or learn the
[00:14:35] process of self-explanation and
[00:14:37] generation now this is obviously for a
[00:14:40] more mature set of Learners like if you
[00:14:42] are listening to this right now and
[00:14:44] you're like 11 12 years old yeah asking
[00:14:47] your teachers about things is going to
[00:14:48] be really important part of your
[00:14:49] learning strategy but even then we
[00:14:52] should be aiming to get to a point where
[00:14:54] we don't really need to be asking for
[00:14:56] very simple information it's a war skill
[00:15:00] that's going to transfer through for the
[00:15:02] rest of your life the way that I like to
[00:15:03] use questions is to test hypotheses or
[00:15:07] check things that I have synthesized
[00:15:09] together that is almost impossible to
[00:15:12] really figure it out for myself so for
[00:15:14] example people for one of my papers we
[00:15:16] were introduced to like 13 different
[00:15:18] models for adopting new Innovations and
[00:15:22] new Innovative educational Frameworks
[00:15:24] and Technologies and all 13 Frameworks
[00:15:26] we were meant to kind of learn them and
[00:15:28] see some of the trends and the
[00:15:29] similarities and as I was going through
[00:15:31] them I wanted to synthesize a
[00:15:33] comprehensive framework that looked at
[00:15:34] all the different angles that the other
[00:15:36] Frameworks did so I went through and
[00:15:38] found the trends and similarities and
[00:15:40] compared and contrasted and I spent
[00:15:42] about you know pretty solid hour and a
[00:15:44] half just going through back and forth
[00:15:46] with these models to create my version
[00:15:48] of a model that I thought abided by all
[00:15:51] the considerations of the other models
[00:15:53] padded up for the weaknesses of some of
[00:15:55] the models and enhance some of the
[00:15:56] strengths of the other models and at the
[00:15:58] end of that I had this singular kind of
[00:16:00] Fairly comprehensive multi-faceted model
[00:16:02] that made sense for me it's really
[00:16:04] important that it's for me because I'm
[00:16:06] the one that put in the cognitive effort
[00:16:08] to make it make sense and therefore
[00:16:09] that's why it's going to be beneficial
[00:16:11] for learning if someone else were to
[00:16:13] just simply look at it they're not going
[00:16:14] to get you know that Enlightenment that
[00:16:16] I did because they didn't put in the
[00:16:18] work to try and understand it they're
[00:16:20] not receiving the learning because they
[00:16:21] didn't do the thinking either the
[00:16:23] thinking therefore I'm getting the
[00:16:24] learning out of it now for me to check
[00:16:26] if that model is accurate would probably
[00:16:29] take I mean that's probably honestly
[00:16:31] like a whole phd's worth of work to do
[00:16:34] that like that information is probably
[00:16:36] does not even exist anywhere because I
[00:16:37] synthesized it it's sort of new and
[00:16:39] that's what I use the lecture time for I
[00:16:41] got a meeting with the lecturer and I
[00:16:43] said hey I've been looking through all
[00:16:44] this stuff I created a model that I
[00:16:45] think for me makes a lot of sense can I
[00:16:47] run you through it and can you let me
[00:16:48] know if I'm missing something if there
[00:16:50] are any red flags if I completely
[00:16:51] misunderstood some perspectives of it I
[00:16:53] ran through the thing and they said it
[00:16:54] looks really good and in fact they
[00:16:56] invited me back to present it to the
[00:16:57] rest of the class to show as an example
[00:16:59] for other people what they should be
[00:17:00] doing when they're going through the
[00:17:02] readings so that's an example where
[00:17:04] someone with years and years of
[00:17:06] experience can look at it and say yup
[00:17:08] that makes sense in a 15-20 minute
[00:17:10] conversation whereas it would have taken
[00:17:12] me 15 to 20 months of my own and work to
[00:17:15] try to verify it now that's a strategic
[00:17:17] use of lecturer expertise time and this
[00:17:21] is the same case for when you're working
[00:17:22] with supervisors or mentors in the
[00:17:24] workplace as well try to develop the
[00:17:25] skills to figure out all the basic stuff
[00:17:27] by yourself use expertise for where
[00:17:30] expertise is needed and at least of all
[00:17:33] it's going to give your markers and
[00:17:37] supervisors a favorable impression
[00:17:39] because those types of questions are the
[00:17:41] ones that show them that you are really
[00:17:43] a high level thinker which brings us to
[00:17:46] the final point which is the one thing I
[00:17:49] didn't do that I see a lot of students
[00:17:52] doing all of the time where if I had
[00:17:55] done that all four of the things that
[00:17:57] I've just told you about would have been
[00:17:59] made redundant it wouldn't have had any
[00:18:01] real impact and that is that I did not
[00:18:04] compromise on the non-negotiables what
[00:18:08] does that mean that sounds really
[00:18:09] confusing and actually the statement is
[00:18:11] confusing let me explain at the
[00:18:12] beginning of the paper I was out of a
[00:18:15] WhatsApp group with all the other
[00:18:16] students and I very quickly realized
[00:18:18] that some of the students were really
[00:18:19] struggling with the workload they were
[00:18:21] studying a lot of hours and they were
[00:18:22] not really getting a lot of reward out
[00:18:24] of it they were struggling to understand
[00:18:25] the concepts the assignments were really
[00:18:27] stressing them out their point I
[00:18:28] essentially already finished the entire
[00:18:29] semester's worth of material and the
[00:18:32] students asked me for advice on what
[00:18:34] they should do and I told them some of
[00:18:36] the things that I've just told you right
[00:18:37] now for example you know make sure to
[00:18:39] cram early try to study ahead finish
[00:18:41] through the semester and one of the
[00:18:42] things that was very common for them to
[00:18:46] fire back with was but we don't know
[00:18:48] what's going to be covered the lectures
[00:18:50] haven't been released yet we don't have
[00:18:52] enough all we have to work with is this
[00:18:54] textbook we don't know what parts are
[00:18:55] going to be relevant all we have is that
[00:18:57] we know what the assignments are going
[00:18:59] to be about and we have a very general
[00:19:01] lecture outline but we don't know what
[00:19:03] the material is there's no slides for it
[00:19:05] yet I can't do it I can't study that way
[00:19:07] Justin but the thing is I did and that's
[00:19:10] the difference is I know that in order
[00:19:13] for me to make things work and order for
[00:19:15] me to work full-time or Beyond full-time
[00:19:17] hours while studying for my master of
[00:19:19] education which is a full-time program
[00:19:21] and to do well and to do it and only 15
[00:19:24] of the time I need to achieve my goal I
[00:19:26] needed to do that I needed to cram
[00:19:29] everything in early so for me I wanted
[00:19:31] to find the solution so I used what I
[00:19:34] could I made do what the resources I had
[00:19:36] available I used Google and Wikipedia
[00:19:39] and the textbooks and the recommended
[00:19:40] readings and whatever it is and I tried
[00:19:43] to figure it out I made an educated
[00:19:45] guess on what I think is likely to be
[00:19:47] covered even though the lecture slides
[00:19:49] aren't there I said well look I'm
[00:19:51] probably going to get at least 70
[00:19:52] percent close and the 30 I'm missing I
[00:19:56] can pick that up during the lectures but
[00:19:57] at least I've got that Head Start it's
[00:19:59] better than nothing and so I had that
[00:20:01] kind of solutions mentality I wasn't
[00:20:03] looking for reasons why I couldn't
[00:20:06] follow these rules I was looking for the
[00:20:09] path that allowed me to follow the rules
[00:20:10] because I knew that they were
[00:20:12] non-negotiables I had to do that if I
[00:20:15] was going to succeed at this task and
[00:20:18] very very very often when I'm working
[00:20:22] with students and they come to me with
[00:20:23] their concerns about things and I asked
[00:20:25] them about what they're doing with their
[00:20:27] methods and the techniques and a lot of
[00:20:28] time I've already taught them techniques
[00:20:29] and I've already taught them the methods
[00:20:31] but they say I can't do it because of
[00:20:33] this reason my commute is too long I'm
[00:20:36] spending too much you know I'm not able
[00:20:37] to focus at home I fall asleep in the
[00:20:40] library I'm you know procrastinate too
[00:20:42] much but whatever other excuse there is
[00:20:44] they're looking for a reason why they
[00:20:47] cannot do it and so I ask the question
[00:20:49] are you really wanting help why are you
[00:20:52] just wanting validation for why it's
[00:20:55] hard for you
[00:21:01] and the light just turned off I need to
[00:21:03] check out my Airbnb in like five minutes
[00:21:06] I haven't packed yet
[00:21:08] that's pretty good segue I'll leave you
[00:21:10] with that thought I'll catch you next
[00:21:11] time

=== What would someone smarter than you do? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewzgaWBF_E

[00:00:00] there used to be these really popular
[00:00:01] bracelets they used to say
[00:00:03] wwjd and it stood for what would Jesus
[00:00:06] do it was a way for people to think like
[00:00:08] oh what would the characteristics and
[00:00:11] attributes of in this case Jesus
[00:00:13] B in my situation and I think this is a
[00:00:16] really good reframing technique because
[00:00:18] it's very difficult for us to think
[00:00:20] about what we should do from our
[00:00:23] perspective and it can be easier to
[00:00:24] think what would someone else do that
[00:00:27] was able to achieve this we can think
[00:00:29] about what type of behaviors actions
[00:00:32] characteristics someone that could
[00:00:34] achieve at that level would do and then
[00:00:36] we can try to copy them and thinking
[00:00:38] about it in this way can help us study
[00:00:40] smarter rather than just harder


=== How to know if you're sleep deprived? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZiVlHNPmEA

[00:00:00] if you are chronically sleep deprived
[00:00:01] it's possible that you actually do not
[00:00:04] know what it's like to be well rested I
[00:00:06] legitimately didn't realize what being
[00:00:09] well rested felt like until I quit
[00:00:11] medicine and did like educational
[00:00:13] entrepreneurship full-time the feeling
[00:00:14] of just wanting to never wake up and the
[00:00:17] feeling like you need to take a nap
[00:00:18] every single day that's not actually
[00:00:20] normal it's not really healthy you're
[00:00:22] probably at some level sleep deprived
[00:00:24] the danger of chronic sleep deprivation
[00:00:26] is that you don't really know the impact
[00:00:28] that it's having on you until you
[00:00:30] compare it directly with being well
[00:00:31] rested I didn't know how inefficient I
[00:00:33] was being until I was well rested so
[00:00:35] have you fixed that sleep hygiene do
[00:00:37] everything you can to optimize your
[00:00:39] sleep hygiene for like three weeks and
[00:00:41] you'll see results


=== Do you ever get bored or tired of studying? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AF4kAC6DN4

[00:00:00] you know that feeling you get when
[00:00:01] you're reading something and you think I
[00:00:02] am not going to remember this you know
[00:00:04] you're going to have to go over it again
[00:00:05] and again and again you can feel the
[00:00:07] information slipping out of your brain
[00:00:08] who's felt that before your brain is
[00:00:10] telling you this is irrelevant it's
[00:00:12] isolated so instead of just saying oh
[00:00:14] well smashing into our notes to deal
[00:00:15] with later and staying in that lower
[00:00:17] order flick up into the higher order and
[00:00:19] make it relevant so try this start a
[00:00:22] tally when you study and count how often
[00:00:24] you get this feeling some of you will
[00:00:25] realize this is the only feeling you
[00:00:27] have when you study the goal is to
[00:00:29] reduce this number by about 10 every
[00:00:31] time you study how step two group
[00:00:33] information together


=== The Right Way to do a Dopamine Detox ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTSW93wYq7I

[00:00:00] dopamine detox is not about removing
[00:00:02] dopamine from your system it's not about
[00:00:04] doing things you hate it's about
[00:00:06] connecting with that slower more natural
[00:00:08] pace of dopamine release that you'd find
[00:00:10] in a
[00:00:12] non-artificially dopamine-heading world
[00:00:15] that we live in today there's a lot of
[00:00:16] different ways that you can do it just
[00:00:17] turning off your phone so that you're
[00:00:19] not going to be inclined to pick it up
[00:00:21] again putting it somewhere like sliding
[00:00:23] it under your bed or really just
[00:00:25] removing it out of sight and then
[00:00:26] putting yourself physically in an
[00:00:28] environment that is free from all of
[00:00:30] those dopamine hit type of things and
[00:00:32] then connect with something away from
[00:00:35] those artificial dopamine hits that you
[00:00:37] enjoy


=== Is a second brain required for higher-order learning? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_WRzpGHvgU

[00:00:00] second brain system is not really very
[00:00:02] necessary for higher order learning and
[00:00:04] that's because the the fundamental
[00:00:05] principle behind higher order learning
[00:00:07] is in creating higher order knowledge
[00:00:09] structures so higher order learning as a
[00:00:11] process is about that deeply comparative
[00:00:13] evaluative thinking when you have those
[00:00:15] types of knowledge structures that you
[00:00:16] created using higher order learning it
[00:00:19] means that that knowledge stays in your
[00:00:20] head and you can retrieve and use it the
[00:00:22] purpose of a second brain is for the
[00:00:24] type of information that either doesn't
[00:00:26] inherit me or is very difficult to
[00:00:28] always very time consuming to fit into
[00:00:31] that higher order knowledge structure
[00:00:33] there are maybe a few use cases where
[00:00:35] that second brand could be a good
[00:00:37] supplement actually the biggest one is
[00:00:39] that it gives you a sense of security
[00:00:40] because you know that all the lower
[00:00:42] order stuff like the stuff you need to
[00:00:44] memorize the reference numbers the
[00:00:46] formulas drug doses all that stuff you
[00:00:49] could chuck it on your second brain that
[00:00:51] could be used as a reference


=== What is intelligence? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_1gtD3IPwk

[00:00:00] what even is intelligence I am good at
[00:00:03] learning it's my thing this is what I do
[00:00:05] it's my job like I dedicate my life to
[00:00:06] it right so this is not a humble brag
[00:00:08] like I've dedicated my life to it I'm
[00:00:10] allowed to be good at this one thing
[00:00:12] however it doesn't mean that I am an
[00:00:14] expert at literally everything most of
[00:00:16] the time when I'm in a room I'm not the
[00:00:18] best at anything other than just
[00:00:19] teaching learning skills so intelligence
[00:00:22] is really kind of this false label I
[00:00:24] mean like what does it really mean
[00:00:25] because people are not looking for
[00:00:27] intelligence what people want are the
[00:00:30] outcome they want the result


=== Study music is Overrated: Learning Expert Explains WHY ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VAwuzuyu3A

[00:00:00] hey everyone it's Dr Justin sung here
[00:00:01] I'm a former medical doctor and now
[00:00:03] full-time learning coach and consultant
[00:00:05] and this is another episode of overrated
[00:00:07] underrated where we're going to be
[00:00:08] taking a lot of different ideas and I'm
[00:00:09] going to be giving my take on them as
[00:00:11] briefly as possible so let's go
[00:00:17] okay reading nonfiction overrated or
[00:00:20] underrated reading nonfiction overall
[00:00:22] I'm gonna say is properly rated because
[00:00:26] it's useful but also it's not useful if
[00:00:30] you just like buy a non-fiction book you
[00:00:31] read it and then you assume that that
[00:00:33] knowledge is now yours you can use it
[00:00:34] you have integrated you've applied the
[00:00:35] skill like learning and then consuming
[00:00:37] knowledge actually not the same thing
[00:00:40] some people just buy books and consume
[00:00:42] it and then they're like oh yeah that's
[00:00:43] part of my life now but actually you
[00:00:45] look at the bookshelf it's like well how
[00:00:46] much of that are you actually applying
[00:00:47] in your life so in that case it could be
[00:00:49] overrated but a lot of people do not
[00:00:51] read very much so therefore that will be
[00:00:52] underrated so therefore we land in the
[00:00:54] middle at properly rated
[00:00:56] listen to music while studying I think
[00:00:58] is overrated for sure so the whole idea
[00:01:00] behind listening to music especially
[00:01:01] classical music is actually done through
[00:01:04] correlative studies like there used to
[00:01:05] be these studies that were done on like
[00:01:06] high achieving students and what they
[00:01:07] listen to and then they listen to more
[00:01:09] classical music I think specifically
[00:01:10] there's the more Beethoven or Mozart or
[00:01:12] something but that there's so much
[00:01:14] confounding in those studies that those
[00:01:15] Studies have now since essentially been
[00:01:16] discredited when you look at this purely
[00:01:18] the research around like list like the
[00:01:20] sensation of taking in something orally
[00:01:22] while you're listening there doesn't
[00:01:24] seem to be any benefit of actually
[00:01:25] listening to anything or rhythmic or
[00:01:27] even like binaural beats and things
[00:01:30] there's not really strong evidence for
[00:01:31] it for me personally and for what I
[00:01:33] recommend to my students I generally
[00:01:35] just recommend having White Noise if
[00:01:37] there's anything that requires deep
[00:01:38] cognitive Focus
[00:01:39] I haven't been convinced that listening
[00:01:41] to music is beneficial for that for
[00:01:44] doing things that don't require so much
[00:01:45] cognitive Focus then yes uh definitely
[00:01:47] something that's a little bit more
[00:01:48] creative something a little bit more
[00:01:49] relaxed something where you're just kind
[00:01:50] of like going along in your workflow
[00:01:52] that's fine I listen to Lo-Fi like crazy
[00:01:54] my Spotify my Spotify wrap up for the
[00:01:56] years always a slow by Lo-Fi Lo-Fi Lo-Fi
[00:01:58] okay so I listen to a lot but I don't
[00:02:01] when I need a really focus and
[00:02:02] concentrate
[00:02:05] chat chatgpt is extremely like The Buzz
[00:02:10] and it's still it's probably still
[00:02:12] slightly underrated
[00:02:14] um most people don't realize but right
[00:02:16] now I'm sort of months into working on a
[00:02:18] artificial intelligence email project
[00:02:20] um with some with some big names and
[00:02:22] I've been in this space and I've been
[00:02:24] learning about it and then
[00:02:24] coincidentally chat GPT got released
[00:02:27] like in the middle of me working through
[00:02:28] that so when I was looking through it I
[00:02:30] was looking through a lens of just an
[00:02:31] educator but also someone that had been
[00:02:33] kind of immersed in the AI email space
[00:02:35] for a little bit by that point and I
[00:02:38] think the way that chat GPT will be
[00:02:40] utilized and can be utilized are still
[00:02:42] being very very like you know most
[00:02:45] people are not using it to the extent
[00:02:47] that it could be used they're not
[00:02:48] getting the efficiency they could get
[00:02:49] most people probably don't have the base
[00:02:52] learning technique at a higher order to
[00:02:54] be able to use chappy T in the right way
[00:02:56] because there are certain inquiry
[00:02:58] approaches that could be really
[00:02:59] effective if used in the right way
[00:03:01] however most people don't have a system
[00:03:02] that would allow them to use that in the
[00:03:04] first place because it's too lower order
[00:03:06] based so for that reason it's going to
[00:03:07] be underrated
[00:03:09] Coach House
[00:03:11] [Music]
[00:03:13] I want to say Coach House overrated
[00:03:15] um and look this is going to be
[00:03:16] completely just purely anecdotal like
[00:03:18] this is not coming from me having like
[00:03:20] years of experience working with
[00:03:21] students and things like this is just
[00:03:23] like me thinking about it myself I
[00:03:25] believe I am able to have good focus and
[00:03:28] productivity and you know manage myself
[00:03:31] and things like that I do not need to
[00:03:33] take cold showers and just purely
[00:03:35] anecdotally
[00:03:37] some of the people around me that are
[00:03:38] into taking cold showers are not
[00:03:40] particularly very productive or focused
[00:03:42] so it makes me think maybe it's like the
[00:03:45] easy thing that you can set your mind to
[00:03:47] to do that kind of like you know can
[00:03:49] help trigger and springboard things for
[00:03:51] you but I feel like there are probably
[00:03:54] more high-yield things that you could
[00:03:55] work on that are maybe less obvious to
[00:03:59] understand as shower in cold water
[00:04:02] um so for that reason I'm gonna say it's
[00:04:04] a little overrated I think I think it's
[00:04:07] hyped a little bit more than it maybe
[00:04:09] needs to be
[00:04:11] Khan Academy
[00:04:14] Khan Academy is probably
[00:04:17] underrated Khan Academy does a lot in
[00:04:19] the equity for Education space so I
[00:04:21] think most people don't know this but
[00:04:23] um for you know I've been in the
[00:04:25] education industry for 10 years now and
[00:04:28] my first seven years were in the
[00:04:29] non-profit sector in fact I didn't even
[00:04:31] pay myself for the first four or five
[00:04:32] years four and a half years so I am very
[00:04:36] very like keenly aware of the issues of
[00:04:38] like equity in in education and Khan
[00:04:40] Academy was one of the first players on
[00:04:42] the scene that actually did that at a
[00:04:43] global scale like Khan Academy is like
[00:04:45] an OG in the in the edtech and education
[00:04:47] online learning space no one was doing
[00:04:49] it like Khan before Khan Academy well at
[00:04:52] least no one was doing it well so I
[00:04:54] think for the impact the Khan Academy
[00:04:55] made the road that it paved the equity
[00:04:58] for Education that it's done and a lot
[00:04:59] of the non-profit work that Khan Academy
[00:05:00] continues to do I'm going to say it's
[00:05:02] it's underrated I don't think it gets a
[00:05:03] prop set it deserves
[00:05:05] foreign
[00:05:07] extremely overrated unless you are doing
[00:05:10] a career that literally requires that
[00:05:13] degree so for example like medicine law
[00:05:15] accounting like uh you know Financial
[00:05:18] Services type thing like these these
[00:05:20] career Pathways that the entry point to
[00:05:22] it is having the degree outside of those
[00:05:24] I would say that University is I think
[00:05:26] it's very very overrated I know that
[00:05:28] there are some degrees that the
[00:05:29] workplace is changing faster than the
[00:05:31] curriculum is changing so it's like I
[00:05:33] mean the Gap is going to be widening and
[00:05:35] widening and widening so I remember you
[00:05:37] know one of the previous marketing
[00:05:38] interns that I hired on they eventually
[00:05:40] became my marketing manager they they
[00:05:42] did a marketing degree and they said
[00:05:43] that none of the stuff they learned in
[00:05:45] uni they were able to actually use at
[00:05:48] their work and everything they learned
[00:05:49] about marketing was just purely on the
[00:05:50] job and I looked at the curriculum and I
[00:05:53] could agree the stuff was so outdated so
[00:05:56] for example it was a marketing degree at
[00:05:57] the time this is like six seven years
[00:05:58] ago now at the time there was nothing
[00:06:00] about social media can you imagine doing
[00:06:02] a marketing degree with nothing about
[00:06:03] social media anyway overall I think
[00:06:06] universities are never going to be able
[00:06:07] to catch out fast enough and so for some
[00:06:09] some Industries I don't think it's
[00:06:12] necessary and I think a lot of employers
[00:06:14] are wising up to that to the point where
[00:06:16] you do not need to have the degree to
[00:06:18] have certain jobs when five ten years
[00:06:21] ago you used to so if you're looking at
[00:06:23] going into University because you want
[00:06:24] to go down a career pathway I'd
[00:06:25] recommend go and look at what the
[00:06:28] employment space is like see right now
[00:06:30] today do you actually need that degree
[00:06:32] or can you do a udemy course can you do
[00:06:35] a course there like can you do something
[00:06:36] else without without having the
[00:06:37] university part
[00:06:38] [Music]
[00:06:40] oh School teachers well School teachers
[00:06:43] are you know like an entire group like a
[00:06:46] massive group of people as they're not
[00:06:48] homogeneous I think I think that they're
[00:06:50] they are underrated because of the fact
[00:06:53] that most people will never really
[00:06:54] interface with education very deeply and
[00:06:56] so they don't really know what it's like
[00:06:57] behind the scenes and so they you know
[00:06:59] they they don't really understand the
[00:07:01] plight of a school teacher already and
[00:07:02] and what they have to kind of deal with
[00:07:03] you know but having said that if you've
[00:07:05] had a bad teacher is that bad teacher
[00:07:08] like underrated well I mean like no not
[00:07:10] not really I suppose but I think the
[00:07:12] issue is that it's very easy to become a
[00:07:14] bad teacher because the system is set up
[00:07:16] where being a good teacher is actually
[00:07:17] very hard it takes a lot of energy and a
[00:07:20] lot of effort so that's why they are
[00:07:22] they're rare
[00:07:24] um and so School teachers as a general
[00:07:26] category I'll say that it's they're
[00:07:28] underrated
[00:07:31] inquiry-based learning is
[00:07:35] in the present sense the way that is
[00:07:37] being used now and the way that it's
[00:07:39] being implemented in the real world by
[00:07:41] the vast majority of Institutions
[00:07:43] inquiry-based learning is heavily
[00:07:45] overrated because inquiry-based learning
[00:07:48] is first of all does not have great
[00:07:50] evidence for it when you when you look
[00:07:51] at the implementation there are a lot of
[00:07:52] variables that factor into it
[00:07:56] inquiry-based learning is actually one
[00:07:57] school of thought that this was in
[00:07:59] construct constructivist schools of
[00:08:01] education and learning whereas the
[00:08:04] opposite is called cognitivist and I
[00:08:06] think the best blend is the marriage of
[00:08:08] the two like inquiry-based learning
[00:08:10] misses a lot of the things that are very
[00:08:12] valuable in the cognitive of space and
[00:08:13] therefore you have these schools and
[00:08:15] people that are using inquiry-based
[00:08:17] learning and they're not getting any
[00:08:18] effect from it and then they're
[00:08:19] wondering why and it's because the
[00:08:21] missing ingredient might be something in
[00:08:22] the cognitive space and that's something
[00:08:24] that I'm very passionate about actually
[00:08:25] bringing the two together because I
[00:08:27] think they complement each other but
[00:08:28] that hasn't happened right now yet in
[00:08:30] the main space when I consult schools or
[00:08:32] organizations no one is really bringing
[00:08:33] them together and for that reason I'd
[00:08:35] say just inquiry based learning by
[00:08:36] itself the way it's implemented now very
[00:08:38] overrated
[00:08:40] regular exercise is very very underrated
[00:08:42] and it's underrated for more reason than
[00:08:44] people would think so the obvious
[00:08:45] reasons is like it keeps you healthy
[00:08:47] some less known reasons might be that it
[00:08:49] helps you to focus improves your
[00:08:50] efficiency and actually improves the
[00:08:51] studies that's shown that aerobic
[00:08:53] exercise increases your cognitive
[00:08:54] performance as well but the other thing
[00:08:56] is that there's something called
[00:08:57] adaptive thermogenesis which means that
[00:08:59] even for purely thinking about exercise
[00:09:01] as a tool to like lose weight or get fit
[00:09:04] some people will just say like well diet
[00:09:06] is the most important thing and diet is
[00:09:07] important but actually adaptive
[00:09:09] thermogenesis tells us that it's a
[00:09:10] losing game only thinking about diet
[00:09:12] because your body gets more efficient
[00:09:14] with less calories so it means that your
[00:09:17] metabolic rate will start going down and
[00:09:18] down and down so if you are on a diet
[00:09:20] you will you will get short-term benefit
[00:09:22] but then eventually your body will adapt
[00:09:24] to having low calories and so it won't
[00:09:25] be burning anymore because it's not
[00:09:26] spending as many calories to do the same
[00:09:28] type of cellular activities and so then
[00:09:30] over time you have to then eat less and
[00:09:32] less and less and less and less and so
[00:09:33] then you end up eating like very like
[00:09:35] very very little and then you don't even
[00:09:36] have any energy and now your quality of
[00:09:38] life is affected even more than it was
[00:09:39] before so for that reason as well I
[00:09:42] think regular exercise is underrated
[00:09:43] people learning
[00:09:45] YouTube for learning is this is probably
[00:09:48] this is probably an interesting view
[00:09:49] because I am like an educator on YouTube
[00:09:51] but I actually think YouTube for
[00:09:53] learning is actually overrated because
[00:09:55] it's actually very hard to teach
[00:09:58] something complex through YouTube I'm
[00:10:01] not talking about Concepts you can you
[00:10:03] can create a playlist of Concepts but
[00:10:05] it's very hard to teach skills on
[00:10:08] YouTube because a lot of skill
[00:10:10] development requires like pattern
[00:10:12] identification finding mistakes getting
[00:10:14] feedback like doing stuff offline with
[00:10:17] what you learned online and from a
[00:10:19] education at scale perspective that's
[00:10:23] really really hard to facilitate like
[00:10:24] it's hard to know whether people have
[00:10:26] got the right understanding and to track
[00:10:27] it and to encourage them to do various
[00:10:29] activities and get feedback on that
[00:10:30] through a platform like YouTube I think
[00:10:33] for declarative knowledge only where
[00:10:34] it's just purely about just learning
[00:10:36] some Concepts YouTube is good but I'm
[00:10:38] still saying I'm overrated because of
[00:10:39] the fact that everyone knows you can
[00:10:41] learn everything on YouTube like no
[00:10:42] one's out there not knowing that you can
[00:10:43] learn things on YouTube so people will
[00:10:45] know it but I think people overestimate
[00:10:48] how much you can learn there are certain
[00:10:51] skills that to learn on YouTube maybe
[00:10:54] only two to three percent of the
[00:10:56] population would actually really be able
[00:10:58] to learn it to to that level and that's
[00:11:00] the reason why if you want to learn you
[00:11:02] know Muay Thai or Jiu Jitsu or you want
[00:11:04] to learn to be a great violinist or a
[00:11:07] Pianist or something you're not just
[00:11:09] going on YouTube like the people that
[00:11:10] are able to do that and become a very
[00:11:12] good that thing are very very very few
[00:11:16] compared to the number of people that
[00:11:17] are doing it and often if you are
[00:11:19] someone that is like an instructor of
[00:11:20] these things you'll know that there are
[00:11:21] a lot of people that start learning on
[00:11:23] YouTube and they come to you and the
[00:11:24] technique is terrible and actually they
[00:11:25] now need to like unlearn a lot of those
[00:11:27] mistakes and relearn things so that can
[00:11:30] be quite problematic
[00:11:31] social media is super overrated I mean
[00:11:33] do I need to explain that it's just like
[00:11:35] it's really just bad for your brain you
[00:11:37] know honestly unless you're following me
[00:11:39] in that case that's underrated so that's
[00:11:40] it for this episode of overrated
[00:11:41] underrated if there's anything that I
[00:11:43] mentioned that you want me to dive into
[00:11:44] in more detail please leave a comment
[00:11:46] down below let me know what it is that
[00:11:48] you want me to dive into and also
[00:11:49] specify the question about what aspect
[00:11:53] of it you want me to dive into in the

[00:11:59] me to expand on people just said like
[00:12:01] the word expand on it and I was like
[00:12:03] what about it so that that was my fault
[00:12:05] this time be a little bit more specific

=== The Truth About Studying at Cafes ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ns6giD2QUw

[00:00:00] the main thing is not the fact that it's
[00:00:01] a cafe the main thing is that you came
[00:00:03] to a new environment that has tied to a
[00:00:07] certain intention it's not like saying
[00:00:08] if you are at a cafe there's something
[00:00:10] about the cafe environment that just
[00:00:12] magically makes you focus in going to a
[00:00:14] new location that specifically puts you
[00:00:16] in an environment where the reason you
[00:00:18] came to that environment was for another
[00:00:20] intention and where you're free from
[00:00:22] potential distractors for me and for a
[00:00:24] lot of other people when you go to a
[00:00:26] cafe there's nothing else to do because
[00:00:27] you can only eat so much food and drink
[00:00:28] so much coffee so if you're there with
[00:00:30] your stuff you set up and you're in an
[00:00:32] environment maybe you've got your
[00:00:33] headphones on there's less distractions
[00:00:35] and you're in an environment that's
[00:00:36] primed for your intention the very Act
[00:00:39] of literally moving around going
[00:00:41] somewhere else and just changing things
[00:00:42] up is enough to give you a mental break
[00:00:44] reset recalibrate and then refocus


=== I was called a liar. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKmdGe8Kr0g

[00:00:00] yes I've been able to perform very
[00:00:02] highly when I entered into Medical
[00:00:03] School my grades were like essentially
[00:00:04] perfect however for those of you that
[00:00:06] are familiar with my story I had to
[00:00:07] study a lot I studied all the time I was
[00:00:11] studying constantly and if you think
[00:00:13] about it if I was truly so smart I
[00:00:17] wouldn't have needed to do all of that
[00:00:20] to perform well the fact that I had to
[00:00:24] study so much like a lot of people will
[00:00:26] leave comments underneath some of the
[00:00:27] videos that I upload saying like that's
[00:00:28] stupid like you don't need to study that
[00:00:30] much to enter into medical school you
[00:00:31] don't need to like and you're right you
[00:00:33] don't need to study that much the only
[00:00:35] reason I had to was because I wasn't
[00:00:37] just naturally smart enough to do it
[00:00:40] like I had to make up for that was just
[00:00:42] working more and more and more and more
[00:00:43] and I was actually like the lucky one
[00:00:46] like I could at least overcompensate and
[00:00:48] get that result


=== Journaling is only effective if you do this... ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8urrGh3EfaI

[00:00:00] journaling is not in itself always going
[00:00:02] to be effective if what it does is that
[00:00:04] it reinforces a negative thought pattern
[00:00:06] or a negative spiral in order for
[00:00:08] adrenaline to be productive it needs to
[00:00:11] conclude with something that is putting
[00:00:13] you in a better State than where you
[00:00:15] started off with if you want to take
[00:00:16] that to the next level we can go deeper
[00:00:18] so how do I react what are some of the
[00:00:21] tendencies that I had what are some of
[00:00:22] the habits what are some of the
[00:00:23] approaches what parts was I in control
[00:00:25] of what parts were was I not in control
[00:00:27] of in reflection what can I think about
[00:00:30] that I maybe didn't have the chance to
[00:00:31] think about at the time common
[00:00:33] strategies that we can go deeper into
[00:00:34] something is thinking about what are the
[00:00:36] things that we didn't notice the first
[00:00:38] time around the reasons why something
[00:00:40] happened environmental aspects of it
[00:00:42] triggers to something or potential
[00:00:44] hypotheses on how we could avoid it or
[00:00:47] deal with it better next time


=== The harsh reality for most students ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V1ucCW90nE

[00:00:00] if you are using the techniques that
[00:00:03] other people are already using like
[00:00:05] you're doing your flash cards you're
[00:00:06] studying the hours and you're writing
[00:00:07] your notes and you are still not
[00:00:09] achieving at a certain level that you
[00:00:10] want to be achieving what does that mean
[00:00:12] like the only logical conclusion there
[00:00:14] if you think that's the best possible
[00:00:16] method is that you're just too dumb so
[00:00:19] you could either believe that or you
[00:00:21] could believe the alternative which is
[00:00:23] that maybe the methods aren't as good as
[00:00:26] you think they are maybe the people that
[00:00:28] are successful with those methods are
[00:00:30] able to be successful not because of
[00:00:32] those methods but they're able to be
[00:00:34] successful despite those methods


=== You're not dumb, your methods are ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjhPKfL90Y

[00:00:00] it's not like I'm a stupid person and
[00:00:02] therefore I can't achieve it's like I am
[00:00:04] capable of achieving I just don't have
[00:00:05] the right tool I'm just not familiar
[00:00:07] with the right process I think that's a
[00:00:10] much better way of thinking about the
[00:00:11] situation rather than assuming that the
[00:00:14] most common methods that everyone uses
[00:00:16] are the best which the research that
[00:00:18] itself says is not the case rather than
[00:00:20] thinking that that's the case and then
[00:00:22] and then you're just too dumb I think
[00:00:24] it's better to think that hey maybe it's
[00:00:25] just my methods just like how I'm now
[00:00:27] good at doing IQ tests not because I'm
[00:00:30] naturally so smart but because I just
[00:00:32] got really good at that test if you get
[00:00:34] good at thinking about math you become
[00:00:37] good at math it's kind of really a way
[00:00:39] of like fake it till you make it


=== What's more important than learning skills? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guev0Vl06BM

[00:00:00] the learning skills are often less
[00:00:02] relevant and less important than the
[00:00:04] learning enablers these are the things
[00:00:06] like the mindset and the perspectives
[00:00:08] the time management the task management
[00:00:09] the prioritization the growth mindset
[00:00:11] because without those someone that
[00:00:13] doesn't have good learning skills would
[00:00:15] never be able to develop better learning
[00:00:17] skills

=== There are no silver bullets in learning ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8AcQfUA9nE

[00:00:00] if everyone is doing the same thing that
[00:00:01] this one student said that I should do
[00:00:03] is everyone going to do as well as that
[00:00:05] one student the answer must be no but if
[00:00:08] you research and self-regulated learning
[00:00:09] you will see that even when you have two
[00:00:12] students that are doing the exact same
[00:00:14] thing what's going on in here could be
[00:00:16] different you're going to be trying to
[00:00:17] hit the Finish Line without even knowing
[00:00:19] where you are running towards but as
[00:00:21] long as you're running you just feel
[00:00:22] like oh yes running is what I need to do
[00:00:24] let's just keep running but that's not
[00:00:25] the point the point is not to just keep
[00:00:27] running the point is to get to the
[00:00:29] finish line


=== You need to start loving your mistakes ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0pomVqvqUE

[00:00:00] the primary outcome of Peak Performance
[00:00:02] is the ability to engage in and thrive
[00:00:04] in and work with your mistakes at a very
[00:00:06] fast frequency rather than the outcome
[00:00:08] it's the understanding that we all have
[00:00:10] as professionals that the outcome is a
[00:00:12] symptom of the process if we all know
[00:00:14] that but it's there's a sense of
[00:00:16] insecurity especially from a business's
[00:00:17] point of view to say okay so therefore
[00:00:19] we're actually going to use that as the
[00:00:21] primary metric for Success because you
[00:00:23] need the outcomes at the end of the day
[00:00:24] so you need to have in a way that belief
[00:00:26] that yes if we just triple down and
[00:00:28] process you know mistake finding
[00:00:30] Behavior the outcome will become better
[00:00:32] over time and it creates a really great
[00:00:34] culture as well


=== This is the easiest way to stand out ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOlh4mpxi0A

[00:00:00] it is not hard to stand out especially
[00:00:03] if you are a student try to be involved
[00:00:05] in some kind of project of some sort it
[00:00:09] doesn't really even matter what it is as
[00:00:11] long as it's not crazy whatever you
[00:00:13] really want to do you don't have to even
[00:00:15] be good at it the idea here is that you
[00:00:17] want to demonstrate that you are the
[00:00:19] type of person that is willing to engage
[00:00:22] a little bit more than the bare minimum
[00:00:24] for something that you are interested in
[00:00:26] and obviously there's going to be great
[00:00:28] you know skill development from from
[00:00:29] doing stuff like that as well


=== How to be a better leader? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCunATlbgUs

[00:00:00] what leaders can do is to be aware of
[00:00:03] when they are asking questions or
[00:00:04] demanding things of people that place
[00:00:06] the importance or the value of them in
[00:00:08] their role or even as a person sometimes
[00:00:10] based on the outcome that's being
[00:00:11] produced and this can go really really
[00:00:13] deep for example let's say that you have
[00:00:16] a a new graduate that you've just
[00:00:17] employed a new member of your team and
[00:00:19] you assign them a certain task most of
[00:00:21] the time the success of that task is
[00:00:23] based on the outcome of that task there
[00:00:26] isn't too much thought given in terms of
[00:00:28] what is the process that they're doing
[00:00:29] and if there is it's usually
[00:00:30] retrospective based on the task so if
[00:00:32] they failed the task then we look at the
[00:00:34] process and see well where did we go
[00:00:35] wrong and if they succeeded on the task
[00:00:37] well we don't need to care about the
[00:00:38] process because the task was completed
[00:00:40] successfully it sounds like our office
[00:00:42] there's a vast overwhelming majority so
[00:00:45] a better way to do it would be when
[00:00:46] we're setting a task the first step of
[00:00:49] the task should be to to map out what
[00:00:51] the process is and then to say okay
[00:00:52] you're new to this we don't expect you
[00:00:54] to be perfect

[00:00:17] tick tock study advice if you're new to
[00:00:19] this channel I am a learning coach
[00:00:21] learning researcher certified teacher
[00:00:23] and the head of learning that I can
[00:00:24] study and a former medical doctor over
[00:00:26] the last decade I have helped tens of
[00:00:28] thousands of Learners across the world
[00:00:29] learn more efficiently so here's my take
[00:00:31] on this advice and this part three I
[00:00:34] think has probably the most high value
[00:00:36] like generally good advice compared to
[00:00:40] the the first two parts so hope you
[00:00:42] enjoy here's the study method that I use
[00:00:44] in medical school to learn everything
[00:00:46] this four-step method will help you
[00:00:48] master any material no matter what
[00:00:49] subject you're learning or what level
[00:00:51] you're at step one I watched the lecture
[00:00:53] on 1.5 to 2x speed and take notes my
[00:00:56] goal of the first pass is simply to
[00:00:57] understand the material rather than
[00:00:59] memorize every single fact the lecture
[00:01:01] is needed just try to get a basic
[00:01:03] overview of okay here's a hack that I'm
[00:01:05] gonna use I'm gonna tell you about that
[00:01:07] just takes that to another level what
[00:01:09] they've said so far that actually sounds
[00:01:10] good right like the focus is being on
[00:01:12] The Superficial General broad base
[00:01:14] here's two more things that you can add
[00:01:16] if you've got multiple lectures that are
[00:01:17] talking about essentially the same
[00:01:18] concept and the same topic do all of
[00:01:20] them at once if you can because you'll
[00:01:22] find more relationships between them
[00:01:24] than if you were to just do a single
[00:01:25] lecture sometimes there's something that
[00:01:27] you look at and you're like it takes you
[00:01:28] 15 minutes to just get your head around
[00:01:29] that but then actually three lectures
[00:01:31] later if you had known that information
[00:01:33] it would have made this so much easier
[00:01:34] to understand
[00:01:35] learning like broadly and superficially
[00:01:38] at the beginning is always better than
[00:01:40] going narrow and deep anyway the the tip
[00:01:42] here download the lecture if you can put
[00:01:45] it into an AI to transcribe it into
[00:01:47] words and then just read it it's faster
[00:01:50] than doing 1.5 or double speed just try
[00:01:52] to get a basic overview of the
[00:01:54] information use the free Google Chrome
[00:01:56] extension video screen controller to
[00:01:58] watch electrics faster step two I review
[00:02:00] the PowerPoint lecture and the notes
[00:02:01] that I took and I used them to make
[00:02:03] flashcards on a free apps
[00:02:07] because team yourself the material is
[00:02:09] one of the best ways to learn rather
[00:02:10] than saying what is the mitochondria I
[00:02:13] say what specific function of the
[00:02:15] mitochondria is conducive to life okay
[00:02:17] so all right like there was a Redemption
[00:02:19] here I was like oh we just immediately
[00:02:21] dropped into isolated lower what a
[00:02:23] non-integrated you know space retrieval
[00:02:25] methods but actually the spin that he
[00:02:28] took on it is much much better and this
[00:02:30] is a way that most people aren't really
[00:02:32] using flashcards so what what he's done
[00:02:34] is that he's created integration he's
[00:02:36] created connection and relationships
[00:02:37] between the information so it's not just
[00:02:39] isolated Factory call it requires more
[00:02:41] what we call elaboration and that's
[00:02:43] going to be a lot better for your
[00:02:44] learning than just a simple simple
[00:02:46] isolated one so well done um whatever
[00:02:49] your name was something Nosh right knee
[00:02:51] I think I said that name wrong
[00:02:55] um but the other thing is that you
[00:02:57] should you should um sort of refresh
[00:02:59] your flashcard questions every now and
[00:03:01] again if you're going to use this
[00:03:02] technique and again I still think that
[00:03:04] going straight to flashcards is probably
[00:03:07] premature because you're gonna have so
[00:03:09] many and like you're gonna spend all
[00:03:10] your all of your time doing that but if
[00:03:12] you are really gonna do that then make
[00:03:14] sure you've refreshed the refresh the
[00:03:15] questions the issue is that you can get
[00:03:17] into like a a pattern of queued recall
[00:03:20] only and what that means is that you can
[00:03:22] have a certain question you memorize the
[00:03:24] answer to that single question and
[00:03:26] you're no longer actually testing on the
[00:03:28] relationships anymore so like a great
[00:03:30] way that you know if this has happened
[00:03:31] is that you read a question like this
[00:03:33] and at the first point you read that
[00:03:35] question you might think about it and be
[00:03:37] like hmm I wonder what it is and try to
[00:03:38] answer it and the second time you're
[00:03:39] like wait what were the relationships
[00:03:41] that I thought of there and then you
[00:03:42] answer it again but maybe like the
[00:03:43] fourth time that you answer it you're
[00:03:45] just reading this what specific function
[00:03:46] of the Mito and then you already
[00:03:48] remember what it is and you can answer
[00:03:50] it straight away and what that indicates
[00:03:51] is that it's now a pattern recognition
[00:03:53] thing you're no longer thinking about or
[00:03:55] testing yourself on the relationships so
[00:03:57] rather than doing the same thing it's
[00:03:58] better to change the question so modify
[00:04:01] that question now or add a new flash
[00:04:02] card and get rid of this one and swap it
[00:04:04] out so instead of what specific function
[00:04:06] of the mitochondria is conducive to life
[00:04:07] you could say if the mitochondria did
[00:04:10] not have this specific function how
[00:04:12] might the cell be uh disadvantaged so
[00:04:15] you can see it's like a similar kind of
[00:04:17] question but it's actually testing you
[00:04:19] in a different way so you should be
[00:04:21] always mindful of when you're entering
[00:04:22] into just that pure like trigger
[00:04:24] response pattern recognition because
[00:04:26] that's not really testing on higher
[00:04:28] order structures anymore
[00:04:29] boom creating energy step three I review
[00:04:32] The Flash okay well I mean that was
[00:04:36] the emotional roller coaster this one
[00:04:37] boom creating energy so that's like the
[00:04:39] worst way to answer this question this
[00:04:41] is something that I call importance
[00:04:42] checklisting which is when you have a
[00:04:44] question that makes you do integrated
[00:04:46] thinking but instead of doing the
[00:04:47] integrated thinking you answer it in a
[00:04:49] way that causes you to have a single
[00:04:51] isolated lower order response this is a
[00:04:54] great question to prompt you for more
[00:04:55] elaborative thinking and it is more time
[00:04:58] consuming which is the reason why having
[00:05:00] a high volume flash cards with high
[00:05:01] frequency repetition is not
[00:05:02] mathematically scale like scalable
[00:05:04] sustainable if you're learning lots of
[00:05:06] stuff
[00:05:07] um but if you did have a question like
[00:05:09] this boom creating energy is not a great
[00:05:11] way to to answer it you should elaborate
[00:05:13] a little bit more like but anyway
[00:05:16] I review the flash cards that I made
[00:05:18] this is probably my favorite step
[00:05:19] because it takes the least amount of
[00:05:21] time and it really drills in the
[00:05:22] information step four measuring the
[00:05:24] effectiveness of a strategy based on how
[00:05:27] long it takes is not a great way you
[00:05:30] should be measuring the effectiveness
[00:05:31] based on the type of knowledge that
[00:05:33] helps you create or retrieve and then
[00:05:36] the amount of time it takes to achieve
[00:05:38] that it can if something takes you a
[00:05:40] very short amount of time but it doesn't
[00:05:41] provide a great benefit then it's not
[00:05:43] going to be very effective when this guy
[00:05:45] says review your flashcards I'm sure
[00:05:47] he's doing something in his head that
[00:05:50] makes it more effective and that is
[00:05:52] probably the secret Source behind this
[00:05:54] which is a reason why he's able to use
[00:05:55] these techniques with success is what's
[00:05:58] happening cognitively
[00:05:59] ask a classmate to do an active learning
[00:06:02] session with me in which we ask each
[00:06:03] other practice questions this allows me
[00:06:05] to understand the information from their
[00:06:07] perspective as well and it allows me to
[00:06:08] fill in any gaps that I might have
[00:06:10] missed you can't miss this one because
[00:06:11] it's definitely one of the best steps
[00:06:12] for drilling in there and then but
[00:06:14] that's really good the last one is
[00:06:15] really really good you know it's it's
[00:06:17] got that social learning element it is
[00:06:19] exposing you to more perspective so
[00:06:20] that's a really good step the only
[00:06:22] downside is that you need friends this
[00:06:24] study method has significantly decreased
[00:06:26] my study time and made me way more
[00:06:28] efficient try it out and let me know
[00:06:29] what you think follow me drop a like and
[00:06:31] send this video to a friend who studies
[00:06:33] a lot
[00:06:34] it is a revision technique that I use to
[00:06:36] get Ole stars at GCSE and a level and in
[00:06:38] two years worth of content can almost
[00:06:40] feel impossible so it's really important
[00:06:42] that you have an effective technique to
[00:06:43] condense the course down I did this
[00:06:45] using summary Pages where I'd make a
[00:06:47] single April page for a topic like the
[00:06:49] alkanes and we've forced myself to find
[00:06:51] a way to break everything down so the
[00:06:52] whole course material fit onto that one
[00:06:54] page I have loads more revision
[00:06:55] techniques so we'll make more videos so
[00:06:57] follow that
[00:06:58] cool so I think the main thing with this
[00:07:01] is like as I've said you know summary
[00:07:03] summary Pages work because it forces
[00:07:06] that prioritization evaluation of
[00:07:07] information if you use non-linear
[00:07:09] methods of summarization you're going to
[00:07:10] find that it's more challenging but much
[00:07:12] more effective as well so you know
[00:07:14] that's the additional thing that I add
[00:07:15] to that but I think I've already talked
[00:07:16] about summary Pages a lot
[00:07:18] um through this like set of videos the
[00:07:21] best revision method for lazy students
[00:07:23] crosswords they're so underrated that
[00:07:25] they've gotten through gcses a levels
[00:07:27] and med school there are children that
[00:07:30] let you study entire courses and dance
[00:07:31] here's some examples in container the
[00:07:34] restrooms
[00:07:36] you know what
[00:07:38] I don't know if I'm out of touch
[00:07:41] but I have never seen crossword studying
[00:07:45] like this this type of thing I I have a
[00:07:47] lot of opinions about the fact that it's
[00:07:49] still you know it's essentially just the
[00:07:50] same thing as flashcards right and so
[00:07:51] there's the limitations with isolated
[00:07:53] information and recall and it's not
[00:07:54] really testing your conceptual
[00:07:55] difficulty and networks are integrated
[00:07:57] thoughts so you're not really going to
[00:07:58] get any of the benefits of deep
[00:07:59] processing really unless of course
[00:08:01] you're already a deep processor but if
[00:08:03] you get curveball questions or higher
[00:08:04] level questions you're kind of screwed
[00:08:05] if you only rely on this technique and
[00:08:07] you don't have good deprocessing okay
[00:08:08] that's the Spiel done but this is just
[00:08:10] cool I like this just because it seems
[00:08:13] fun I want to do one this is cool I've
[00:08:15] never seen this before maybe I'm just
[00:08:17] maybe I'm out of touch now
[00:08:21] uh don't tell me this is the
[00:08:24] ah I hate this
[00:08:29] um
[00:08:30] we don't even start so from a research
[00:08:32] perspective there was research that says
[00:08:34] that you know something like the dueling
[00:08:36] method can work because of the fact that
[00:08:37] there is actually like a you know I
[00:08:39] can't remember what you might call it
[00:08:40] like a neuronal Arc I almost you know I
[00:08:42] imagine but there is something with you
[00:08:44] know active literally just moving your
[00:08:46] hands and just doing things and reading
[00:08:47] that allows you to have better
[00:08:50] comprehension of the information the
[00:08:51] main issue with this is that it is
[00:08:53] extremely extremely deep processing
[00:08:56] dependent which means that if you don't
[00:08:59] have really high and good levels of deep
[00:09:01] processing to begin with you will really
[00:09:03] struggle to improve by uh any any like
[00:09:07] real meaningful amount by using this
[00:09:09] method so again if you're struggling
[00:09:10] like you're actually struggling or
[00:09:13] you're just you know you're average and
[00:09:14] you just want to be like and that higher
[00:09:16] tier this is not really the thing that's
[00:09:17] going to change things very much but if
[00:09:19] you're if you're like kind of doing well
[00:09:21] and you just want to like increase the
[00:09:22] engagement when you're specifically
[00:09:24] reading something then this method can
[00:09:26] help you a little bit there's probably
[00:09:27] something like a you know five to ten
[00:09:30] percent benefit in terms of focus and
[00:09:32] comprehension at the point of reading
[00:09:33] but the word comprehension is like it's
[00:09:36] complicated like how do you even measure
[00:09:37] comprehension it's not just you know
[00:09:38] it's not just that you remembered
[00:09:40] something it's about how you can then
[00:09:41] use that information and then how many
[00:09:43] different ways this is not really going
[00:09:44] to help you with that
[00:09:48] I'm looking forward to that the best way
[00:09:51] to learn anything in just three steps
[00:09:53] first is you choose your topic and start
[00:09:56] studying I hate when people say the best
[00:09:58] way to do something you know or an
[00:10:01] imagine like how do you know that
[00:10:02] although teaching it to people is a lot
[00:10:04] like where do you get that confidence
[00:10:06] from better this exercise is definitely
[00:10:09] where you will discover the gaps in your
[00:10:11] knowledge and basically the aim of this
[00:10:13] whole technique is to help you identify
[00:10:15] your weaknesses in a topic and work on
[00:10:17] them harder and turn them into a
[00:10:19] strength
[00:10:21] yeah cool well I mean that's a fireman
[00:10:23] method
[00:10:24] is that Fame no I'm sure it's fine man
[00:10:27] anyway the Feynman method is
[00:10:29] um is a good method I think it's
[00:10:31] probably for uh for like a beginner
[00:10:33] that's just trying to get into effective
[00:10:35] learning strategies it's like one of the
[00:10:36] best techniques that you can use to just
[00:10:38] start getting in there there's a lot of
[00:10:40] great generative effects there's a lot
[00:10:42] of great active recall Active Learning
[00:10:43] retrieval uh benefits from it it's
[00:10:46] forcing some higher order integrated
[00:10:47] information there is a little bit of
[00:10:49] nuance there that it it still really
[00:10:52] depends on your ability to do the Deep
[00:10:54] processing so even though it encourages
[00:10:55] it the defining method doesn't have a
[00:10:57] lot of detailed instruction on how to do
[00:10:58] it especially the teaching step because
[00:11:00] the way you teach something also changes
[00:11:03] the way you think about it so there are
[00:11:05] methods of teaching that force you to
[00:11:07] evaluate it to a deeper level and so
[00:11:09] it's a lot more effective whereas if you
[00:11:10] were to teach something but the way
[00:11:12] you're teaching it is very just like you
[00:11:13] know almost like reading off the
[00:11:14] PowerPoint Style just like very linear
[00:11:16] like here are the facts that's not very
[00:11:18] effective because then you're only
[00:11:20] testing yourself at the lower orders so
[00:11:22] you know there's a lot of variation
[00:11:23] there but for a bit beginner technique
[00:11:25] find my method is is great to start with
[00:11:28] you know if I'm working with someone
[00:11:29] that's got some experience with this I
[00:11:30] know that there's going to be a
[00:11:31] foundation that's a lot easier to work
[00:11:33] with here are the three things I did to
[00:11:35] get a 99.99
[00:11:37] oh and you missed the point ask your
[00:11:40] teachers for extra material like
[00:11:41] challenging practice exam questions
[00:11:45] or application questions so that you're
[00:11:47] not cramming for the end of the video
[00:11:50] okay pretty simple points there don't do
[00:11:52] all the homework necessarily though I
[00:11:54] think she probably benefited from going
[00:11:56] to a school that gave more meaningful
[00:11:58] homework but there are honestly a lot of
[00:12:01] and like look I don't mean this in a way
[00:12:02] that's like Consulting to teachers or
[00:12:03] anything and sometimes it's just it's
[00:12:05] just how things are but sometimes
[00:12:07] homework is just not very useful you
[00:12:10] know there are really great guidelines
[00:12:12] that are especially not evidence-based
[00:12:14] ones on how to set homework that is
[00:12:16] Meaningful that produces good learning a
[00:12:19] lot of it is just kind of like
[00:12:20] the teacher has an idea about something
[00:12:23] and just gives it a go but actually a
[00:12:26] lot of homework is not going to help you
[00:12:28] if you are not studying okay if you're
[00:12:30] not studying in your personal time do
[00:12:32] your homework it's going to help you but
[00:12:33] if it's taking time away from something
[00:12:35] else that you want to be doing that is
[00:12:38] more productive for your studying you've
[00:12:39] got another method that you want to use
[00:12:41] then it depends on the method and
[00:12:43] depends on the homework but usually I
[00:12:45] find that homework then is kind of a
[00:12:47] distractor more so and I wish we had an
[00:12:50] education system that made it easier for
[00:12:52] teachers to just like let students do a
[00:12:55] little bit more of their own thing and
[00:12:56] take a little bit more control of their
[00:12:57] own and ownership over their learning
[00:12:59] rather than like prescribing homework
[00:13:01] but at the same time as someone that
[00:13:03] works with thousands of students like I
[00:13:05] know how hard it is to do that and I
[00:13:07] can't imagine trying to do that in like
[00:13:08] a school setting unless you're in like a
[00:13:10] private school where there's a lot more
[00:13:11] resources and a lot more support
[00:13:13] um but a lot of time homework is not
[00:13:15] really going to help you and actually
[00:13:16] one of the best things that you can do
[00:13:17] for yourself is learn a more effective
[00:13:19] method of self-study and just do your
[00:13:20] homework as fast as you can just so that
[00:13:22] the teacher like checks the box or
[00:13:24] something or negotiate with your teacher
[00:13:25] if they seem like an open-minded person
[00:13:27] be like hey I really want to self-study
[00:13:28] using this method I think it's going to
[00:13:30] be really effective for me is it okay
[00:13:31] for just like the next couple weeks I
[00:13:33] try using this method and then I I talk
[00:13:36] to you about how I'm finding it because
[00:13:37] I feel like it might be more useful for
[00:13:39] me than doing the homework well you know
[00:13:41] if they seem like an open-minded person
[00:13:43] maybe try to give that a go but you know
[00:13:45] that's going to be up to you right I
[00:13:46] don't think any responsibility for you
[00:13:48] know you getting in trouble with your
[00:13:51] teacher if they're like a super super
[00:13:52] conservative like you know like how dare
[00:13:54] you define me kind of personality
[00:13:57] um
[00:13:58] yeah the the next thing asking for a
[00:14:00] more more challenging material this is
[00:14:02] actually good like you I I think every
[00:14:05] student should always hold themselves to
[00:14:06] a higher standard in general it just
[00:14:08] pushes you forward a little bit more and
[00:14:10] learning outside the scope is better for
[00:14:12] your learning overall anyway uh and
[00:14:14] revising on a regular basis this is good
[00:14:16] advice too uh so overall I think there's
[00:14:19] just maybe a little bit of nuance that
[00:14:21] this person is missing based on the fact
[00:14:22] that she probably doesn't have
[00:14:23] experience working with lots of schools
[00:14:25] and students of diverse backgrounds but
[00:14:28] given that it's just coming from her her
[00:14:29] experience and she did say like this is
[00:14:32] how she did it I think it's yeah like
[00:14:34] good advice revising for anything can be
[00:14:37] incredibly stressful so it's my top tips
[00:14:40] to make revision that little bit easier
[00:14:41] and to alleviate some of those choices
[00:14:43] so when I was revising I would always
[00:14:45] get my things from environment so
[00:14:47] definitely go and check those out for
[00:14:48] all of your revision needs my first tip
[00:14:50] is to get some random in so you can map
[00:14:52] out when you're going to do revision
[00:14:54] when you're going to take rest days
[00:14:55] because that's really important when
[00:14:57] you're gonna do mock exams all of those
[00:14:58] things that's good my second tip is to
[00:15:00] get a clock that's just on the table
[00:15:02] it's not your phone so you don't get
[00:15:03] distracted
[00:15:04] your revision time and figure out what's
[00:15:07] next
[00:15:09] what he said next tip get yourself an
[00:15:12] exercise book one that you can divide
[00:15:14] into sections is so useful just for all
[00:15:16] of your original notes but whilst
[00:15:18] revising make it colorful make it but
[00:15:19] you know so so again this is only if
[00:15:21] you're using a linear note-taking style
[00:15:22] but once you start getting into higher
[00:15:24] order learning and that becomes the
[00:15:25] method through which you think like once
[00:15:27] you start understanding the value of
[00:15:29] integrated thinking you will find that
[00:15:31] A4 size paper is just so restrictive and
[00:15:34] it's hard to use so again I I always say
[00:15:36] and I understand not everyone can afford
[00:15:37] it but if you can try to save up to get
[00:15:39] yourself a tablet even if it's like the
[00:15:41] cheapest possible you know like Android
[00:15:42] tablet out there with a tablet with a
[00:15:44] Pen stylus Infinite Canvas is like is a
[00:15:47] game changer for for learning if you are
[00:15:50] using integrative thinking and
[00:15:52] non-linear note taking which really is
[00:15:55] just vastly Superior so useful just for
[00:15:58] all of your audition notes whilst
[00:16:00] revising make it colorful make it stand
[00:16:01] out it's going to help you remember it
[00:16:03] uh I mean the research on that is it
[00:16:05] doesn't really work quite that way but
[00:16:13] stick them everywhere short notes to
[00:16:16] help you remember
[00:16:18] so the final thing that that's not
[00:16:20] really going to be very effective for
[00:16:22] most people unless you've got a very few
[00:16:24] number of things that you're trying to
[00:16:25] remind yourself for if the information
[00:16:27] is very very simple but if you like it's
[00:16:29] quite a niche situation where you'd need
[00:16:31] that if you do really have detailed
[00:16:34] isolated fact related information that
[00:16:36] you're trying to remember you should
[00:16:37] really be using a digital flashcard app
[00:16:39] for those that type of information like
[00:16:40] Anki I actually used to do that though I
[00:16:43] actually used to have stuff like just on
[00:16:44] my mirror so like when I'm brushing my
[00:16:46] teeth and you know I can remember it and
[00:16:48] all I remember is I had the notes up I
[00:16:50] don't remember anything that was on them
[00:16:51] when it comes to revising like properly
[00:16:53] this is something I'm so passionate
[00:16:54] about so I don't care what Tick Tock
[00:16:56] again I hate the best title here it's
[00:16:58] like what how how do you know that why
[00:17:01] are you why are you so confident about
[00:17:02] that what YouTube video what like genius
[00:17:05] that you know that has told you like
[00:17:07] this is the perfect method to revive and
[00:17:09] smash your exam like genuinely there is
[00:17:11] no perfect method that's like
[00:17:15] oh wait so this she's responding to
[00:17:17] someone that is asking what is the best
[00:17:19] technique oh all right I get it sorry my
[00:17:22] bad Christina when it comes to revising
[00:17:24] like properly this is something I'm so
[00:17:26] passionate about so I don't care what
[00:17:27] Tick Tock what YouTube video what like
[00:17:29] genius that you know that has told you
[00:17:32] like this is the perfect method to
[00:17:33] revise and smash your exam like
[00:17:35] genuinely there is no perfect method one
[00:17:38] of the best methods is genuinely to use
[00:17:40] all the methods as in do some flashcards
[00:17:43] make a few posters do some past papers
[00:17:45] do blurting on a whiteboard and fill in
[00:17:47] the bits that you don't know like use
[00:17:48] everything because all methods have
[00:17:50] flaws past papers are great but they're
[00:17:52] not going to cover every single topic
[00:17:54] ever flashcards are great but they do
[00:17:55] get boring after a while the posters are
[00:17:58] great but it does take forever to make a
[00:17:59] poster on the topic each supervision
[00:18:01] technique has their strengths and
[00:18:02] weaknesses so if you can use all of them
[00:18:03] you're going to be covering all bases
[00:18:06] yeah like that's great that's great
[00:18:09] advice I don't have a lot to say about
[00:18:10] that I would say don't use all revision
[00:18:12] methods I know especially in some
[00:18:15] countries there are revision methods
[00:18:17] that are like straight up will not work
[00:18:19] especially in Asia there are some very
[00:18:21] desperate students trying to do stuff uh
[00:18:24] and so like I wouldn't say do everything
[00:18:27] I would say think about the benefit cost
[00:18:30] and benefit of the technique if you know
[00:18:32] the cost and benefit like of a technique
[00:18:34] then you should be able to mix and match
[00:18:35] them and then bring them together into
[00:18:37] your system and make it make a decision
[00:18:38] about that right but I would say think
[00:18:40] about it and then use it and I think
[00:18:42] that's something that was like implicit
[00:18:44] in what she was saying I'm sure she's
[00:18:45] not saying like do all the real crazy
[00:18:47] things but the essence of the message is
[00:18:49] there and I agree with it and so that's
[00:18:51] great advice good advice Christina and
[00:18:54] that's it that that's it we are at the
[00:18:56] end of all the videos if there are
[00:18:58] specific things that you want me to
[00:19:00] review uh let me know but otherwise
[00:19:02] thanks for watching if there's things
[00:19:04] that you want me to go into a little bit
[00:19:05] more depth let me know know in the
[00:19:07] comments and I'll try to make a bigger
[00:19:08] video explaining some of that a little
[00:19:09] bit more if you like these kind of
[00:19:10] reaction videos let me know as well but
[00:19:12] thanks for watching we'll see in the
[00:19:13] next one

=== What is focused meditation? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCq3Rsqsmog

[00:00:00] Focus meditation
[00:00:02] well focused meditation is really a I
[00:00:05] think personally I I think it could be
[00:00:06] viewed as really a subset of mindfulness
[00:00:08] meditation in fact all these meditative
[00:00:10] practices kind of end up sort of
[00:00:12] blending together the only difference is
[00:00:14] the intention behind it and also there
[00:00:16] isn't really clear research that
[00:00:17] differentiates the benefits of different
[00:00:19] forms of meditation from each other so
[00:00:22] if you look at something like
[00:00:24] um like very secular meditation
[00:00:26] practices versus something that's more
[00:00:27] like religious or Transcendental
[00:00:28] Meditation you're not really seeing that
[00:00:30] there are unique differences for each of
[00:00:33] these at least not when you look at the
[00:00:34] research as a whole
[00:00:36] so I think meditation as a as a whole is
[00:00:39] just good to do and if you're wanting to
[00:00:41] use it for Focus whether you wanted to
[00:00:42] use it to calm down whether you want to
[00:00:44] use it to detach or just you know deal
[00:00:46] with anxiety or whatever it is I think
[00:00:48] that's just up to you to pick your
[00:00:49] intention but it's just good overall


=== How to draw and doodle for visual processing? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1wyrLLe3u8

[00:00:00] drawing or doodling drawing or doodling
[00:00:03] is overall
[00:00:05] underrated but most people aren't really
[00:00:09] doodling in a way that is productive
[00:00:11] like most people are doodling like
[00:00:12] making the you know organic chemistry
[00:00:15] it's like oh yeah history like they're
[00:00:17] drawing out you know making it really
[00:00:19] pretty but drawing and doodling is a
[00:00:20] great way of representing information
[00:00:21] non-verbally which is important because
[00:00:23] your visual processing has tens of
[00:00:25] thousands of times faster than your
[00:00:26] written word processing but also because
[00:00:28] of the fact that it allows you to
[00:00:29] express more information in a way that
[00:00:31] is non-directional which is the way that
[00:00:33] knowledge is inherently sort of
[00:00:35] non-linear and omnidirectional so trying
[00:00:37] to represent it linearly means that you
[00:00:38] lock yourself into learning it in a
[00:00:40] linear flow whereas drawings and doodles
[00:00:42] can actually break that open you can
[00:00:43] look at like an image all at once in one
[00:00:45] go and take in lots of information all
[00:00:47] in one go and that is a very underrated
[00:00:49] part of of learning


=== Does your boss tell you this? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVdI7UHWu6Q

[00:00:00] there's a big issue in the corporate
[00:00:01] space I think when people say growth
[00:00:03] mindset growth Minds that have more of
[00:00:04] it have more of it without recognizing
[00:00:05] what are the constituents behind it and
[00:00:07] that can actually make things worse
[00:00:08] because now you have all these people
[00:00:09] that know what growth mindset is
[00:00:11] recognize they don't have it but they're
[00:00:13] not given the skills to realistically
[00:00:15] develop them so now they feel even worse
[00:00:17] because now they know that there's a big
[00:00:18] disparity between what they should be
[00:00:20] and then where they are and there seems
[00:00:22] to be no way to bridge that Gap and I
[00:00:23] think that's probably doing more harm
[00:00:24] than good


=== How to develop a growth mindset? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEukCCgsgc

[00:00:00] growth mindset versus fixed mindset
[00:00:01] these uh in a way almost personality
[00:00:03] attributes that have been developed
[00:00:04] since usually a young age and one of the
[00:00:07] characteristic differences is the
[00:00:09] response that someone has to making
[00:00:11] mistakes and to difficulty so someone
[00:00:13] with a fixed mindset is seeking
[00:00:15] validation because they are obsessed
[00:00:18] about an outcome their primary focus is
[00:00:19] to have a positive outcome whereas
[00:00:21] someone with a growth mindset the
[00:00:22] outcome is a side effect of the process
[00:00:24] and their focus on the process making
[00:00:26] mistakes is something that they are
[00:00:27] thriving in they're actually looking for
[00:00:29] those mistakes because they see them as
[00:00:30] growth opportunities whereas with a
[00:00:32] fixed mindset the mistake actually
[00:00:34] starts to create insecurity it
[00:00:36] challenges their sense of identity and
[00:00:38] in some cases their sense of self-worth
[00:00:40] so those with a growth mindset because
[00:00:42] they aren't having like an existential
[00:00:44] crisis every single time they make a
[00:00:45] mistake they're able to throw themselves
[00:00:47] in the deep end and learn a lot more
[00:00:49] effectively


=== Are daily affirmations too trendy? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqsoxjc_mfM

[00:00:00] daily affirmations uh
[00:00:02] uh daily affirmations it's quite a trend
[00:00:05] these days it's quite trendy these days
[00:00:07] so for that reason I'd say it's I'm
[00:00:09] gonna say it's properly rated I think I
[00:00:11] think it was underrated and I think it's
[00:00:13] right now it's properly rated because
[00:00:14] it's it's becoming more popular and
[00:00:15] people are starting to understand that
[00:00:16] it's great for positive reinforcement
[00:00:18] and building that positive psychology
[00:00:21] um and helping to sort of break out of
[00:00:23] learn helplessness behaviors maybe if
[00:00:25] you asked me a year from now I might say
[00:00:27] it's overrated because there are
[00:00:28] branches of daily affirmation to sign a
[00:00:30] branch out into this kind of like
[00:00:31] mystical hippie like woo like I'm gonna
[00:00:33] do my daily affirmation as I I look and
[00:00:36] rub into my magical crystal ball and
[00:00:37] like rub salt all over my hair like it's
[00:00:39] starting to Branch into this weird
[00:00:41] territory that's a little off so
[00:00:43] especially on Tick Tock it's it's very
[00:00:46] like you know kills my faith in humanity
[00:00:48] so uh at the moment I'm gonna say
[00:00:50] properly rated but maybe in the future
[00:00:52] it's going to become overrated


=== What type of daily reflection is useful? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFDlJDzFnpE

[00:00:00] is Daily Reflection overrated underrated
[00:00:02] Daily Reflection I think is underrated
[00:00:05] because not many people do it just to
[00:00:08] note that just because you are doing
[00:00:09] Daily Reflection doesn't mean that
[00:00:10] you're getting on the value of daily
[00:00:12] reflection and in some cases Daily
[00:00:13] Reflection can actually make things
[00:00:14] worse especially if you're using that as
[00:00:16] like a a trigger point for negative
[00:00:18] spiraling so I think proper reflective
[00:00:21] technique is super super super
[00:00:22] underrated and if you have proper
[00:00:24] reflective technique and daily
[00:00:26] journaling I think that can be a very
[00:00:27] powerful combination


=== The enemy of a great life is a good life ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg4qOG9iw7c

[00:00:00] there's this thing called the region
[00:00:01] beta Paradox where if things are like
[00:00:03] kind of bad but not like terribly bad
[00:00:05] it's actually the worst place to be
[00:00:07] because it's not good but it's also not
[00:00:09] so bad that you're not like changing
[00:00:11] things I don't know maybe maybe the
[00:00:13] despair you feel now makes you feel so
[00:00:16] much worse that it catalyzes you to make
[00:00:18] a change I don't know maybe
[00:00:20] um burnout though is a really tricky
[00:00:21] thing though it's a really tricky thing


=== How CEOs Need to Learn ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF9rwQxsD1w

[00:00:00] what I wanted to do today in the session
[00:00:01] was very interactive my objective is to
[00:00:04] optimize whatever learning processes
[00:00:07] that any of you have based on your needs
[00:00:10] and it's a fully transferable skill so
[00:00:12] even if you're learning different things
[00:00:13] or learning it in a different setting at
[00:00:15] the end of the day all of that external
[00:00:17] stuff is going to come into your brain
[00:00:18] it's just going to be data in and as
[00:00:20] soon as data comes into your brain
[00:00:22] everything homogenizes it's basically
[00:00:23] the same stuff that happens and so the
[00:00:26] structure that I want to take is first
[00:00:27] of all identifying what type of learning
[00:00:29] scenarios and needs do you have and then
[00:00:32] mapping that against what would you love
[00:00:34] learning to be like so for example maybe
[00:00:36] you don't say you've got a problem with
[00:00:38] learning per se but maybe you would love
[00:00:40] if you could learn like this and then
[00:00:43] what we'll do is map out the existing
[00:00:45] sort of process that you're using and
[00:00:46] we've got limited time so in that time
[00:00:48] I'll just focus in on what I would think
[00:00:50] would be the highest impact thing that
[00:00:52] you could make a change in that would
[00:00:53] immediately improve your efficiency of
[00:00:55] learning and just a little bit of the
[00:00:57] theory around it so that when you leave
[00:00:59] here you've got some first principles to
[00:01:01] fall back on and start being the
[00:01:03] mechanic of your own brain I think a lot
[00:01:05] of the time when we're learning if
[00:01:07] there's a problem with the learning we
[00:01:09] have an overall way of tackling it per
[00:01:11] se because it's not very clear what part
[00:01:14] of it is producing the result there's so
[00:01:16] many things going on in the learning
[00:01:17] process all we have is this binary idea
[00:01:19] that sometimes it kind of works well and
[00:01:21] sometimes it doesn't work as well and
[00:01:22] then we can often have these ideas like
[00:01:24] I'm just not good at this type of
[00:01:25] thinking I'm just not good at this type
[00:01:27] of topical subject or you know I just
[00:01:29] struggle to think about that I can never
[00:01:30] remember this type of thing but actually
[00:01:32] those assumptions are most likely just a
[00:01:34] symptom of a method that was not
[00:01:35] correctly optimized and so the idea is
[00:01:37] not let's take you from
[00:01:39] like being absolutely terrible to being
[00:01:42] decent it's going from being already
[00:01:44] pretty decent to absolutely weaponizing
[00:01:46] what works for you and just eliminating
[00:01:48] every fraction of something that does
[00:01:49] not work and just removing friction so
[00:01:52] would you just underlying question here
[00:01:54] do you think that it's about optimizing
[00:01:55] for each person each person's got a
[00:01:57] different learning style or is there an
[00:01:58] ideal path the way that I like to
[00:02:00] explain this is with the example of a
[00:02:02] banana a banana is like I don't know
[00:02:04] like 50 genetically identical to like a
[00:02:06] human being all human beings have a
[00:02:08] brain that is 99.9999 pretty much the
[00:02:12] same the individual variation happens in
[00:02:14] the very very small fraction so there is
[00:02:16] individual variation that is important
[00:02:18] and optimizing that is important as well
[00:02:20] but in the overwhelming majority of
[00:02:23] cases the biggest high yield thing that
[00:02:25] can be improved is actually something
[00:02:27] that's fundamental that is basically the
[00:02:29] same for all people once the
[00:02:31] fundamentals are done then we start
[00:02:32] fine-tuning and that's where it gets a
[00:02:34] little bit more complex and a lot of
[00:02:35] that individualization the idea of
[00:02:37] people having different learning styles
[00:02:39] as not really something that is we're
[00:02:40] not really considered that scientific
[00:02:42] anymore it's been sort of disproven for
[00:02:44] for the last few decades but there is
[00:02:45] definitely learning preferences and that
[00:02:47] you know people tend to like learning in
[00:02:48] a certain way but those learning
[00:02:50] preferences are usually formed from
[00:02:51] prior experiences and what they feel
[00:02:53] comfortable and competent with but
[00:02:54] research is also quite strong in saying
[00:02:56] that if you develop competencies with
[00:02:57] other learning styles so your
[00:02:59] preferences are of a wider range
[00:03:03] yeah yeah so it basically just equips
[00:03:05] you with more weapons so for example a
[00:03:06] common thing would be I mean how many of
[00:03:08] you listened to like an audible or
[00:03:09] something or like a lot of people really
[00:03:10] struggle with what they do with that new
[00:03:13] information that comes in because a lot
[00:03:14] of that information they're thinking
[00:03:15] about and think oh this is very useful
[00:03:16] and then it's like well I'm driving like
[00:03:18] I can't like do I pull over or do I like
[00:03:19] quickly like draw something else I just
[00:03:21] try to like hold on to that or sometimes
[00:03:22] you can feel like oh I don't need to
[00:03:24] write this down like I'm going to
[00:03:25] remember this it's just you know it just
[00:03:26] clicks right and it just stays there but
[00:03:28] sometimes you think there's a chance
[00:03:30] that by the time I finish this this
[00:03:31] drive that particular point I just don't
[00:03:34] have it locked in at that level that I
[00:03:35] wanted to or sometimes especially how
[00:03:37] many of you read like multiple things
[00:03:39] simultaneously it's not just like
[00:03:40] necessarily one audiobook but it's like
[00:03:42] an audiobook and maybe got a book about
[00:03:43] that topic on the side or an article
[00:03:45] that you read that's you know related to
[00:03:46] that topic yeah it's pretty common I
[00:03:48] think so when we're doing that type of
[00:03:49] information consumption a very common
[00:03:51] thought is oh that like reminds me of
[00:03:53] this thing that I've read in this other
[00:03:54] book and it's like it's obviously
[00:03:56] related together and there's this kind
[00:03:57] of comparison but without the skill to
[00:04:00] take that and then fully consolidate
[00:04:02] that into your knowledge knowledge
[00:04:03] there's a lot of kind of efficiency
[00:04:04] that's lost there so the way that I like
[00:04:07] to say it is if you imagine that
[00:04:09] everything that you learned that you
[00:04:11] thought I should hold on to this you
[00:04:12] could just hold on to it and then what
[00:04:14] you held on to was at the level where it
[00:04:16] is fully integrated and connected so
[00:04:17] you're able to use that information
[00:04:18] fluidly and omnidirectionally not just
[00:04:21] like I hold on to it because I thought
[00:04:23] about it every 20 seconds for this drive
[00:04:24] that is sort of the ideal situation it's
[00:04:27] not necessarily always possible to get
[00:04:28] to that ideal situation but you can get
[00:04:30] pretty close does that answer your
[00:04:31] question in a very long way yeah
[00:04:34] yeah Okay cool so let's just start off
[00:04:36] with um identifying some of the learning
[00:04:37] tasks that you tend to engage in so it
[00:04:39] can really be anything it doesn't have
[00:04:40] to be like the biggest most important
[00:04:42] one but just something that's relevant
[00:04:43] for your life what are the things that
[00:04:44] you'd like to learn what are the things
[00:04:45] that you want to learn the learning
[00:04:47] challenges potentially if you know that
[00:04:49] there are barriers or things and just
[00:04:50] note a few of them down what about the
[00:04:52] other way around what
[00:04:58] how to teach better okay to apply
[00:05:01] um some of these methodologies uh to my
[00:05:04] students okay there is a overlap this
[00:05:06] shared ground and that if you really
[00:05:08] understand how knowledge works and how
[00:05:09] it interacts in the brain that
[00:05:11] fundamentally changes how you think you
[00:05:12] should present it I will talk about a
[00:05:15] few principles with regards to how you
[00:05:17] communicate information that is more
[00:05:19] likely to cognitively optimize it in
[00:05:22] someone else's brain without them doing
[00:05:24] the work so even if they are not
[00:05:26] optimized in their ability to take
[00:05:27] information in there are ways that you
[00:05:29] could present it that force them to
[00:05:31] think about it in a certain way that
[00:05:32] would sort of hijacked their own
[00:05:33] Pathways I'll talk about that a little
[00:05:34] bit it's a very deep topic though so I'm
[00:05:36] not going to cover it in depth but I'll
[00:05:37] definitely touch on it so the next part
[00:05:39] would be to start mapping out what the
[00:05:42] learning process kind of looks like so
[00:05:44] we're really diving into something that
[00:05:45] we call metacognition right now which is
[00:05:47] the thinking about thinking just like if
[00:05:49] you're sort of driving a car and the
[00:05:50] analogy that I give is that if I'm
[00:05:52] driving along and then I'm driving and I
[00:05:54] just think like something about the
[00:05:55] engine just does not sound right like it
[00:05:57] doesn't you know something doesn't it
[00:05:58] feels little bit off and I'm listening
[00:06:00] to it I'm thinking that's not how it
[00:06:02] should be is rattling a little bit
[00:06:03] there's a little bit of like I'm feeling
[00:06:04] a bit more vibration at the wheel I'm
[00:06:06] going to pull over I'm going to open up
[00:06:07] the hood I'm going to look inside and
[00:06:08] I'm going to think I actually don't know
[00:06:09] anything about cost so I'm just going to
[00:06:11] close the lid I'm going to ignore that
[00:06:12] and I'm just going to say this is just
[00:06:13] how my car drives now and I'll take it
[00:06:15] to a mechanic but if that mechanic is
[00:06:17] hard to come by then it's just you drive
[00:06:20] a car that rattles now and that just
[00:06:22] becomes how it is so becoming the
[00:06:24] mechanic of your own learning is
[00:06:25] something I think is very very important
[00:06:26] when you open the hood you know what
[00:06:28] you're looking at so let's start mapping
[00:06:30] out what the learning process is and try
[00:06:32] to be specific so we take it in terms of
[00:06:34] this
[00:06:35] information comes in
[00:06:38] okay that's going to interact with your
[00:06:39] brain
[00:06:43] and then as inside the brain things are
[00:06:45] going to happen
[00:06:47] and I want you to try to be specific
[00:06:49] about what is happening in your brain so
[00:06:51] it could be things that you are
[00:06:52] observing you notice you tend to think
[00:06:54] about certain things or it could be
[00:06:56] things that you are actively consciously
[00:06:58] trying to do when information comes in
[00:07:00] it'll be a combination of both and then
[00:07:02] information is going to be outputted and
[00:07:05] this is the term we use for this is that
[00:07:07] that information is going to be
[00:07:08] retrieved and we also want to think
[00:07:10] about the types of retrieval when I do
[00:07:12] this talk and I talk to students they
[00:07:14] have a lot of what we call lower order
[00:07:16] retrieval requirements which is just
[00:07:18] what is the definition what does the
[00:07:20] terminology mean all this sort of stuff
[00:07:21] for most of us in this room that level
[00:07:24] of retrieval is almost completely
[00:07:25] obsolete in our lives now you either
[00:07:27] just look it up or someone else's job to
[00:07:29] know what that means right and it's just
[00:07:31] not a good investment of time and that's
[00:07:32] not the learning that we really struggle
[00:07:34] with so when we're thinking about
[00:07:35] retrieval what we're also looking at is
[00:07:37] the order of retrieval and specifically
[00:07:39] we're looking at higher order of
[00:07:42] retrieval so a higher order of retrieval
[00:07:44] would mean that you're retrieving the
[00:07:46] information primarily this is the
[00:07:48] Hallmark of higher order retrieval is
[00:07:49] that that information is almost never
[00:07:50] retrieved in isolation that information
[00:07:52] is usually paired with something else
[00:07:53] there's a comparison there is a
[00:07:55] application there's a context so if you
[00:07:57] think about the way that you tend to use
[00:07:58] information that you learn the question
[00:08:00] that I'll put out is do you feel that
[00:08:02] the majority of that retrieval happens
[00:08:04] in a way that that information is never
[00:08:06] retrieved in isolation
[00:08:08] right we would agree with that there may
[00:08:10] be the odd exception to that would be
[00:08:12] what we call mid-order so what mid-order
[00:08:14] retrieval would be is the application of
[00:08:17] a singular isolated piece of information
[00:08:18] for a very specific circumstance so that
[00:08:21] is also what we would be considering as
[00:08:23] isolated information retrieval so that
[00:08:25] would be for example if there's a very
[00:08:26] very specific problem that you have to
[00:08:28] sow so you learn a very specific thing
[00:08:30] about that problem directly and then the
[00:08:32] way you retrieve it is purely within
[00:08:34] that context so that's the odd exception
[00:08:35] to it but again it's you know fairly
[00:08:37] rare so it's like higher order is going
[00:08:38] to be more like pattern recognition this
[00:08:39] is similar to this other thing whereas
[00:08:41] the mid order is very specific it's like
[00:08:43] no I've seen this exact thing before I
[00:08:45] like that you bring up pattern
[00:08:46] recognition because when we say
[00:08:47] something is a pattern in order for us
[00:08:49] to recognize that something as a pattern
[00:08:51] we need to be able to see how it sort of
[00:08:54] the structure that it creates it has to
[00:08:55] have that familiarity so pattern
[00:08:58] recognition is kind of a different thing
[00:08:59] because you can have pattern recognition
[00:09:00] for an isolated thing you can have
[00:09:02] pattern recognition for a broader thing
[00:09:04] what is going to determine whether it's
[00:09:07] pattern recognition or not is how
[00:09:08] familiar yeah it is to you so you can be
[00:09:11] isolated for something that's totally
[00:09:12] new or something that's familiar and you
[00:09:14] can be Broad and multi-connected and
[00:09:16] integrative in the thinking for
[00:09:17] something that is new or familiar
[00:09:18] pattern recognition is more of like a
[00:09:20] efficiency like time saving tendency of
[00:09:22] the brain it just uses less energy yeah
[00:09:25] yeah yeah yeah exactly it's a heuristic
[00:09:26] it's what we often call as system one
[00:09:28] thinking okay so let's use this and
[00:09:30] let's just try to map out what what are
[00:09:31] we doing at each of these processes and
[00:09:33] we want to be meta-cognitive about this
[00:09:34] in terms of what are the thoughts that
[00:09:36] are going on ahead so when information
[00:09:37] is coming in what are we doing with that
[00:09:40] information in a variety of contexts and
[00:09:42] be as specific as to when a new thought
[00:09:44] or A New Concept enters your brain for
[00:09:46] the first time for example like right
[00:09:48] now what is the thought process that is
[00:09:51] going on immediately start from the
[00:09:53] earliest possible moment that you have
[00:09:55] awareness of that thought so the first
[00:09:56] thing I do whenever information comes in
[00:09:58] is I do a two-part filtering process the
[00:10:00] first one is like is this important the
[00:10:02] second one is how can I simplify this
[00:10:04] and distill it down to the only part
[00:10:05] that I'm going to need okay good I'm
[00:10:07] going to build off of that in a second
[00:10:08] let's look at a few more ideas my first
[00:10:10] step is
[00:10:11] a little bit before that actually maybe
[00:10:13] a lot before that is just asking myself
[00:10:16] do I comprehend this information like is
[00:10:19] this something I fully understand I ask
[00:10:21] myself some questions like how does this
[00:10:24] actually apply to my life or a situation
[00:10:27] that I can refer to and then that
[00:10:30] confirms my comprehension of it that's
[00:10:31] good so that's actually the same
[00:10:33] underlying cognitive process that's
[00:10:35] happening with just different symptoms
[00:10:36] and that's actually I'm glad that these
[00:10:38] are the first two things that we heard
[00:10:39] because that's one of the most important
[00:10:41] things that we have to understand about
[00:10:42] learning to start really hacking it yeah
[00:10:43] so I'm going to build on that as well
[00:10:45] also just think about after you've
[00:10:46] learned something for the first time
[00:10:47] what are you doing with that information
[00:10:48] and what's the time delay between that
[00:10:51] activity like are you using it multiple
[00:10:52] times in a short period of time was
[00:10:54] there a long delay or does it vary it
[00:10:56] probably varies but in what situations
[00:10:58] would it vary if you've never thought
[00:11:00] about this before
[00:11:01] then that probably just means that you
[00:11:02] are a normal human being that lives in
[00:11:04] the society and you know that's really a
[00:11:06] societal issue that um we're here to
[00:11:08] solve
[00:11:09] yeah so I mean as soon as I've done my
[00:11:10] filtering processes
[00:11:12] um I take notes and then I go on at the
[00:11:16] earliest opportunity I go seek an
[00:11:17] opportunity to use the information
[00:11:19] um whether that's in a basic way that's
[00:11:21] going to be ultimately useless for me
[00:11:22] it's for the pure purpose of making it
[00:11:24] sink here okay so you will engage in
[00:11:26] activities that are functionally useless
[00:11:28] purely for the purpose of helping to
[00:11:31] consolidate knowledge correct okay yeah
[00:11:33] all right and you do that all of the
[00:11:34] time uh so this is in the context of my
[00:11:37] most common way of learning which is
[00:11:39] video courses or YouTube videos or
[00:11:41] normally learning via video or audio yep
[00:11:44] okay I think there's probably a step in
[00:11:46] between though between for example you
[00:11:48] said you take some notes on it yeah so
[00:11:50] I'd take like I get an Evernote and I
[00:11:52] actually but if I'm doing what say I'm
[00:11:54] doing a course that's got six modules
[00:11:55] each module I'll actually stop after
[00:11:57] that module and I'll go and try and
[00:11:58] Implement yeah so when we say take notes
[00:12:00] I want you to imagine that I'm just like
[00:12:02] a robot you need to program me to take
[00:12:04] these notes okay so I take screenshots
[00:12:06] of what really matters okay uh the most
[00:12:08] important thing is
[00:12:10] uh because I run my butt like yeah
[00:12:13] what's important yeah and then how do I
[00:12:15] how if I was to simplify this and
[00:12:16] distill it down so the only part I'm
[00:12:17] going to need the it's also what parts
[00:12:19] am I going to need to remember from
[00:12:21] there the screenshot is going to do a
[00:12:22] better job of illustrating that to me
[00:12:25] um than written notes if I can get Bible
[00:12:27] written notes and short bullet points
[00:12:29] then I'll do that that's how I'd
[00:12:30] normally technology right so you're
[00:12:31] aiming for that conciseness and and
[00:12:33] making sure that what you've got is like
[00:12:35] the minimal amount that serves the
[00:12:36] purpose of understanding the important
[00:12:38] information correct yeah okay good yep
[00:12:40] because it's only quite long form the
[00:12:42] information I'm taking in it's not still
[00:12:44] down in any way I've really got to wait
[00:12:46] for it correct correct yeah and in fact
[00:12:47] there's even research saying that the
[00:12:48] higher the word count of your notes the
[00:12:50] lower your performance is likely to be
[00:12:52] make sense yeah yeah because it likely
[00:12:54] means that the information was processed
[00:12:56] to a lower level yeah
[00:12:58] okay and that's probably a very similar
[00:13:00] process with different flavors around
[00:13:02] this room most people will probably do a
[00:13:04] similar sort of process of taking notes
[00:13:06] in a similar sort of way maybe the
[00:13:07] software is different and maybe the
[00:13:08] timing is a little bit different does
[00:13:09] anyone have a vastly different approach
[00:13:11] to processing and potentially
[00:13:13] documenting it I'm gonna explain that
[00:13:15] but also you'll see where my problem is
[00:13:17] right so I've come from a background
[00:13:19] where my business is about putting the
[00:13:21] director of operations into businesses
[00:13:23] and so a lot of what we do is very
[00:13:25] process Centric and so my challenge is
[00:13:28] now I'm I'm now in uh doing sales and
[00:13:31] marketing for my business and this is a
[00:13:33] foreign concept and someone has not come
[00:13:34] from this background right so my
[00:13:36] challenge which will relate to my
[00:13:38] learning technique is now I'm doing
[00:13:41] podcasting now I'm doing video marketing
[00:13:43] and trying to
[00:13:45] I will have had some scripts of bullet
[00:13:48] points and then I'm going to have to
[00:13:49] play that back in front of the camera so
[00:13:51] the way I tend to learn that is yeah
[00:13:53] make it shorter form to put key bullet
[00:13:56] points and then I uh do I guess a crude
[00:14:00] version of what you might have heard of
[00:14:01] as Roman room technique but I'll
[00:14:03] associate that with images or something
[00:14:05] to really make it high level yeah but
[00:14:07] even so that's still not many people not
[00:14:09] many people call it that that's the old
[00:14:11] name for that technique
[00:14:15] yeah people normally call it Memory
[00:14:17] Palace or method of loci now yeah that's
[00:14:19] the common term for it yeah I have not
[00:14:21] heard that term used in 15 years I think
[00:14:23] yeah
[00:14:26] so my problem is just recall really it's
[00:14:28] just simple recall of something I'm
[00:14:31] gonna be saying in front of a camera and
[00:14:34] I still use imagery to relate that sort
[00:14:37] of still link it to an application but
[00:14:40] um
[00:14:42] can I just ask you very quickly is that
[00:14:45] when you use that kind of method do you
[00:14:49] feel
[00:14:50] that that is a sort of a limited process
[00:14:53] like do you feel that that is quite a
[00:14:54] like a
[00:14:56] um a cumbersome process and you're just
[00:14:58] subjectively yeah I mean it's cumbersome
[00:15:00] and it takes effort to put it into that
[00:15:02] format for me to be able to play that
[00:15:04] back it works right if I could find a
[00:15:06] less common method of that that works
[00:15:09] yeah okay yeah let's dive into some of
[00:15:13] the like some very very very just basic
[00:15:15] theory around learning because we're
[00:15:17] going to see how all of these things are
[00:15:18] kind of similar at a first principle
[00:15:20] level why some things work and
[00:15:21] something's done and you can really take
[00:15:23] any way that someone learns and you can
[00:15:25] just adopt it and make it work better by
[00:15:27] doing this so what we're talking about
[00:15:29] is the idea of like cognitive
[00:15:30] architecture that's a term that we use
[00:15:32] for a cognitive architecture it
[00:15:33] basically means that it's a school of
[00:15:35] thought that just says that your brain
[00:15:37] is structured in a way and like your
[00:15:39] memory and your thoughts and your
[00:15:40] beliefs and self-conceptions and all
[00:15:41] these other things that make up your
[00:15:42] what you consider as your mind it's made
[00:15:44] up of like a network of ideas that are
[00:15:47] connected to each other and some of
[00:15:48] those connections are more important and
[00:15:50] some of them are less important and some
[00:15:52] nodes have more connections and some
[00:15:53] have less and this side there allows us
[00:15:56] to form these schemas of knowledge these
[00:15:59] sort of models of thinking so this is
[00:16:00] what allows you to have a how to think
[00:16:02] about something rather than the what to
[00:16:04] think about it colloquially when you're
[00:16:06] able to see how it connects together in
[00:16:09] such a a way that it starts to make
[00:16:11] sense and when you form the schema we
[00:16:13] colloquially call that a light bulb
[00:16:14] moment you haven't learned anything new
[00:16:16] you've learned the same thing but you're
[00:16:18] not able to see it in a way that you
[00:16:19] previously were not able to see it the
[00:16:20] time it takes to form a good mental
[00:16:24] model in a schema is one of the biggest
[00:16:26] delays where a lot of the time
[00:16:28] efficiency is actually lost there's a
[00:16:30] lot of learning and thinking and there's
[00:16:32] a lot of effort and load placed on our
[00:16:34] mind in order to try to figure out what
[00:16:35] that schema is and that's that period of
[00:16:37] learning where you're feeling kind of
[00:16:38] confused and you don't really know
[00:16:39] what's going on you know there's
[00:16:40] something going on but you haven't
[00:16:41] really quite figured it out yet and
[00:16:43] sometimes that process is extended like
[00:16:45] months you could be learning about
[00:16:47] something and you know you're on the
[00:16:48] brink of something but you haven't quite
[00:16:50] locked it in yet so what we want to do
[00:16:52] is we want to expedite that so how do we
[00:16:54] expedite the formation of a mental model
[00:16:56] so there's a couple ingredients that we
[00:16:58] need here number one we need the
[00:17:00] information that we're learning for it
[00:17:02] to be felt as being relevant and it
[00:17:04] seems like the most obvious thing when
[00:17:06] we say something is relevant we're
[00:17:08] actually talking about something having
[00:17:11] connections with our existing cognitive
[00:17:13] architecture that's what we assign
[00:17:15] relevance by my favorite example for
[00:17:17] this is can you tell me the third letter
[00:17:20] of the first license plate you saw today
[00:17:23] right that data came in to your brain
[00:17:27] the same as any other data that comes
[00:17:28] into your brain but your brain is
[00:17:30] eliminating that information from your
[00:17:31] memory at such a rate that you don't
[00:17:33] even realize that it was even entered
[00:17:35] into your brain to begin with
[00:17:37] I can remember
[00:17:46] yeah I'm serious because one's an Uber
[00:17:48] because you know what happened on
[00:17:49] Saturday we got into it
[00:17:51] because it was a white Uber I think he
[00:17:54] was driving for 10 minutes and someone
[00:17:56] canceled so this time when we got the
[00:17:58] movie today I definitely all right so
[00:18:01] that's a great yeah that's the perfect
[00:18:03] example of like the you know the same
[00:18:05] data you know because maybe some of you
[00:18:07] saw that same Uber maybe you saw it
[00:18:09] driving right but you know you wouldn't
[00:18:11] have picked up on that when he said our
[00:18:13] ebh 1025 or whatever it is no one was
[00:18:15] like that's the 50th license plate I saw
[00:18:17] today oh I remember suddenly it doesn't
[00:18:18] happen that way that relevance that
[00:18:20] we're assigning something that is
[00:18:22] actually a controllable process
[00:18:23] relevance doesn't have to be something
[00:18:25] that is inherent to the information
[00:18:27] because relevance is dictated by us
[00:18:29] we're the ones that assign something
[00:18:31] relevant the information in itself is
[00:18:33] just raw data so once we understand how
[00:18:35] we can create relevance forcibly for
[00:18:38] information that magical effects on your
[00:18:40] memory and ability to hold on to it
[00:18:41] which then allows you to manipulate that
[00:18:43] information to form these models so
[00:18:45] that's kind of that first ingredient so
[00:18:47] always remember that your brain is
[00:18:49] pretty efficient at learning as an organ
[00:18:52] in itself it does not compare to how
[00:18:54] efficient it is at forgetting
[00:18:55] information the billions of information
[00:18:57] that enters your brain every second you
[00:18:59] know almost all of it is completely
[00:19:01] disregarded because learning is
[00:19:03] extremely energy consuming we want to
[00:19:05] limit that as much as possible so your
[00:19:07] brain will aggressively get rid of any
[00:19:10] information that it does not deem as
[00:19:11] relevant you know when you're sort of
[00:19:13] learning something and you're thinking
[00:19:14] to yourself I don't really get it like
[00:19:16] I'm not really sure how it fits I feel
[00:19:19] like the only way for me to learn this
[00:19:20] is going to be to like just repeat this
[00:19:21] like a few times maybe it's like a
[00:19:23] speech or a script that you've written
[00:19:24] or something and you're just going over
[00:19:26] it again and you just feel that without
[00:19:28] having that repetition you're just it's
[00:19:30] just gonna slip that is your brain
[00:19:32] saying this is not relevant right that
[00:19:34] is the indicator of your brain saying
[00:19:36] this is not right it does not fit with
[00:19:37] my existing schema of knowledge and you
[00:19:39] what you are doing is that you're trying
[00:19:40] to bypass that through Force Through
[00:19:42] Brute Force the analogy of you know
[00:19:44] those baby toys where you have like the
[00:19:46] square like the cube and then you have
[00:19:47] like the square and then you put it
[00:19:49] through the thing and then that's a
[00:19:50] circle in the circle you know it's like
[00:19:51] taking the square the cube and having
[00:19:53] like the circular hole and you're just
[00:19:55] like smashing it through that hole
[00:19:57] repeatedly until it fits like yes
[00:19:59] eventually it will fit but it will be
[00:20:01] distorted and your hand will be bleeding
[00:20:02] and you've got like wood splinters in
[00:20:04] your eyeballs and you know and it takes
[00:20:06] like an entire hour together then
[00:20:07] everything is destroyed that's what the
[00:20:09] process looks like when you're trying to
[00:20:11] force something through when it doesn't
[00:20:13] feel that's relevant so step number one
[00:20:15] is start tuning into that feeling at any
[00:20:17] point when you feel like it's not
[00:20:19] clicking because I don't really see how
[00:20:20] it fits be aware of that sort of process
[00:20:23] and if you feel that the only way to
[00:20:24] overcome that is through something
[00:20:25] that's repetitive then use that as an
[00:20:28] indicator to flick up to a higher level
[00:20:30] of thinking which I'm going to go over
[00:20:31] shortly how can we create relevance how
[00:20:35] can we force something to become
[00:20:37] relevant so Tony Robbins has a process
[00:20:40] on this um I've been through all his
[00:20:42] stuff it was something that was quite
[00:20:43] helpful one of them was basically before
[00:20:45] I go and learn something
[00:20:47] um tell myself why I'm learning it so
[00:20:49] actually defining clearly the reason I'm
[00:20:52] doing this is because of this reason and
[00:20:54] then I'm going into it and I'm forcing
[00:20:55] the relevance I guess yeah and now I
[00:20:57] know what he was doing yeah that's a
[00:20:58] very good sort of starting technique
[00:21:00] that you can use to just start priming
[00:21:03] your brain to receive information it's
[00:21:04] just kind of you know prepping it we can
[00:21:06] take that in other three levels higher
[00:21:08] yeah so that but that's a good place to
[00:21:10] start with but we can do more than that
[00:21:12] Stakes are the other thing that do it
[00:21:14] for me steaks so yeah that does this
[00:21:18] does this matter in my whole life on
[00:21:20] what level of my life does this matter
[00:21:22] is it about my income is it about
[00:21:23] whatever if I've got to learn something
[00:21:24] but the thing is that not all learning
[00:21:27] that you engage with and necessarily
[00:21:29] have the stakes associated with it and
[00:21:31] it doesn't I make myself go if I don't
[00:21:33] learn this
[00:21:34] I put myself through that scenario and
[00:21:37] then it forces me to learn it yeah I
[00:21:39] mean uh I I think you know if it works
[00:21:41] it's good but um I don't know if that's
[00:21:43] the best sustainable way to you know you
[00:21:46] don't want to think back on your life
[00:21:47] and just feel like man my life was
[00:21:49] torture because I just everything I had
[00:21:51] to learn I had to you know hold myself
[00:21:53] at gunpoint so very easy way that we can
[00:21:55] force relevance to something is to
[00:21:58] actually start with relevance so the
[00:22:01] normal way of approaching information is
[00:22:03] like this information comes in we think
[00:22:05] about the information and then we
[00:22:07] retrieve that information and this
[00:22:09] process in the middle all we're trying
[00:22:10] to do here is think well why is this
[00:22:12] relevant and how is it relevant how can
[00:22:13] it fit and how can it make sense of that
[00:22:14] right so instead of doing that what
[00:22:17] we're going to do is start here
[00:22:19] and we're gonna go out
[00:22:21] and we're going to make that a step
[00:22:23] number one so if you're learning
[00:22:25] something for the first time and you're
[00:22:26] learning it brand new before actually
[00:22:28] going into actually learn about it get a
[00:22:31] big wide scope of everything that you
[00:22:33] know that you're going to learn in the
[00:22:35] span of this so if it's a course you
[00:22:36] know get a course outline or you know
[00:22:38] make a list of all the keywords or all
[00:22:39] the terminologies or anything like that
[00:22:41] if you're reading from let's say that
[00:22:42] you've got a new book that you've read
[00:22:44] get a book summary or flick through the
[00:22:47] book very quickly and just look for
[00:22:48] headings bold words diagrams paragraphs
[00:22:51] that seem like it's talking about a
[00:22:52] certain idea you can do an entire book
[00:22:54] let's say 200 Pages you can do that in
[00:22:55] 20 minutes right all you're doing is
[00:22:57] just making a list of all just the words
[00:22:59] okay what's important here is that that
[00:23:01] list is not ordered any specific way I
[00:23:03] don't want any hierarchy I don't want
[00:23:04] anything boldered I don't want anything
[00:23:06] indented nothing like that in fact it's
[00:23:08] even better to make this list out of
[00:23:10] order of the order that you first did it
[00:23:12] you maybe start the book back to front
[00:23:14] start in the middle move outwards it's
[00:23:15] important that we start with an
[00:23:18] unordered list because it breaks the
[00:23:21] cognitive bias of tending to think about
[00:23:23] it and same way it was presented to us
[00:23:25] but the author of the book I can
[00:23:27] guarantee you was not thinking about you
[00:23:28] when they wrote that book so by Design
[00:23:31] the way the information is presented is
[00:23:33] never really going to be cognitively
[00:23:34] optimized for you and your knowledge
[00:23:36] schema we don't want to run into the
[00:23:38] Trap of understanding it in the way the
[00:23:40] author thought about it because what's
[00:23:42] happening with learning and teaching is
[00:23:44] that we have this fluid you know
[00:23:47] omnidirectional schema of knowledge and
[00:23:49] this is what we know when we think about
[00:23:51] a topic that we're very specialized in
[00:23:52] if you think about that your area of
[00:23:54] specialization and your business you
[00:23:55] know that you have a better knowledge
[00:23:56] about that than most people that you're
[00:23:58] going to meet about that particular
[00:23:59] topic and so that knowledge is not
[00:24:02] something that starts in any particular
[00:24:03] order it's not linear you can start at
[00:24:05] any point and go in any other direction
[00:24:07] very fluidly but in order for you to
[00:24:09] teach someone about that let's say you
[00:24:10] become the author of the book and you
[00:24:12] need to teach someone about this you now
[00:24:13] need to linearize and order this
[00:24:15] information in a way that you think
[00:24:17] makes sense for the reader so if the
[00:24:19] reader takes that information and learns
[00:24:21] it in that format their knowledge is not
[00:24:24] going to be your knowledge because your
[00:24:26] knowledge was distilled and simplified
[00:24:28] and funneled through pen and paper or
[00:24:30] you know through the printing press
[00:24:31] through the limitations of how that
[00:24:33] knowledge could be communicated so what
[00:24:35] the learner's job is to take that and
[00:24:37] then re-package it in a way that most
[00:24:40] closely resembles that Omni directional
[00:24:42] fluid structure right I think we all
[00:24:44] know this kind of intuitively well some
[00:24:46] people don't know this intuitively right
[00:24:47] and they just take it as is when we
[00:24:49] start with learning we've got these you
[00:24:51] know maybe one book or a range of
[00:24:52] resources we're going to take that list
[00:24:54] of keywords and terminology and main
[00:24:56] ideas and we're going to make this list
[00:24:57] and we're going to do it out of order
[00:24:58] with no indentation no boating nothing
[00:25:00] it's just a list of words plain as can
[00:25:02] be and that's going to help us to break
[00:25:04] away from seeing it and the author's
[00:25:06] mode of thinking and then from that
[00:25:08] you're just going to scan through this
[00:25:10] list if there is a word there that you
[00:25:12] look at and you just think I have
[00:25:13] absolutely no idea what it means I look
[00:25:15] at it and I literally do not have any
[00:25:17] idea what it means which is uncommon
[00:25:19] then go and look it up a little bit more
[00:25:21] read about a little bit more read a few
[00:25:23] sentences about it know spend 30 seconds
[00:25:24] to just generally get your head around
[00:25:26] what that word means and this might take
[00:25:28] you another I don't know five ten
[00:25:29] minutes now you're going to take this
[00:25:30] list and you're going to try to create
[00:25:32] that fluid mental model that schema that
[00:25:36] omnidirectional that kind of network of
[00:25:38] thought purely based on what you
[00:25:40] understand about this list of words so
[00:25:42] what we're doing is we're sort of
[00:25:43] skipping the process of trying to
[00:25:44] understand it and you know comprehending
[00:25:47] it fully and all of that sort of stuff
[00:25:48] we're just going to create a hypothesis
[00:25:51] about I think this information will be
[00:25:54] structured in this way and that because
[00:25:56] of the fact that we're working with with
[00:25:58] almost nothing it forces us to rely only
[00:26:01] on our prior existing knowledge step and
[00:26:03] so we'll end up forming this model that
[00:26:05] could be you know 30 of it might need to
[00:26:07] be modified and changed because it was
[00:26:08] inaccurate or something like that but
[00:26:10] we'll form this overarching structure
[00:26:12] about how the knowledge works and then
[00:26:13] at that point we have a schema we have
[00:26:16] that how to think about that mental
[00:26:17] model that normally takes months to
[00:26:19] develop we have a hypothesis about what
[00:26:21] it might look like before we've even
[00:26:23] really started learning about it so that
[00:26:26] model that we've created that was built
[00:26:27] fundamentally off the foundation of our
[00:26:29] prior knowledge everything to do with
[00:26:31] anything in that model is now relevant
[00:26:33] because you generated this model
[00:26:34] everything is testing a hypothesis new
[00:26:37] information comes in oh yeah that fits
[00:26:38] in with how I thought about it
[00:26:40] previously oh it's different to how I
[00:26:41] thought about it differently but like
[00:26:42] how is it different why is it different
[00:26:44] oh and therefore the type of thinking
[00:26:46] that we can have about it is
[00:26:47] automatically at a higher level so
[00:26:49] normally the process would be understand
[00:26:50] what we're learning first you know to a
[00:26:52] decent amount and then as we're going
[00:26:54] through we're processing and building
[00:26:55] models sort of as we go but the problem
[00:26:58] with doing it that way
[00:26:59] is that
[00:27:00] uh information just becomes too
[00:27:02] disorganized too scattered it's kind of
[00:27:04] like a map of a city that has no
[00:27:06] highways you can get from one point to
[00:27:08] another point but the rows that you need
[00:27:10] to take is just you know everywhere so
[00:27:12] you might start with you know saying
[00:27:13] okay here's one point I'm not really
[00:27:15] sure what it means you learn a little
[00:27:16] bit about it and then you have this
[00:27:17] point and then you know you might say
[00:27:19] well are they connected no they're not
[00:27:20] and you learn about this point and these
[00:27:22] three are still not connected and you've
[00:27:23] got this point and by that time you're
[00:27:24] sort of semi-forgetting this point and
[00:27:26] then you think oh this is related to
[00:27:28] this thing and then you're going off and
[00:27:29] you know learning more things and you're
[00:27:30] creating these sorts of so this is
[00:27:33] generally what learning ends up kind of
[00:27:35] looking like is that you form these sort
[00:27:37] of structures as you kind of go and what
[00:27:39] you can hopefully see is that there are
[00:27:42] relationships and connections that are
[00:27:43] forming but it's very hard to see what
[00:27:45] is actually going on right it's there's
[00:27:47] not really even much on there and
[00:27:49] already assigned to become difficulty if
[00:27:51] someone looks at that they're not going
[00:27:52] to get a clear picture of it and so if
[00:27:54] this is the state of organization of
[00:27:55] that knowledge in your mind then that's
[00:27:57] the extent through which you're going to
[00:27:58] be able to retrieve it going from here
[00:27:59] to here is going to be like I know that
[00:28:01] you can kind of do something there but
[00:28:03] then there's this other part that comes
[00:28:04] in and so it's it's very disorganized
[00:28:06] right
[00:28:07] by starting with just the basics we're
[00:28:09] saying that okay we understand that all
[00:28:11] these things are probably related in
[00:28:12] some way and I think it's probably going
[00:28:14] to be something that looks like this
[00:28:17] and we're starting with just a very very
[00:28:19] basic skeleton of it we've got the big
[00:28:21] picture of it the whole scope of it to
[00:28:23] begin with when you learn the first
[00:28:25] piece of information you're already
[00:28:26] thinking about the last piece of
[00:28:27] information how it might relate when you
[00:28:29] normally learn linearly from start to
[00:28:31] finish you're not even aware about what
[00:28:33] you need to be thinking about later on
[00:28:35] to even have the thought to potentially
[00:28:37] connect it so everything becomes kind of
[00:28:39] retrospective whereas now when you learn
[00:28:41] that new information you're thinking
[00:28:42] okay it could fit here here or here well
[00:28:44] I know it's going to be related to this
[00:28:45] thing but I also know it's probably
[00:28:47] going to have a relationship over here
[00:28:48] so now you're thinking I'm not going to
[00:28:51] organize the information you know like
[00:28:52] way out over here because it has to
[00:28:54] connect with the stuff that's over here
[00:28:55] at some point somehow that already
[00:28:58] starts framing the context and the
[00:29:00] relevance and the purpose of the
[00:29:01] information differently this is called
[00:29:03] integrative learning and the idea is
[00:29:05] that we are trying to integrate the
[00:29:07] learning as quickly as possible we're
[00:29:09] creating almost a mold that information
[00:29:11] can sit in as soon as it it's there
[00:29:13] rather than having each individual
[00:29:15] component and then going through it
[00:29:16] retrospectively to try to to figure it
[00:29:18] all out and then cleaning it up and then
[00:29:19] going back to the resource and then
[00:29:20] looking at it again and then fixing this
[00:29:22] we're saying this is probably how it's
[00:29:24] going to be I'll shift a few things
[00:29:25] around as I learn but as I'm taking more
[00:29:27] information in I will just be building
[00:29:29] and consolidating it as a big picture to
[00:29:32] begin with so it's kind of like if
[00:29:33] you're sculpting something out of stone
[00:29:35] you wouldn't take a stone block and then
[00:29:37] you wouldn't you wouldn't scope like a
[00:29:38] perfect nose in like a perfect eyeball
[00:29:40] and then you know work your way through
[00:29:42] that and everything's gonna be out of
[00:29:43] proportion and it's gonna be in the
[00:29:44] wrong place you're going to get the
[00:29:45] general shape of it first and then
[00:29:46] you're going to go in progressively
[00:29:47] further detail if you're painting a wall
[00:29:49] you're going to do that primer layer
[00:29:50] first and then you're going to go over
[00:29:51] it again again we're working out
[00:29:53] knowledge in layers of Mastery rather
[00:29:55] than order of information
[00:29:57] changes right so the big thing about how
[00:30:01] this system is novel is that no one else
[00:30:03] really tells you to flip it because it's
[00:30:05] actually very counter-intuitive it's
[00:30:07] very counter-intuitive to try to achieve
[00:30:09] essentially Mastery over a topic before
[00:30:11] you even understand what the concepts
[00:30:13] individually are but the idea is that no
[00:30:16] matter how you learn it you're going to
[00:30:18] you know have have questions and doubts
[00:30:19] and you're going to reform that schema
[00:30:21] you're forming anyway at some point and
[00:30:23] no matter what you're learning if it's
[00:30:25] not relevant if it does not fit
[00:30:27] somewhere you're cognitively you're
[00:30:28] going to struggle with it so those are
[00:30:30] objective truths so therefore if we can
[00:30:32] increase the relevance and if we can
[00:30:34] make it so that the revisions of our
[00:30:35] knowledge that we're doing are just more
[00:30:37] productive since we're doing them anyway
[00:30:38] then we're able to achieve a level of
[00:30:40] Mastery of learning that's far beyond
[00:30:42] sorry not necessarily Beyond in terms of
[00:30:44] the Mastery but much faster than you
[00:30:46] would normally be able to achieve right
[00:30:48] so if I was I mean I'm an audible
[00:30:50] listener right so if I now wanted to
[00:30:53] apply something like this I might find
[00:30:55] the book summary yes right my list of
[00:30:58] words yes research a bit around what
[00:31:01] those particular topics were yes but
[00:31:03] then go from start to finish no no after
[00:31:06] you do that you then need to create some
[00:31:08] kind of schematic and you can put this
[00:31:09] in you know this kind of format you
[00:31:11] could have a you know a paper where you
[00:31:12] jot it down you could I personally
[00:31:13] really encourage you know people so
[00:31:16] normally when we think about note taking
[00:31:17] we're thinking like learning at school
[00:31:19] or like you know sitting in lectures or
[00:31:20] something but the ideal way of using
[00:31:23] note taking is to cognitively accelerate
[00:31:25] your learning if you do note taking
[00:31:27] correctly what what it does is it
[00:31:28] offloads unnecessary cognitive resources
[00:31:31] instead of having to hold on to all of
[00:31:33] it you're just speeding up the process
[00:31:35] of it so you would map it out on
[00:31:37] something so I personally use an
[00:31:38] infinite canvas app on a tablet because
[00:31:40] it allows my knowledge to grow
[00:31:41] organically in in all directions I'm not
[00:31:43] restricted by Page size which personally
[00:31:45] I believe is the stupidest possible
[00:31:46] reason for knowledge to be restricted is
[00:31:48] because of page size
[00:31:50] you know what if we were just born into
[00:31:51] a world that A1 is the norm you know
[00:31:53] like what everyone will be a genius
[00:31:55] um so in this example here you would
[00:31:58] reorder the table
[00:32:00] TS okay
[00:32:01] uh the answer will be yes but it's very
[00:32:03] important that you're trying not to see
[00:32:05] it in terms of a table of contents to
[00:32:06] begin with because even the idea of
[00:32:08] seeing it in terms of table of contents
[00:32:10] will influence the way you're likely to
[00:32:12] structure it so if you shuffled it if
[00:32:14] you just make a list Shuffle it yeah
[00:32:16] there's a little random shelf load and
[00:32:18] then you try to create a schemer and try
[00:32:19] to draw out how you think that's going
[00:32:20] to link together that that would be a
[00:32:22] great starting point yes that would be a
[00:32:23] great starting point and the important
[00:32:24] part here is that there's two things
[00:32:26] that you should try to follow number one
[00:32:27] try to do it relatively clean try to
[00:32:30] make it relatively simple to follow like
[00:32:32] we're working big picture you don't need
[00:32:33] to have every single keyword planted on
[00:32:35] here but you should have what you think
[00:32:37] are like you know basically all of the
[00:32:38] main and important ones because you
[00:32:40] might look at one thing and know already
[00:32:41] that is just simply one example of this
[00:32:45] other concept it's not going to be
[00:32:46] important in itself you don't need to
[00:32:48] have that one on your overall starting
[00:32:49] structure but the main concept that it's
[00:32:51] tied to that should be integrated
[00:32:52] somehow so try to make it as simple as
[00:32:55] possible and then number two follow what
[00:32:57] I call the 2-4 rule which is that
[00:32:59] information should be grouped together
[00:33:01] you do not want 100 pieces of
[00:33:02] information with just like 100 you know
[00:33:03] 700 arrows everywhere this can be
[00:33:06] grouped together this can be grouped
[00:33:07] together this can be grouped together
[00:33:08] this can be grouped together the reason
[00:33:09] we do it out of order is because the
[00:33:11] order you group it and needs to make
[00:33:12] sense for you which is not necessarily
[00:33:14] the way that it's presented to you in
[00:33:15] fact in my experience around 60 to 70 of
[00:33:17] all the groups you will form for
[00:33:18] knowledge across any domain end up being
[00:33:20] different how it is initially presented
[00:33:22] to you you know you're going to look at
[00:33:23] all this information and think well how
[00:33:24] can I group this in a way that makes
[00:33:25] sense and therefore you're going to do a
[00:33:27] lot of this back and forth thinking a
[00:33:29] lot of this kind of comparing and
[00:33:30] contrasting and I want you to notice
[00:33:32] even at this very early stage before
[00:33:34] you've even really looked at it linearly
[00:33:36] before you've started consuming
[00:33:37] information already you are engaging in
[00:33:39] the type of back and forth thinking that
[00:33:42] you know you are going to need to start
[00:33:43] doing when you actually retrieve it at a
[00:33:45] high level that's how you think about
[00:33:47] stuff that you are good at knowledge
[00:33:49] that you're confident and that's the
[00:33:50] type of thinking you do so we're
[00:33:51] engaging in that type of thinking before
[00:33:52] we even know what it is we're really
[00:33:54] thinking about and this is a this is a
[00:33:56] big cognitive hack you know it allows
[00:33:58] you to retain information much more
[00:34:00] easily and it allows you to build that
[00:34:01] Mastery more quickly and what do you
[00:34:03] call playback and what you call it you
[00:34:04] call that like a schema for this yeah so
[00:34:07] there's different ways that you can call
[00:34:09] it you know some people call it models
[00:34:10] some people call it schemas there's
[00:34:12] different terminologies that I use in
[00:34:13] the program that I run that associate
[00:34:15] more things with it it doesn't really
[00:34:16] matter what the label you associate with
[00:34:18] it is but so it really comes down to
[00:34:20] that pre-work I've got my list I'm now
[00:34:22] trying to create an order I'm going to
[00:34:25] say order but create some rationality
[00:34:27] structure of how it links together yes
[00:34:30] so that it's that more simple flow
[00:34:32] through but then as you do eventually
[00:34:34] then
[00:34:35] I'm assuming you could then do take in
[00:34:37] the book in normal format yeah well
[00:34:40] actually what you'll find is that once
[00:34:41] you do that you may not even want to
[00:34:42] take it into the normal format because
[00:34:44] you may find that already through the
[00:34:46] just the pure process of doing this you
[00:34:48] are already achieving a level of
[00:34:50] knowledge on the estate is
[00:34:52] seems impossible where you feel more
[00:34:54] confident about this topic than you
[00:34:56] really should be given that you don't
[00:34:57] really know anything about it but you
[00:34:59] already sort of see how it can you know
[00:35:01] come together and you are assigning more
[00:35:03] and more relevant to certain parts and
[00:35:04] you're starting to apply the knowledge
[00:35:05] before you even know what it is you're
[00:35:07] applying so you may think I actually
[00:35:08] want to start here right so you could
[00:35:10] just start there if you wanted to in
[00:35:12] fact a lot of the times what I'll do is
[00:35:13] I'll have like you know two or three or
[00:35:15] three or four books that I'm looking
[00:35:16] through and I'll make this as a keyword
[00:35:17] and then I'll go through it and then
[00:35:18] I'll just start going into where I want
[00:35:20] to start and I'll just use Google and by
[00:35:22] time I finish I don't actually even need
[00:35:23] the book so what I do with the book is I
[00:35:25] just flick through it to see is there
[00:35:26] anything I missed and there's always
[00:35:27] something that I missed but it means
[00:35:28] that the learning is driven by me I'm in
[00:35:31] control of every single process and I'm
[00:35:33] optimizing everything any information
[00:35:34] that comes in it's because I want it to
[00:35:35] come in it's relevant because I wanted
[00:35:37] it to be there and it serves a purpose
[00:35:39] every time there's no thinking about how
[00:35:41] does it serve a purpose and how can I
[00:35:42] make this relevant it's relevant because
[00:35:44] it was relevant to begin with
[00:35:46] right that makes sense yeah and why is
[00:35:48] it called the 24 rule ah yes so
[00:35:51] um so you were creating these groups you
[00:35:53] you always want each group to have only
[00:35:56] two things in it and a maximum of four
[00:35:58] okay so you'll have groups and then
[00:36:00] subgroups within those groups so if
[00:36:01] you've got like one big thing and then
[00:36:03] underneath that is like 20 other
[00:36:04] Concepts break that into if you can two
[00:36:07] subgroups and a maximum of four this is
[00:36:09] basically the type of schema that you
[00:36:10] might end up forming there's a few
[00:36:12] things I want you to notice with this is
[00:36:14] that number one the information flows in
[00:36:17] multiple directions it doesn't do what I
[00:36:19] call water falling so this would be an
[00:36:20] example of water falling okay let's
[00:36:21] start with a conventional model this is
[00:36:23] what water falling looks like
[00:36:28] right
[00:36:29] you can see why it's called waterfalling
[00:36:31] what's the problem with this knowledge
[00:36:32] does not look like that not not real
[00:36:34] expertise this is exactly what it looks
[00:36:36] like for someone that has really done
[00:36:38] well at trying to learn the way that the
[00:36:40] textbook grouped for them because that's
[00:36:42] fully linear right so this we are
[00:36:45] avoiding this through that reordering
[00:36:46] process and it's very hard to avoid
[00:36:48] doing this without taking a deliberate
[00:36:50] step to break that because it's a
[00:36:52] cognitive bias that operates on
[00:36:53] autopilot before you're able to really
[00:36:55] react to it it's already been reframed a
[00:36:57] little bit so we don't want water
[00:36:59] falling but waterfalling can look like
[00:37:01] this as well
[00:37:04] right it doesn't have to be necessarily
[00:37:06] down the page this also is waterfalling
[00:37:09] right and for most people this is what a
[00:37:11] mind map looks like but this is
[00:37:13] waterfall you can see it's essentially
[00:37:15] just radially coming out but it's the
[00:37:16] same thing so what this is lacking is
[00:37:18] laterality of thinking so if you saw
[00:37:21] information like this
[00:37:23] and then you demonstrate it expressed it
[00:37:25] like this and then now you're saying oh
[00:37:27] I want to add laterality to the
[00:37:28] information then it's going to look like
[00:37:30] this
[00:37:37] okay that's what I'll end up looking
[00:37:39] like and now you can't follow that
[00:37:41] there's too much going on and the reason
[00:37:43] is because laterality which is inherent
[00:37:45] to the knowledge was added
[00:37:46] retrospectively the structure itself is
[00:37:49] fundamentally wrong and we're trying to
[00:37:51] make it work by just adding arrows into
[00:37:52] it the problem is not that we're trying
[00:37:55] to think about that the problem is that
[00:37:56] we're thinking about that after the fact
[00:37:57] this is what happens when you also learn
[00:37:58] linearly is that you have a structure
[00:38:00] but the structure is not something that
[00:38:02] actually makes sense it doesn't operate
[00:38:04] the way true knowledge operates so this
[00:38:06] is what we want to avoid so when you're
[00:38:08] looking at my thing notice that there is
[00:38:10] laterality but the laterality is not
[00:38:12] just going everywhere all over the page
[00:38:14] you know there are no lines that cross
[00:38:16] each other there are no arrows across
[00:38:17] each other everything is there is
[00:38:19] laterality and there's structure and
[00:38:20] then there is a flow and there's a
[00:38:21] Simplicity but it's represented cleanly
[00:38:24] and also there is no group on there that
[00:38:26] has more than four things coming out of
[00:38:27] it at any point I call that a chunk map
[00:38:29] because what you're forming are these
[00:38:30] chunks uh that chunk map obviously it
[00:38:33] looks like there's you know a decent
[00:38:34] amount of information on there so this
[00:38:36] is over 500 pages of information
[00:38:38] distilled on that that's Journal
[00:38:40] articles that's textbook chapters that's
[00:38:42] my whole Masters paper on that I made
[00:38:44] that in one study session and then I was
[00:38:47] invited to be a lecturer for that topic
[00:38:49] before I even finished the paper so the
[00:38:51] Mastery that you're able to get through
[00:38:53] this is it allows you to achieve the
[00:38:55] Mastery that is sort of unnatural to
[00:38:57] achieve it allows you to have a problem
[00:38:59] or a certain field of learning that
[00:39:01] you're interested in and engage in that
[00:39:03] learning and then after a week you're
[00:39:06] talking to people that have been
[00:39:07] studying this for years and they will be
[00:39:08] you're not going to know more than them
[00:39:10] the value you can extract from
[00:39:11] interacting with that expertise that's
[00:39:13] going to be efficient level you're going
[00:39:15] to get more value out of that does
[00:39:16] reckoning surface level of knowledge of
[00:39:18] the entire landscape first and then
[00:39:20] building up the Mastery in different
[00:39:22] areas because they're all interconnected
[00:39:23] as you need yes yeah and you could do it
[00:39:26] linearly if you wanted to if you've done
[00:39:28] these first steps well if you do it
[00:39:30] linearly that's okay as well it's not
[00:39:31] technically as Optimum as it could be
[00:39:33] compared to just going into it as you as
[00:39:35] you want to have done it like this just
[00:39:37] naturally and and I've picked stuff up
[00:39:39] way faster yeah and the times when I've
[00:39:41] tried to go the other way where I've
[00:39:42] tried to master the individual step
[00:39:43] before getting the whole picture like
[00:39:45] when I was learning salsa it was
[00:39:46] terrible
[00:39:48] it was it was one picture I just
[00:39:50] couldn't learn But the teacher was
[00:39:51] trying to get me to master this first
[00:39:52] step and no you're going to get that
[00:39:53] right before we move on yeah I would say
[00:39:56] other people who like the whole picture
[00:39:57] and did it all poorly and put it
[00:39:58] together learn everything a lot faster
[00:40:00] yeah so the difference here is in terms
[00:40:02] of what we call lower or higher like
[00:40:04] orders of learning versus orders of
[00:40:07] thinking so a high order of thing King
[00:40:11] allows you to achieve both high and low
[00:40:14] levels of actual Mastery whereas a low
[00:40:17] order of thinking only allows you to
[00:40:19] achieve a low level and so if you're
[00:40:20] focusing on things in isolation and just
[00:40:22] learning one thing at a time it's true
[00:40:24] you need to know the basics to be able
[00:40:25] to navigate the higher levels that's
[00:40:27] unavoidable fact you cannot talk about a
[00:40:28] concept without knowing what the concept
[00:40:30] is but the method of how you understand
[00:40:32] that concept do you use a lower order
[00:40:34] method of thinking to achieve it or do
[00:40:36] you use a higher order method to achieve
[00:40:37] it higher order means integrated
[00:40:39] therefore it means more relevant so
[00:40:41] you're still learning the same thing but
[00:40:42] now it has context integrated your
[00:40:45] boosting connections to other topics to
[00:40:47] increase its level of relevance correct
[00:40:49] and the important part is that what
[00:40:51] we're boosting is the connections that
[00:40:52] we're forming to prior knowledge we're
[00:40:54] starting with the prior knowledge
[00:40:55] because what you do is you're boosting
[00:40:57] connections purely just connections
[00:40:58] without first starting with a schema
[00:41:01] from what you already know then the
[00:41:02] difficulty with that is that you end up
[00:41:04] falling what I call an island which is a
[00:41:06] well-connected schema of knowledge that
[00:41:07] is actually separate from your main body
[00:41:09] of knowledge so a symptom of that would
[00:41:11] be that you have a good understanding of
[00:41:13] that knowledge but you will still
[00:41:15] struggle to apply that in nuanced ways
[00:41:17] or you will require cueing to be able to
[00:41:19] engage in that type of thinking most
[00:41:21] common way that you may have experienced
[00:41:22] is if you've worked with like very
[00:41:24] intelligent new grads that have a lot of
[00:41:26] knowledge but you really need to cue
[00:41:28] them to start thinking about it once you
[00:41:30] cue them you're like oh yeah and they
[00:41:31] can grow with it but being able to
[00:41:33] themselves apply it is separate because
[00:41:36] their knowledge schema is not actually
[00:41:37] connected with it it kind of reminds me
[00:41:39] of Feynman who used to do the Christmas
[00:41:40] lectures and the Nobel Prize winner yeah
[00:41:42] he was well known to be able to take a
[00:41:44] really complex topic like you know
[00:41:46] nuclear physics and explain that to kids
[00:41:48] because you could very link it to prior
[00:41:51] knowledge yeah so a lot of his work is
[00:41:53] you know a lot of the stuff kind of
[00:41:54] Builds on and extends some of his work
[00:41:56] yeah because the idea here is that if
[00:41:58] you're able to do the very simplified
[00:41:59] big picture schema then that's
[00:42:01] essentially what you need to be able to
[00:42:03] explain something to uh you know like a
[00:42:04] five-year-old because it's not just
[00:42:05] explaining to a five-year-old it's
[00:42:07] explaining comprehensively and
[00:42:08] accurately the main important points and
[00:42:10] the main important rate relationships in
[00:42:12] such a way that it's simple to
[00:42:12] understand right it's not just purely
[00:42:14] explaining something to a five-year-old
[00:42:16] right which you know you can do with
[00:42:17] anything just use simpler terms it's
[00:42:19] about the comprehensiveness and the
[00:42:20] accuracy of it so this level of Mastery
[00:42:23] and building that is what we are aiming
[00:42:25] for the difference is that we're trying
[00:42:26] to build that before we even have a good
[00:42:29] understanding of the topic itself most
[00:42:31] people that are professionals that have
[00:42:33] some real world learning kind of
[00:42:34] experience you already will have many of
[00:42:37] the elements of thinking that we've
[00:42:39] talked about here and a lot of the
[00:42:40] things that you found work for you will
[00:42:42] be using certain elements of this and
[00:42:44] what we're doing is we're just creating
[00:42:45] a full system out well it's not really a
[00:42:47] full system yet but like we're creating
[00:42:48] at least a comprehensive technique out
[00:42:50] of it and what you should feel is that
[00:42:53] sort of restrictions on your learning
[00:42:55] that you previously didn't even know
[00:42:56] where there start being lifted things
[00:42:58] just start becoming easier to understand
[00:43:00] like everything clicks that light bulb
[00:43:03] moment it should just be every concept
[00:43:05] is light bulb moment just constantly
[00:43:07] right to the point where it would be
[00:43:09] unusual for you to learn something and
[00:43:11] not have that light bulb moment at an
[00:43:13] extremely early stage that should become
[00:43:15] the norm and for most people that have
[00:43:16] this sort of learning experience if they
[00:43:17] apply this kind of thinking you'll
[00:43:19] probably be able to achieve something
[00:43:20] like that within just the first few
[00:43:21] attempts of it the very first time you
[00:43:23] do this you'll realize that it's a lot
[00:43:25] more complicated than I've just made it
[00:43:27] out to be because there's just so many
[00:43:28] thoughts going through your head in
[00:43:29] terms of like does it make sense to do
[00:43:30] this am I meant to do it this way like
[00:43:31] can I group it this way but then I could
[00:43:32] group it this way as well and do I form
[00:43:34] this structure or this structure or am I
[00:43:35] meant to read into this or not and all
[00:43:37] those micro decisions and you know that
[00:43:39] there's a much longer discussion but
[00:43:42] you just give it a go and you see how it
[00:43:44] is and then you start optimizing and
[00:43:45] then after a few weeks it starts
[00:43:47] becoming easier and easier and after a
[00:43:49] few months that becomes a normal way
[00:43:50] that you start thinking about things and
[00:43:52] the great thing is that because of
[00:43:53] neuroplasticity the brain's ability to
[00:43:55] mold itself the more you think like this
[00:43:57] the more you're able to to hold on to
[00:43:59] because information is Consolidated much
[00:44:01] more rapidly and therefore you're able
[00:44:03] to learn for more sources simultaneously
[00:44:05] you're able to handle much larger
[00:44:07] volumes of information and you're able
[00:44:09] to ride over a lot of the external
[00:44:11] variability of learning whether you've
[00:44:13] got a good resource or a good teacher or
[00:44:14] whatever it is a lot of those external
[00:44:16] variations will be able to ride over it
[00:44:18] I like the fact that the extreme
[00:44:20] opposite of this is repetition like if
[00:44:22] I've got to urgently learn something I'm
[00:44:25] inclined to go all right I've got a
[00:44:26] couple of lines and I'm going to change
[00:44:27] my shooting angle and I'm going to say
[00:44:28] something else and that's like the enemy
[00:44:30] of this this is exactly yeah so I'm glad
[00:44:34] you've shot that down from the get-go
[00:44:36] let me very quickly touch on the idea of
[00:44:39] when you're teaching someone else
[00:44:41] something so you know you can't just be
[00:44:43] like okay let's start a meeting and
[00:44:45] therefore let me teach you about all of
[00:44:46] this and then go practice it for the
[00:44:48] next few weeks and then we'll come back
[00:44:49] and then I'll teach you some stuff right
[00:44:50] so one of the things that we want to do
[00:44:52] is we want to get them engaged in this
[00:44:54] process so usually most of the people
[00:44:57] here when you're in a meeting you
[00:44:58] actually have some Authority in terms of
[00:44:59] what the other person can actually be
[00:45:00] doing in that meeting how they can be
[00:45:01] thinking about it so one of the ways I
[00:45:03] like to start off if I know that we're
[00:45:05] touching on something that's reasonably
[00:45:07] complex is to get them to create
[00:45:10] a structure in terms of what they think
[00:45:12] what we are talking about today is how
[00:45:13] they Envision it and what the purpose is
[00:45:15] you know almost put them in the position
[00:45:16] of that owner and figure out what that
[00:45:18] big picture is I want you to map it up
[00:45:19] and get them thinking about it from
[00:45:21] their prior knowledge to build their
[00:45:23] schema to begin with and then from there
[00:45:25] we can start asking probing questions
[00:45:27] some good questions that we can start
[00:45:28] with are what part of what you've
[00:45:30] started there do you think is the most
[00:45:32] important one that we need to like nail
[00:45:33] in first or potentially watch
[00:45:35] relationship which process is going to
[00:45:37] be the most important thing and the
[00:45:38] second thing when I say the word Black
[00:45:40] Swan is just put your hand up if you're
[00:45:41] familiar with this term Black Swan
[00:45:43] great so the second question would be
[00:45:46] what are the black swans to your model
[00:45:48] right and that activates again that
[00:45:50] higher level of thinking because
[00:45:51] remember the first principle here all of
[00:45:53] this is activating their brain and that
[00:45:54] level of thinking and learning that is
[00:45:56] more reflective of true expertise rather
[00:45:58] than something that's lower level or
[00:46:00] more passive after they've done that
[00:46:01] process and they've refined that schema
[00:46:03] you'll probably find that the
[00:46:04] conversation that ensues when you just
[00:46:05] go through and start talking about it
[00:46:07] they're able to bring a lot more value
[00:46:09] to the table they're able to engage with
[00:46:11] the content more organically they're
[00:46:12] more curious about things because now
[00:46:13] they have a hypothesis they have
[00:46:15] invested cognitive resources into
[00:46:16] building they want to know why it's
[00:46:17] wrong right and all of you are probably
[00:46:18] doing that while we were talking today
[00:46:20] you were building your own kind of model
[00:46:21] of how it works and that informs the
[00:46:23] types of questions you tend to ask and
[00:46:25] this increases the value of what you
[00:46:27] teach them correct massively because now
[00:46:30] it's the it's the gift that keeps on
[00:46:31] giving you test them this that's the
[00:46:33] starting point a lot of the time what we
[00:46:35] worry about is we taught them something
[00:46:36] and it's will they even remember what I
[00:46:38] just taught them right but what it
[00:46:40] should be is I just taught them this a
[00:46:41] week later they're coming back and now
[00:46:43] they know know even more because there
[00:46:45] was a gap that they found you know from
[00:46:47] their model and they realized that it
[00:46:48] wasn't filled through your explanation
[00:46:50] and it wasn't filled in their own schema
[00:46:51] so I mean personality is dependent you
[00:46:54] have to have someone that's actually
[00:46:55] willing to look at it which you know can
[00:46:57] be hard to find but you know they will
[00:46:58] go and actually look at it a little bit
[00:47:00] more and they'll you know they'll come
[00:47:01] back and then it becomes a lot more of a
[00:47:03] you know like a real relationship rather
[00:47:06] than just like you know basically
[00:47:08] waterfall yeah it's like they're
[00:47:09] questioning and searching from the
[00:47:11] get-go right and the amount of ownership
[00:47:13] that that places on them yeah that's a
[00:47:15] big thing and I don't need to explain
[00:47:16] that yeah well you just that that's a
[00:47:19] great method because it actually makes
[00:47:21] them aware of their competency
[00:47:24] um you know local hierarchical
[00:47:25] competency and it kind of makes them
[00:47:27] jump a level where they realize oh
[00:47:28] actually I'm sure yes yeah it brings
[00:47:30] them into that yeah conscious and
[00:47:32] competency is a magical you know first
[00:47:34] step that's the hardest step though yeah
[00:47:36] and actually one other thing this is the
[00:47:38] final thing that I'll mention here is
[00:47:39] that when you do engage with people in
[00:47:41] this way not only is it increasing the
[00:47:43] sort of ownership of it but it's also
[00:47:45] familiarizing themselves with not
[00:47:46] knowing and navigating the uncertainty
[00:47:49] of the topic so it's an incredibly
[00:47:50] important thing is that often especially
[00:47:53] if you're working with someone that's a
[00:47:54] little bit younger and is experienced
[00:47:55] they're going to be used to having
[00:47:57] certainty in things and they're going to
[00:47:58] be wanting that certainty but sometimes
[00:48:00] what's most important is what can you
[00:48:02] build out of the uncertainty and how
[00:48:03] long can you stay in that uncertainty to
[00:48:05] build something that makes sense to get
[00:48:07] to certainty a lot of people are too
[00:48:08] eager to get to that certainty and so
[00:48:10] they sacrifice building that structure
[00:48:12] so it'll be like this I need certainty
[00:48:13] here so they just build that and they
[00:48:15] lock it in and it's like oh this other
[00:48:16] thing comes in it's like oh but it
[00:48:18] doesn't it doesn't fit doesn't make
[00:48:19] sense they don't know how to navigate
[00:48:20] that starting in this method starts with
[00:48:22] uncertainty because there's no
[00:48:23] expectation they're going to get it
[00:48:24] right no one in their right mind would
[00:48:26] say hey build this mental model and then
[00:48:27] if it's wrong it's like you suck you
[00:48:29] know you well as long as you don't say
[00:48:30] that you know so it creates not only
[00:48:33] sort of the mutual understanding that
[00:48:36] that uncertainty is okay the familiarity
[00:48:38] for them to navigate that uncertainty by
[00:48:40] themselves so even when you're not there
[00:48:41] and if they take on a higher level
[00:48:43] responsibility they have all the
[00:48:45] groundwork they know how to think about
[00:48:46] it or they are lacking now is the cue
[00:48:49] yeah okay thank you everyone for taking
[00:48:52] the time to come in yeah
[00:48:55] foreign

=== Learning Coach Rates Obsidian App ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2gteISubPM

[00:00:00] okay we're going on to the app section
[00:00:02] now obsidian I I think it's obsidian is
[00:00:05] properly rated uh because I know it's
[00:00:08] getting popular and it is popular and
[00:00:10] there are lots of other people and
[00:00:11] there's other you know YouTubers and
[00:00:13] influence and stuff that can talk about
[00:00:14] obsidian much better than I can I think
[00:00:16] it's a very good app I use it for for
[00:00:19] some purposes I think for studying
[00:00:21] specifically I don't think obsidian is
[00:00:22] great because it runs into the same
[00:00:24] issues as linear note taking and
[00:00:25] inorganic relational forming and it
[00:00:28] doesn't reflect your higher order
[00:00:29] knowledge structures as it would if you
[00:00:31] were to encode it properly from a
[00:00:33] cognitive perspective but I think as an
[00:00:36] app to help you as a second brain
[00:00:37] especially I think it's a great app so
[00:00:39] I'd say properly rated it's got a lot of
[00:00:41] popularity it's growing and I think it's
[00:00:42] well deserved


=== Are you about to burn out? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqTrKE72pzg

[00:00:00] if you're getting to the point where
[00:00:01] you're like Optima and by the evening
[00:00:02] you're like a little dull and the next
[00:00:04] morning you're afternoon by the next day
[00:00:05] you're a little bit dull that's
[00:00:06] sustainable but if you're getting to the
[00:00:08] point where you're in that maintenance
[00:00:09] mode where you're actually you're being
[00:00:11] like what you're what you're feeling is
[00:00:12] not that you're recharging the top that
[00:00:14] feeling of like recovering and coming
[00:00:16] back is literally like you just
[00:00:18] fluctuating at this bottom while it's
[00:00:19] slowly getting worse and worse and what
[00:00:21] that feels like is you never feel like
[00:00:23] you're super super sharp you just wake
[00:00:25] up and you're tired and you're exhausted
[00:00:26] and you start exhausted and you get even
[00:00:28] more exhausted and the point that you
[00:00:30] stop is where you feel like you're not
[00:00:32] even completely functional anymore and
[00:00:33] then the next morning you barely just
[00:00:35] get to the point where you can function
[00:00:36] and then you get to the point where you
[00:00:38] can't function like that means that
[00:00:39] you're at the bottom already kind of
[00:00:41] fluctuating there and that sustained
[00:00:43] over a period of time creates burnout


=== How to do scheduling properly? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkFjC2JIKJk

[00:00:00] scheduling scheduling is overrated
[00:00:03] scheduling is important you should be
[00:00:05] able to do good basic scheduling
[00:00:07] following some very basic good
[00:00:09] principles that will help you to keep on
[00:00:11] track and have decent time management
[00:00:12] but people think about scheduling as if
[00:00:15] it's going to be the thing that saves
[00:00:16] their life if you've got decent enough
[00:00:18] just very very basic scheduling and you
[00:00:20] still have problems more scheduling or
[00:00:22] better scheduling is probably not going
[00:00:23] to help you it's going to be another
[00:00:25] kind of issue which is a which is a
[00:00:27] whole other topic around time management
[00:00:29] versus task management but overall
[00:00:30] scheduling is a little overhyped


=== How to use method of loci correctly? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuL3yAieH_g

[00:00:00] method of low-cut method of loci is I
[00:00:03] think it's overrated and I teach it very
[00:00:06] very very late in in my program because
[00:00:08] there's two things number one if you
[00:00:10] learn the method of loci system it
[00:00:11] allows you to memorize a lot of content
[00:00:12] but the content is often not very
[00:00:14] practically useful first of all you're
[00:00:16] memorizing it only for lower order needs
[00:00:17] so you can only use it for like basic
[00:00:18] recall and the other thing is that
[00:00:20] you're not able to encode a lot of
[00:00:23] information on a diverse range of topics
[00:00:25] for a long period of time because it
[00:00:26] relies on you having this kind of like
[00:00:28] distinct palaces or loci and then they
[00:00:31] start overlapping and it gets even more
[00:00:32] confusing so it's a great almost like a
[00:00:34] party trick or it's really good for very
[00:00:36] specific instances when adopted in the
[00:00:38] right way but generally I think
[00:00:40] especially like memory Champions that
[00:00:42] are like oh this is going to change your
[00:00:44] life like if you learn this technique
[00:00:45] you're going to be able to like smash
[00:00:46] through your study as an Acer that's
[00:00:48] just completely not like supported and
[00:00:50] frankly I think irresponsible so from
[00:00:52] that view I think method of Loca is
[00:00:53] probably overrated


=== The Truth About Motivation ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpOtfLdGQbE

[00:00:00] for motivation for those with executive
[00:00:01] dysfunction I think one of the most
[00:00:03] important things about motivation is
[00:00:04] understanding that motivation is really
[00:00:06] valuable to have in reserve when you
[00:00:08] really need it but if you find yourself
[00:00:09] relying on needing motivation very often
[00:00:12] then it probably means that there's
[00:00:13] other things that are going on you don't
[00:00:15] want most of your behavior to be driven
[00:00:17] by motivation because that suggests that
[00:00:19] the system that you've created around
[00:00:20] trying to create behaviors and actions
[00:00:22] is making you not want to do it right
[00:00:24] like if you naturally wanted to let's
[00:00:27] take play in games for example like
[00:00:28] games are designed to be fun they're
[00:00:30] designed for you to like get into them
[00:00:31] very easily very quickly so you don't
[00:00:34] tend to need motivation to play games
[00:00:36] same thing with social media social
[00:00:38] media is designed to like suck you and
[00:00:39] get you hooked right you know you often
[00:00:41] don't find people saying I need to be
[00:00:42] more motivated so that I can binge
[00:00:44] Netflix or you know like scroll through
[00:00:46] scroll through my Instagram so the
[00:00:48] things that we need motivation for are
[00:00:50] the ones where we can't create a system
[00:00:52] in an environment that directs us
[00:00:54] towards desired Behavior but that should
[00:00:56] always be the first option if you try to
[00:00:57] create that desired Behavior


=== Problem with tying self-worth to grades ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE8zg3Hcp8U

[00:00:00] Grace grades are super overrated people
[00:00:03] tie their self-worth to it and this is
[00:00:05] coming from someone that actually you
[00:00:06] know like I make a living from teaching
[00:00:09] people to get better grades and I would
[00:00:11] say that you know when when you're
[00:00:13] fixing on grades as your outcome and
[00:00:15] that's what is like the most important
[00:00:17] to you and that's like conditional for
[00:00:19] you to feel good about yourself I mean
[00:00:21] that's just like nothing about that is
[00:00:23] is healthy or productive or even leads
[00:00:26] to success long term so grades overrated


=== The problem with tutoring ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jkRmjWu4vY

[00:00:00] okay Dustin tutoring overrated or
[00:00:02] underrated tutoring is
[00:00:06] um very dependent obviously on the tutor
[00:00:08] but generally speaking and especially as
[00:00:10] an industry I'd say is grossly grocery
[00:00:13] overrated because it can lead to
[00:00:15] dependency it can lead to a lot of
[00:00:18] people spoon feeding tutoring is
[00:00:20] completely unregulated as well as an
[00:00:22] industry and I know for a fact being in
[00:00:24] the industry for so many years there's a
[00:00:27] lot of ethical gray lines there so yeah
[00:00:31] I'd say generally speaking overrated if
[00:00:33] you need tutoring there's probably
[00:00:34] another issue and if you don't need
[00:00:36] tutoring why are you going to tutoring


=== Why you need self awareness to get a job? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpbkB3VtaF8

[00:00:00] the second thing is try to develop some
[00:00:02] level of self-awareness and when I say
[00:00:05] self-awareness I'm not talking about
[00:00:06] this like rural hippie just you know be
[00:00:08] more in line with your chakras like sit
[00:00:10] so that your meridians are you know in
[00:00:12] tune like when I'm saying self-awareness
[00:00:14] I'm just simply saying be aware of what
[00:00:16] you're doing why you're doing it and
[00:00:17] whether there is alignment there and
[00:00:19] start making some small changes to those
[00:00:22] why am I talking about this number one
[00:00:24] the obvious thing is that once you start
[00:00:25] being in tune to your processes and your
[00:00:27] intentions and whether they're aligned
[00:00:29] you'll start being able to optimize a
[00:00:30] lot of things


=== Learning Coach Reacts to TikTok Studying Advice | Part 2 ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFMcceRukG0

[00:00:00] how straight A students memorize
[00:00:02] textbook this is terrible oh come on
[00:00:07] study hack is how I became a doctor you
[00:00:09] can literally memorize hundreds of pages
[00:00:11] of notes by using this technique what
[00:00:13] type of doctor is he is he like a real
[00:00:15] doctor hey guys it's Dr Justin here I'm
[00:00:18] a full-time learning coach and former
[00:00:19] medical doctor and this is part two of
[00:00:22] me reacting to study advice from tiktok
[00:00:24] now in the last video a lot of you told
[00:00:26] me that you really loved it thank you
[00:00:28] and some of the comments were like
[00:00:29] Justin why are you so calm you know
[00:00:32] you're so calm at reacting to these uh
[00:00:34] to this Tick Tock advice and I can tell
[00:00:36] you that that is out the window in this
[00:00:37] video because this part two was filmed
[00:00:39] at the same time as part one so you'll
[00:00:41] see that I'm coming in hot I've got 30
[00:00:43] minutes of pent-up frustration and my
[00:00:45] patience was wearing really thin at this
[00:00:47] stage so you know that's the reason why
[00:00:49] but I hope you enjoy it towards the end
[00:00:51] there's this particular Tick Tock that
[00:00:53] talks about a strategy that I see most
[00:00:55] students using however there are some
[00:00:58] significant changes that you can make
[00:00:59] that make it a lot more effective and
[00:01:00] I'm going to be introducing those to you
[00:01:02] in this video so stick around to the end
[00:01:04] to find out
[00:01:05] is an absolutely life-changing technique
[00:01:07] that improves your memory by 140 and it
[00:01:11] can work for anyone good memory is
[00:01:13] everything it works for remembering exam
[00:01:15] answers or learning new things
[00:01:17] remembering important patterns for
[00:01:19] making a profitable trade or just simply
[00:01:21] making mental notes of things you must
[00:01:23] remember and I've been doing this for my
[00:01:25] car keys all along without even knowing
[00:01:28] it's okay that is a good hook right it
[00:01:32] doesn't over promise 140 is very
[00:01:34] believable and it like it's engaging and
[00:01:37] it didn't have to over promise anything
[00:01:39] like this is good it's called the low C
[00:01:41] method and here's how you do it
[00:01:44] is uh the plural of locus such as your
[00:01:48] house imagine leaving a small piece of
[00:01:50] information at a certain location in
[00:01:52] that area in your mind connect the
[00:01:54] information to a particular place so if
[00:01:57] you need to remember 10 things make a
[00:01:59] mental route through your house for 10
[00:02:01] stops whenever you need to remember them
[00:02:03] visualize yourself walking through your
[00:02:05] route and stopping at each location and
[00:02:08] getting the information it's crazy now
[00:02:10] now what was the color of my shirt in
[00:02:12] the beginning
[00:02:14] okay
[00:02:15] so um the Metallica is very powerful
[00:02:18] however it's not something that you can
[00:02:21] rely on long term and the reason is
[00:02:22] because and methodology is actually one
[00:02:25] of the first memory techniques I ever
[00:02:27] learned I learned it when I was I think
[00:02:29] 16 and it was like man this is amazing
[00:02:32] and it is like it is a great technique
[00:02:35] however there are a few caveats to this
[00:02:38] the first one is that it's not scalable
[00:02:40] with more volumes of information when
[00:02:42] you have to hold on to all those pieces
[00:02:44] of information for a longer period of
[00:02:45] time and the reason is because in order
[00:02:47] for this technique to work you need to
[00:02:48] have like a location in your mind like
[00:02:50] your house I used to use my school but
[00:02:52] as you need to learn more and more
[00:02:54] things more and more locations sort of
[00:02:56] unlock it's like your map is expanding
[00:02:59] so I would have my house and then I'd
[00:03:01] have my school and then I'd start doing
[00:03:02] my school and the walk home from school
[00:03:04] and then the place that I'll detour
[00:03:06] while I'm going home from school and
[00:03:08] then my home and then going up there and
[00:03:10] then my you know my parents had a shop
[00:03:11] at the time and I'd be walking to the
[00:03:13] shop and then I'd use their shop and
[00:03:15] then I'd use a very next door and then
[00:03:16] so it will become this huge huge network
[00:03:18] but as your knowledge requirements grow
[00:03:22] the more things you need to place you
[00:03:24] just run out of places you just run out
[00:03:26] of places and it doesn't even take that
[00:03:28] long especially if you're in University
[00:03:30] there's so much stuff do you need to
[00:03:32] remember sometimes that you can run out
[00:03:35] of places within like just your first
[00:03:37] session or even like a you know the
[00:03:39] first week and so if you need to hold on
[00:03:40] to a lot of stuff for a long period of
[00:03:42] time it doesn't really tend to work and
[00:03:43] it can actually be more confusing
[00:03:45] because you start forgetting like which
[00:03:46] location had what so that's the first
[00:03:48] limitation by all means try to use this
[00:03:50] you'll feel this for yourself everyone
[00:03:51] feels this the second thing is that the
[00:03:53] information that is being stored is it
[00:03:56] improves your memory but it doesn't do
[00:03:58] it in a way that creates conceptually
[00:04:00] meaningful relationships so it forces
[00:04:02] the relationships and connections for
[00:04:04] information in your brain by assigning
[00:04:06] it relevance through basic Association
[00:04:08] psychology and so it does make the
[00:04:10] information stickier however it doesn't
[00:04:12] mean that you can use and apply and
[00:04:14] manipulate that information Asian in
[00:04:16] ways that are necessarily useful and so
[00:04:19] as a result I think it's kind of a
[00:04:21] compromise because you could have all
[00:04:24] the benefits of the method of loci
[00:04:26] improve memory the stickier information
[00:04:28] being able to recall it more freely but
[00:04:30] instead of creating connections with
[00:04:32] locations and things in your house that
[00:04:34] are actually meaningless you can create
[00:04:36] connections with your prior knowledge or
[00:04:40] other pieces of information in the
[00:04:42] actual thing of what you're learning and
[00:04:44] so you're getting the connections you're
[00:04:45] increasing the relevance the memory is
[00:04:47] stickier it's being more like there's
[00:04:49] more association with it however those
[00:04:52] networks and relationships are more
[00:04:54] meaningful so it means that you can
[00:04:56] actually retrieve apply manipulate that
[00:04:59] information in more useful ways for like
[00:05:02] complex problem solving curveball
[00:05:03] questions discussions you know the the
[00:05:05] things that really separate the average
[00:05:07] students from the top students I teach
[00:05:09] this as a memory technique for root
[00:05:11] memorization only for the little bits of
[00:05:13] facts and details that just can't be
[00:05:16] integrated through something else but
[00:05:18] it's I would still consider it like a
[00:05:20] last resort option it's a great party
[00:05:22] trick though
[00:05:25] students memorize textbook and notes you
[00:05:28] can use the one two three method first
[00:05:30] read silently in your head and write
[00:05:33] down everything you remember on a blank
[00:05:35] piece of paper repeat step one and two
[00:05:38] three times follow for more study tips
[00:05:44] foreign
[00:05:47] part of this is terrible the most
[00:05:51] efficient way to memorize it's not even
[00:05:53] is this how straight a student's
[00:05:55] memorize textbooks and notes well
[00:05:57] Straight A's students
[00:05:59] at least straight A students they're not
[00:06:00] killing themselves studying every hour
[00:06:02] of every day are not memorizing
[00:06:04] textbooks and notes because that's not
[00:06:08] really how Learning Works
[00:06:13] and the one two three it's like the
[00:06:16] stupidest it's just like what I'm gonna
[00:06:19] teach you a study method it's called the
[00:06:22] one two three four five method Step One
[00:06:25] Is to learn the material step two is to
[00:06:28] repeat it
[00:06:30] and then you do step one and two
[00:06:34] three more times and then four more
[00:06:37] times and then five more times it's like
[00:06:42] this is like there's just really nothing
[00:06:44] going for this really it's a just a
[00:06:48] terrible method like look there's a
[00:06:50] generative effect from free recall that
[00:06:52] is entirely deep processing dependent
[00:06:54] but I think anyone that has even a basic
[00:06:59] understanding of learning science and
[00:07:02] how learning actually works at least
[00:07:05] like I missed the last thing she read
[00:07:07] was from 1955.
[00:07:11] the like it basically ignores the last
[00:07:13] like four decades worth of Neuroscience
[00:07:16] and learning science research
[00:07:18] um so
[00:07:20] yeah that's bad
[00:07:22] I like I just can't think of anything
[00:07:24] good to say about it and the thing is
[00:07:26] like I like I hold that one to a higher
[00:07:29] standard because I like know that that
[00:07:32] person has a business
[00:07:35] teaching study tips
[00:07:37] and that makes me
[00:07:39] sad uh
[00:07:42] and it it's like it creates problems
[00:07:46] like if you are not qualified
[00:07:48] please don't like yeah people people
[00:07:52] people depend on you for your advice
[00:07:53] this is one of the best only study
[00:07:55] methods that actually works for me as a
[00:07:57] college student and that I wish I had
[00:07:58] sooner because it literally changed the
[00:07:59] game for me okay so first thing you're
[00:08:01] gonna do is open the app called Notions
[00:08:02] the same girl that was like this is one
[00:08:05] of the only methods that works for me
[00:08:06] and then she was the one that talked
[00:08:08] about the group study thing is that is
[00:08:10] this the same girl
[00:08:14] yeah it is okay so she I wonder how many
[00:08:17] of the best and only methods she
[00:08:19] actually has okay as a college student
[00:08:21] and that I wish I had sooner because it
[00:08:23] literally changed the game okay but the
[00:08:24] last one was pretty good
[00:08:26] it's my favorite note-taking app because
[00:08:28] it had this new feature called notion AI
[00:08:30] please
[00:08:32] [Music]
[00:08:39] I asked it to explain a concept for my
[00:08:42] computer Graphics
[00:08:45] writing is also just so much more
[00:08:47] convenient with notion AI because I can
[00:08:49] ask it to make text longer or shorter
[00:08:51] it's obviously just so helpful I even
[00:08:52] asked it to help me brainstorm a topic
[00:08:54] for an essay okay and it easily came up
[00:08:56] with the topic this is your sign to get
[00:08:58] started with notion so you can unlock
[00:08:59] the power of notion AI for only ten
[00:09:00] dollars a month
[00:09:02] right sponsored by notion
[00:09:04] um Okay so
[00:09:06] I thought it was going to go down a
[00:09:07] certain track and it didn't and I'm very
[00:09:09] happy about that because it would have
[00:09:11] been you know like bad if it did the way
[00:09:15] that she talked about it was actually
[00:09:16] pretty good using it as a springboard
[00:09:18] just starting the thought process just
[00:09:21] getting ideas just getting small
[00:09:23] explanations about stuff like
[00:09:24] essentially a better Google search like
[00:09:26] instead of reading through and searching
[00:09:27] for a bunch of stuff you get an
[00:09:28] explanation right there I thought she
[00:09:30] was going to talk about how you can get
[00:09:31] it to paraphrase things for you
[00:09:34] as as if like that paraphrasing it's
[00:09:36] like now your notes and therefore it's
[00:09:37] better and that would have been bad
[00:09:39] because the entire purpose of
[00:09:41] paraphrasing is that your brain is
[00:09:43] actually the one that has to think about
[00:09:45] how to paraphrase and summarize and
[00:09:47] simplify the information like the
[00:09:48] benefit of the learning is happening
[00:09:50] because you are the one that's actually
[00:09:52] doing it if you get AI to do it for you
[00:09:54] it is the same as like going to the gym
[00:09:56] seeing a weight that's really heavy
[00:09:57] wanting to get stronger and then sort of
[00:09:59] paying someone to lift the weight for
[00:10:01] you right like it doesn't make sense but
[00:10:04] the way that she talked about it that's
[00:10:05] fine that's fine if you're using it in
[00:10:08] the ways that she talked about it and
[00:10:10] that's fine but obviously you know like
[00:10:13] most of you guys know that I've got a
[00:10:14] problem with using notion for studying
[00:10:15] because of the fact that it's linear and
[00:10:17] it doesn't really allow for organic
[00:10:18] relationships to be expressed in a way
[00:10:21] that's actually organic and represents
[00:10:23] how information is structured in the
[00:10:25] brain again at the end of the day it's a
[00:10:26] software that is made by software
[00:10:28] developers they don't have any learning
[00:10:30] Science Background or expertise and
[00:10:32] they're just marketing it to students
[00:10:33] there's like a as a note-taking app so
[00:10:35] this study hack is how I became a doctor
[00:10:37] this technique is going to change your
[00:10:39] entire experience of school if you use
[00:10:41] it you'll get an A on every test you
[00:10:43] ever take again I got a 2.6 my first
[00:10:46] semester of college and then somebody
[00:10:47] taught me this technique you know what I
[00:10:49] don't understand and I'm not I'm not
[00:10:51] necessarily saying it's like that's the
[00:10:52] case with this guy
[00:10:54] but
[00:10:56] you know like I'll have videos where and
[00:10:58] I'll have like hours and hours of videos
[00:11:00] that I upload for free on my YouTube
[00:11:02] just trying to teach people stuff and
[00:11:03] giving them value and then like every
[00:11:05] few videos I talk about the fact that
[00:11:07] hey if you are interested by the way
[00:11:09] I've got this program you can join it if
[00:11:12] you want and then like so many people
[00:11:14] give me hate whereas so many other
[00:11:16] people they're just like it's just like
[00:11:18] in your face like buy my stuff like buy
[00:11:21] my book buy my course and then the
[00:11:23] statements are like this is gonna change
[00:11:25] your life this is gonna this is like the
[00:11:27] miracle like this is Jesus manifest as a
[00:11:30] study technique and people are like yes
[00:11:33] yes I love it it's so good thank you for
[00:11:35] helping me I don't get it I must be
[00:11:37] missing something first semester of
[00:11:38] college and then somebody taught me this
[00:11:40] technique and I got a 4.0 every semester
[00:11:42] since it's why I'm Dr Brad today and I'm
[00:11:45] going to teach it to you right now first
[00:11:46] you take notes if you're a bad note
[00:11:48] taker just use someone else's then you
[00:11:51] make a copy of those notes leaving
[00:11:53] blanks in keywords then when you study
[00:11:56] you mentally try to fill in those blanks
[00:11:58] referring to your notes when you get
[00:11:59] stuck you can literally memorize
[00:12:01] hundreds of pages of notes by using this
[00:12:03] technique once you memorize the first
[00:12:05] line without referring to your notes
[00:12:06] move on to the second line memorize your
[00:12:09] notes line by line remember you only
[00:12:11] fill in the blanks mentally and once you
[00:12:14] memorize the entire page move on to the
[00:12:16] next one then keep practicing until you
[00:12:18] memorize your entire set of notes I know
[00:12:20] there may be software out there or you
[00:12:22] might want to write this on a computer
[00:12:23] but I really think it helps to write it
[00:12:25] by hand
[00:12:25] what about doctor is he is he like a
[00:12:28] real doctor okay let me let me give you
[00:12:30] the summary right the reason Dr Brad
[00:12:33] became a doctor is that he likely has a
[00:12:37] higher level of deep processing ability
[00:12:39] and does not inherently struggle with
[00:12:41] making higher order connections without
[00:12:43] having a higher order technique this is
[00:12:46] an example of deep process tanking which
[00:12:48] is what I call it where you have people
[00:12:49] that have higher innate abilities for
[00:12:51] deep processing and they're able to get
[00:12:52] away with having ineffective techniques
[00:12:54] but
[00:12:56] um you know what all it has this is all
[00:12:58] I'm gonna say about this use this
[00:13:00] technique and then see how it works for
[00:13:03] you and then leave a comment let's just
[00:13:05] let the stats do the talking and and
[00:13:08] well here's the thing right like if it
[00:13:10] doesn't work for you please actually
[00:13:11] come back and tell everyone how your
[00:13:14] experience was I know that people often
[00:13:16] like this is the problem right people
[00:13:17] don't like talking about their failures
[00:13:19] and that's why we only get people that
[00:13:22] have succeeded with things talking about
[00:13:23] how they succeeded we don't get the
[00:13:25] million other people that did the exact
[00:13:27] same thing and failed use this give it a
[00:13:29] go and then see how you find it I'm just
[00:13:32] going to leave it at that I'm just going
[00:13:34] to leave it at that see I don't I don't
[00:13:36] find these tips myself and I'm just
[00:13:38] thinking like is this was this like the
[00:13:40] cream of The Chronicles
[00:13:41] [Music]
[00:13:49] after reviewing your notes created
[00:13:52] summary sheets
[00:13:55] after the art of fitting each chapter
[00:13:57] into a single
[00:13:58] okay so like I don't like that it's
[00:14:00] linear but the reason that this works is
[00:14:02] because it forces prioritization which
[00:14:04] is the you know one of the highest
[00:14:06] levels of fire order thinking is that it
[00:14:08] forces you to evaluate the importance
[00:14:10] and validity of every concept and then
[00:14:13] find you have to find a way to then
[00:14:14] Express that in a concise way so you
[00:14:18] know apart from the fact that it's
[00:14:19] linear
[00:14:20] um and it's still relatively isolated it
[00:14:22] is still going to force a little bit
[00:14:24] more of that higher order learning so
[00:14:25] that's why you may find that this
[00:14:27] technique is effective for you if you
[00:14:29] made this more non-linear you would find
[00:14:31] that it's more challenging but also more
[00:14:32] effective
[00:14:34] rather whiteboard and a marker test your
[00:14:38] brain by writing down everything you
[00:14:40] remember
[00:14:42] use symbols and abbreviations to make
[00:14:45] the process quicker
[00:14:48] so I think the reason they're using the
[00:14:50] Whiteboard is so that you can erase
[00:14:51] things and then do it again so you can
[00:14:53] do it like Point by point but that's
[00:14:55] actually detrimental you don't want to
[00:14:56] do a point by point you want to be able
[00:14:58] to get everything down that you remember
[00:15:00] and then integrate and then connect it
[00:15:02] with as many things as you can so I
[00:15:04] would like
[00:15:06] look not everyone's got a tablet I
[00:15:08] understand that but if you've got a
[00:15:09] tablet and you can write on a tablet
[00:15:11] with Infinite Canvas that would be a lot
[00:15:13] better for doing this rather than a
[00:15:15] whiteboard marker or just get a big
[00:15:17] piece of paper like a A2 piece of paper
[00:15:19] just get a pencil wearing a pen and just
[00:15:22] start like writing and drawing and
[00:15:24] mapping the connections on it it's going
[00:15:26] to be way harder but it's going to be
[00:15:27] more effective
[00:15:30] [Music]
[00:15:37] but hey you know like
[00:15:39] yeah not bad not bad here are some study
[00:15:42] tips that I think helped me get my
[00:15:44] really good grades when I was a student
[00:15:45] so I graduated with a first class
[00:15:47] distinction from an ivy league
[00:15:49] university in America the University of
[00:15:51] Pennsylvania I went to Oxford for two
[00:15:53] masters and for my first Masters I got
[00:15:55] the best thesis award for my overall
[00:15:58] cohort so what I used to do is I make
[00:16:00] condensed one pager or one paper notes
[00:16:03] try to fit well one of the things I'll
[00:16:05] start with is like it doesn't sound like
[00:16:07] she's over promising and she started by
[00:16:09] saying like this is what I think helped
[00:16:10] me and I think that's a good stop as
[00:16:12] well but I think a lot of people will
[00:16:14] probably miss that and they'll just be
[00:16:16] like ah this person did well I'm gonna
[00:16:18] follow everything that they say and
[00:16:19] that's another reason why when I talk
[00:16:20] about the methods that I teach I'm
[00:16:22] always kind of emphasizing for you to
[00:16:24] think about the techniques in and of
[00:16:25] themselves think about the method don't
[00:16:26] take it as it's from me therefore it
[00:16:29] works take it as a the method makes it I
[00:16:32] understand the theory it checks out and
[00:16:35] I'm gonna experiment on it myself like
[00:16:37] that's always a mentality that you
[00:16:38] should have with any type of study
[00:16:40] advice try to fit an entire chapter into
[00:16:43] like a two-sided piece of paper Okay so
[00:16:45] again the reason that this works is
[00:16:47] because it's forcing that evaluation
[00:16:48] which is at higher order of learning any
[00:16:50] technique that forces you to simplify
[00:16:53] information evaluate how important
[00:16:55] things is create connections simplify it
[00:16:58] is going to be helpful because it is
[00:17:00] inherently an integrated process when
[00:17:03] you're trying to make these condensed
[00:17:04] notes the way that you can do it in a
[00:17:06] better way and and she may be doing this
[00:17:08] already maybe she talks about it later
[00:17:09] is don't just condense it like line by
[00:17:12] line or paragraph by paragraph try to
[00:17:14] get the whole concept in your head first
[00:17:16] and think about the easiest way to
[00:17:18] connect that concept with the other
[00:17:19] Concepts and simplify that it's going to
[00:17:22] be easier faster and more concise rather
[00:17:25] than just essentially paraphrasing each
[00:17:28] literal sentence that's not gonna be
[00:17:30] involving you know it's not it's not a
[00:17:32] very good learning process in your head
[00:17:33] and it's also not going to you know like
[00:17:35] obviously it's not going to be very
[00:17:36] effective but it's not going to be very
[00:17:38] effective in actually being able to fit
[00:17:40] that much information on such a small
[00:17:42] amount of of real estate you're like
[00:17:44] actively engaging your brain as you're
[00:17:46] making the notes and not just copying
[00:17:48] things word for word I'm also a visual
[00:17:50] thinker it's easy to see everything in
[00:17:52] like one page or like this so you know
[00:17:55] the concept of learning styles is very
[00:17:56] very ubiquitous like 90 something
[00:17:58] percent of the population believes in
[00:17:59] learning styles but there's no such
[00:18:01] thing as a learning style no one has a
[00:18:03] style that they are like naturally
[00:18:06] bitter in but they are learning
[00:18:07] preferences which is probably the the
[00:18:09] confusion here people do have
[00:18:11] preferences for how they like to learn
[00:18:12] but what we know with just the human
[00:18:14] brain in general as long as you've got a
[00:18:16] human brain that doesn't have some kind
[00:18:18] of pathological issue with it you're
[00:18:19] gonna benefit from mixed modal learning
[00:18:21] and visual learning is going to be
[00:18:23] easier for you the human brain has tens
[00:18:26] of thousands of times more efficient
[00:18:27] with processing visual information than
[00:18:30] like written like reading literal words
[00:18:33] and so using a visualization aspect to
[00:18:35] it is almost always going to be
[00:18:37] effective and this is why when you get
[00:18:39] good was non-linear like mind map note
[00:18:41] taking it's effective because you can
[00:18:43] create memory cues based on even just
[00:18:46] where on the page you decide to put the
[00:18:48] information so it creates like another
[00:18:50] little memory anchor one page or like
[00:18:52] just two pages do as many sample
[00:18:55] questions and answers as you can the
[00:18:58] thing with taking exams is that there is
[00:19:00] a way to answer it well you won't know
[00:19:03] this way unless you do it yourself and
[00:19:05] look at sample answers so that's not
[00:19:08] well I don't think that's like the best
[00:19:10] advice I think it works for her because
[00:19:12] again she probably has good deep
[00:19:13] processing to begin with but research on
[00:19:16] practicing for the test taking strategy
[00:19:18] has not been shown to be effective and
[00:19:19] in fact in some cases it can make things
[00:19:21] worse us doing lots of questions and
[00:19:23] answers is good however because it's
[00:19:25] testing yourself and it's finding gaps
[00:19:27] and it's a form of interleaved retrieval
[00:19:28] and it's you know it's forcing that kind
[00:19:30] of active retrieval of information so
[00:19:32] it's all good stuff and using it to
[00:19:34] figure out the style that they're going
[00:19:35] to ask you is good as well but I do know
[00:19:38] that there are a lot of students that
[00:19:39] base essentially like their entire
[00:19:41] studying and the way that they learn the
[00:19:43] information based on how they think
[00:19:45] they're going to be tested and that's
[00:19:46] not actually effective because the way
[00:19:48] that you're tested is not necessarily
[00:19:50] the best way for you to learn it in the
[00:19:52] first place and an example that I could
[00:19:54] give is like if you're cleaning your
[00:19:56] room so you might put all of your
[00:19:57] clothes in like one drawer and all of
[00:19:59] your socks in another drawer and all of
[00:20:00] your underwear like in another drawer
[00:20:02] but when you go to put on your clothes
[00:20:03] you're putting on like an outfit but
[00:20:06] when you're cleaning your room and
[00:20:07] organizing your room it's not a very
[00:20:09] efficient process to think about every
[00:20:12] outfit you could put on and therefore
[00:20:15] organize your room based on how you
[00:20:18] think every outfit might be placed right
[00:20:21] like you can see that it just becomes a
[00:20:23] very messy like weird sort of process
[00:20:25] and that's what this would be like you
[00:20:27] want to make sure that you've learned it
[00:20:29] first you've created connections and
[00:20:31] relationships and the knowledge is
[00:20:32] comfortable for you in the way that
[00:20:34] feels right for you to begin with and
[00:20:36] then you practice retrieving that
[00:20:38] knowledge if efficiently with sample
[00:20:41] questions and answers I don't think
[00:20:43] that's what she's necessarily said like
[00:20:44] I don't think she's saying to like learn
[00:20:46] for the test but I know that that's the
[00:20:48] way that a lot of people interpret that
[00:20:50] so this is not necessary for her but
[00:20:51] it's for you making sure that you don't
[00:20:53] fall into this common trap learn it for
[00:20:55] the way that's meant for you and then
[00:20:57] you can manipulate your knowledge
[00:20:58] however you need to that's a lot more
[00:21:01] efficient than pigeonholing yourself
[00:21:03] into learning in the way that you think
[00:21:05] you need to for the test but then
[00:21:07] suffering because it's cognitively not
[00:21:09] optimal
[00:21:10] document your mistakes I used to have an
[00:21:13] Excel spreadsheet where I literally
[00:21:14] wrote down
[00:21:15] um where was the question from what was
[00:21:17] the question question what did I answer
[00:21:19] why was it a mistake and what was the
[00:21:20] sample answer I would also take note if
[00:21:22] I make the mistake more than once you
[00:21:25] have to pay close attention to it comes
[00:21:27] to writing papers when you do your
[00:21:29] research and read one more thing to add
[00:21:30] so she that's a really good technique to
[00:21:32] do one more thing that you should do to
[00:21:34] that is also document the method of
[00:21:37] learning or studying or other factors
[00:21:39] that might have been at play at the time
[00:21:41] you learned it so what we know based on
[00:21:43] Modern Neuroscience research is that you
[00:21:45] can predict almost how good your memory
[00:21:48] about something is going to be based on
[00:21:50] what your brain does with the
[00:21:51] information when you learn it which
[00:21:53] means that if you've discovered a gap
[00:21:55] later there was something that happened
[00:21:57] that wasn't quite right at the time when
[00:21:59] you learned it like a week ago and so
[00:22:01] try to remember how you might have
[00:22:03] learned that and then when you look
[00:22:05] through your entire law you can find
[00:22:07] Trends and patterns like oh every time I
[00:22:10] use this technique or I study in this
[00:22:11] way I tend to forget it and that means
[00:22:13] that you can make really meaningful
[00:22:15] adjustments to your methods and you can
[00:22:17] create a really personalized learning
[00:22:19] system that really works when it comes
[00:22:21] to writing papers when you do your
[00:22:23] research and re-publish articles don't
[00:22:26] just look at the content by paying close
[00:22:28] attention to the format and how it's
[00:22:30] written she learned how to write how is
[00:22:33] this author making that argument why was
[00:22:35] it convincing writing like any other
[00:22:37] skill is something that needs to be
[00:22:39] trained and you can only learn it from
[00:22:42] looking at others and taking from them
[00:22:44] what you think is good
[00:22:47] that's probably the best one I have seen
[00:22:50] of this whole list that is definitely
[00:22:53] the best one I've seen there isn't
[00:22:55] anything that she said that I actually
[00:22:56] disagreed with there were just a few
[00:22:58] points in there that I would like say
[00:23:00] can make it even better and enhance it
[00:23:02] but that was
[00:23:04] good
[00:23:09] hmm so again immediately skip the call
[00:23:12] memorize anything using this is an
[00:23:14] oversimplification thing again that I've
[00:23:15] got a problem with right
[00:23:17] now let's see
[00:23:19] my fingers crossed maybe it's good
[00:23:21] not come on
[00:23:22] [Music]
[00:23:26] like duh
[00:23:33] [Music]
[00:23:38] great I hate it
[00:23:40] [Music]


=== What's the difference between cognitive load and mental fatigue? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bneBnmUa-Tg

[00:00:00] what we're trying to do when we're
[00:00:01] learning effectively is not directly
[00:00:03] increase the cognitive the point is to
[00:00:05] engage in the right type of thinking
[00:00:07] process and that right type of thinking
[00:00:09] process naturally involves mental
[00:00:11] exertion which is perceived as cognitive
[00:00:13] load the cognitive load is an indicator
[00:00:15] of the process when you're mentally
[00:00:17] tired the cognitive load is not
[00:00:19] increasing what's changing is your
[00:00:21] ability to tolerate that exertion when
[00:00:24] you're using the right type of cognitive
[00:00:25] load right type of process and you feel
[00:00:26] with a good cognitive load then you know
[00:00:29] that you're trying to do this back and
[00:00:30] forth comparative learning you're using
[00:00:32] those higher order learning principles
[00:00:33] and there is this idea that I'm in
[00:00:35] control and engaged with this learning
[00:00:37] how I'm forming this network and schema
[00:00:39] of knowledge and that's where our
[00:00:40] attention and our brain power is whereas
[00:00:43] if we're trying to do that but we're
[00:00:44] tired or it's taking us longer to find
[00:00:47] those relationships and build those
[00:00:48] networks and build those structures so
[00:00:50] you'd still understand that the form is
[00:00:52] correct you just feel that you're not
[00:00:54] able to tolerate it and and just keep
[00:00:56] going with it for as long


=== How to study math EFFECTIVELY? ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7LRghZCKDg

[00:00:00] the first thing is that math has a lot
[00:00:02] of procedure and conditional components
[00:00:03] to it a big part of math will be
[00:00:05] dependent on being able to do good
[00:00:06] interleaved retrieval however mass is
[00:00:09] typically taught with only a procedure
[00:00:11] and conditional Focus the declarative
[00:00:12] aspects of maths are often either not
[00:00:14] taught at all or like very very very
[00:00:16] understated but if you like literally
[00:00:17] just like go on YouTube and like listen
[00:00:19] to these math prodigies and establish
[00:00:21] professors of mathematics talk about the
[00:00:23] best way to learn math they all say that
[00:00:25] before you learn how to use the equation
[00:00:27] formulas you should understand in words
[00:00:29] what it is that you're learning and why
[00:00:31] you're learning it the difficulty is
[00:00:33] that when you first receive the
[00:00:35] information when it's taught to you it's
[00:00:36] taught to you in a way that is far
[00:00:38] removed from that level of conceptual
[00:00:39] understanding and that's where the
[00:00:41] effort comes in a big part of being able
[00:00:43] to solve complex problems like a lot of
[00:00:45] stuff in calculus is understanding
[00:00:47] conceptually how to approach the problem
[00:00:51] before you even think about the numbers
[00:00:52] and the formulas as part of it


=== Do not read the textbook linearly. ===
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgztzzxK4X4

[00:00:00] when you read a textbook there are
[00:00:01] chapter headings there are subheadings
[00:00:03] it's organized for you already you know
[00:00:05] it is organized when you learn it you
[00:00:07] are learning it in an organized
[00:00:08] structure still doesn't mean that you
[00:00:10] remembered it right it means that the
[00:00:11] organization was not meaningful it may
[00:00:13] be logical it may be meaningful for the
[00:00:15] author but for your brand from a
[00:00:17] cognitive architecture point of view it
[00:00:19] is not meaningful right and it's not
[00:00:21] going to be retained and here's the
[00:00:22] thing is that you don't have to store
[00:00:24] the information in the same way that it
[00:00:26] was presented to you what you should
[00:00:27] focus on is what is the way that I can
